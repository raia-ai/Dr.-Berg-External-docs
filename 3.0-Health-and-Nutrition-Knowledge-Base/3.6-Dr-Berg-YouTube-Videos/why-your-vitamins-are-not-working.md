- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=0s)** — So today we're going to talk about all the reasons why vitamins won't work.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=3s)** — The first thing to talk about is why do we need vitamins?
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=6s)** — Can't we get all of our vitamins from food?
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=8s)** — Many times you're not going to be able to satisfy that just by eating certain foods,
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=12s)** — especially vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, and even vitamin B3, which is called niacin.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=18s)** — And with all that chemistry going on, your body needs roughly about 180 nutrients
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=24s)** — to allow that biochemistry to work.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=26s)** — And it's actually very difficult to determine if someone's deficient in a nutrient by just
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=31s)** — checking the blood because a lot of these nutrients are deep in yourselves.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=36s)** — A big reason why vitamins might not work in your body is that you might not have
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=40s)** — enough acid in your stomach. You can't absorb certain things like minerals.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=45s)** — You're going to have a hard time breaking down things with B12 because B12 is usually in meat
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=51s)** — and that's locked up with protein. And if there's not enough acid to break down the
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=55s)** — protein, you don't get absorption of B12. One big clue to know that you don't have
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=60s)** — enough stomach acid is if you have indigestion, heartburn, too much bacteria in your small
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=65s)** — intestine. The problem with synthetics is they don't get absorbed like natural ones.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=70s)** — The next point I want to bring up is when you take a vitamin or a mineral as an isolated
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=75s)** — nutrient, this is very unnatural. It's going to create a problem because in nature,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=80s)** — you never see an isolated nutrient. If you take too much vitamin D, especially in higher amounts,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=86s)** — you'll end up with a magnesium deficiency. It's important to know that a lot of these
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=91s)** — nutrients come in more of a kind of a complex with other nutrients. The other topic I'm going
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=96s)** — to talk about is the form of nutrition. For example, folic acid. You don't want to take
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=101s)** — the synthetic version. Anytime you take vitamin B9, you want to take that in the active
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=106s)** — form. The folate. The same thing that goes with vitamin B12. You don't want to take the synthetic
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=112s)** — version called cyanocobalamin. Instead, you want to take methylcobalamin. Why? Because you want
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=119s)** — to get results. You want something to work better. The next point I want to bring up is
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=123s)** — thinking you're taking a vitamin like vitamin A, but it's not really... it's the precursor
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=128s)** — to vitamin A. Not retinol. When people say, just eat a lot of carrots or spinach,
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=133s)** — you couldn't eat the volume of that food to get this very important active version of vitamin A.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=139s)** — Retinol. The way to get retinol is from egg yolks or cod liver oil. Not a supplement. The
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=145s)** — same thing that goes with omega-3 fatty acids. People have this idea that if you eat
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=149s)** — walnuts or flaxseed, you're getting your omega-3. It's not true because the active form
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=156s)** — of omega-3 is EPA in DHA. And you can get that from like fish oil, cod liver oil.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=163s)** — Next point is a lot of vitamins have fillers with maltodextrin, which is a starch. And they
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=170s)** — use maltodextrin as a spray agent to turn things into a powder. The problem with
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=175s)** — maltodextrin is it can compete for certain nutrients like vitamin C. You also have the
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=186s)** — break down sugar and refined carbs. And so when you're taking maltodextrin or sugar or starch,
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=192s)** — the need for B1 goes way, way, way higher. Next point, trying to get results from a vitamin
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=199s)** — or a mineral while at the same time you're eating junk or your diet sucks. Don't think that
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=205s)** — vitamins are going to work to compensate for a bad diet. And that leads us to the next
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=209s)** — problem with nutrition. If you are a diabetic or pre-diabetic or have insulin resistance,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=215s)** — your ability to absorb nutrients is going to be a lot less. You want to fix the insulin
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=220s)** — resistance first or the diabetes by going on a low carb diet. And as another side point to that,
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=226s)** — if you're a smoker, if you drink a lot of alcohol, that's going to kind of nullify the
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=231s)** — nutrient results. Unless you're giving up smoking or drinking, then it's very important
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=235s)** — to start taking nutrition. Realize that the absorption is going to be a lot less.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=239s)** — The next point I want to bring up is when you read the label on the back of your
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=243s)** — and the first one says calcium carbonate, you're basically taking limestone. Anything that's listed
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=250s)** — as the first ingredient is usually the majority of what's in that bottle. That's why when you
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=256s)** — take these multivitamins and they're so heavy, it's like a paperweight. When you take
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=260s)** — calcium at the same time as you're taking magnesium, they can cancel each other out
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=266s)** — because they both compete for absorption. The next point I want to talk about is taking enough
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=271s)** — of certain nutrients. The one that I'm talking about mainly is vitamin D. The RDAs for vitamin
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=278s)** — D3 are like 600 IUs. It's ridiculous. They did not calculate the information correctly from
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=285s)** — 10 research studies when they came up with this 600 IUs. And I talked to a pioneer in vitamin D
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=293s)** — research and this person said that this wasn't an error. It was an intentional thing that
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=298s)** — did to make it sound possibly toxic. I mean think about it. 10,000 international units of
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=304s)** — vitamin D3 sounds very very scary when in fact it's only like being out in the sun for 20
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=310s)** — to 30 minutes. It was found that this so-called error with vitamin D3, I'm talking
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=316s)** — about 600 international units, should have been calculated at 8,895 international units.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=326s)** — If you corrected the confusion that they had from all of these studies. If you're taking 600
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=332s)** — and you don't feel any difference, you know why. Now this especially relates to the next point
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=337s)** — I want to bring up. If you have a health problem, let's say for example you have some
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=342s)** — chronic illness or diabetes or whatever, small amounts of any vitamin are not going to create
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=348s)** — the change. You need therapeutic doses especially with vitamin D, magnesium and other
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=354s)** — Like for example if you had peripheral neuropathy, the bottom of your feet was numb, tingly because
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=361s)** — of your diabetic and those nerves are literally dying. If you took tiny amounts of vitamins,
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=366s)** — especially like vitamin B1, it's not going to create any difference. To fix peripheral neuropathy
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=371s)** — from a diabetic situation, you need a special type of B1 that is fat-siable. It's called
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=378s)** — botamine and in larger amounts to create an effect. Anytime you're trying to create a
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=384s)** — therapeutic effect, you're going to need larger amounts of the nutrient. And like I said before,
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=389s)** — it's going to be very difficult to get that from your diet. You're going to have to use
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=393s)** — supplements. And this also relates to potassium. If you're looking for a potassium
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=397s)** — supplement, if the milligram dosage was 99 milligrams, you'd have to take over 47 of those
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=405s)** — capsules to get just the daily dosage of your potassium. So again, if you're taking potassium
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=411s)** — and you're just taking one of those a day, don't expect any change. I hope I shed some light on
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=417s)** — why vitamins might not be working for you and gave you some knowledge on what to do
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=422s)** — to get your vitamins to work better. Now I have another similar related topic on mistakes
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYwWTn2MPYo&t=427s)** — people make with vitamins and you should check that one out. I put it up right here.
