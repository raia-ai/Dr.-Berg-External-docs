- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=0s)** — Now, out of all the things that can affect your state of well-being and your health,
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=4s)** — sleep is at the top of the list. And people don't even appreciate a good night's sleep until they
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=9s)** — don't sleep. There was a period of my life, actually 12 years, where I had terrible,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=15s)** — terrible sleep. There were nights where I didn't even sleep one minute. So I really appreciate
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=19s)** — sleep. And I have 12 things today I'm going to share with you about sleep based on first-hand
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=25s)** — There is a direct correlation with your sleep and your overall heart function and your longevity.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=33s)** — And if you don't sleep, it can affect your cravings. You can actually develop an alteration
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=39s)** — in your blood sugars from just not sleeping that well. Your appetite will increase,
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=44s)** — your cortisol will increase, your mood will go down if you don't get enough sleep. But boy,
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=48s)** — when you sleep good, everything is great. So the first thing we're talking about is cortisol.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=53s)** — Cortisol is an adrenal hormone and that can keep you up at night, especially around
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=59s)** — 2 to 2 30 in the middle of the night. You want to take more vitamin B1. Make sure it's
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=66s)** — a natural version, but it can actually greatly reduce your cortisol. You want to put a lot
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=70s)** — of attention on long walks every day, just to kind of get rid of this stress. Because
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=75s)** — obviously stress is activating the cortisol release. So you want to do a lot of things to
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=81s)** — focus in on what's really underneath the stress. Is it that you're watching too many
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=86s)** — YouTube videos on the news and bad news? And that can play a huge role. And I know
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=91s)** — people want to be informed of what's going on, but you have to limit or curb how much
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=97s)** — of that you can take during the given day. The second really important thing about sleep
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=101s)** — is getting enough vitamin D. If you don't have enough vitamin D, your circadian waves
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=106s)** — won't work that well. If you get jet lag, for example, vitamin D is the greatest antidote
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=112s)** — to jet lag. It can quickly reset your circadian rhythms pretty quick within a day or two.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=118s)** — You kind of need a lot. You need between 40,000 to 50,000 IUs of vitamin D3. But
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=123s)** — vitamin D, even taken right before bed, sometimes can greatly help you sleep. Especially
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=129s)** — if you have sleep apnea. All right, the next thing, and that is calcium. If you're
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=134s)** — trying to go to bed at night and your muscles are kind of crampy and things, it could be
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=138s)** — magnesium, which I will cover, but it could also be a calcium deficiency. So calcium is
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=143s)** — involved with the muscles. But also a calcium deficiency will cause you to be tired. I don't
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=150s)** — know if you've ever been really, really exhausted and so tired that you can't sleep.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=155s)** — Well, calcium is the remedy for that. There's a couple ways you can get the calcium. One is
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=159s)** — with a calcium supplement, maybe a calcium magnesium supplement, maybe calcium lactate,
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=165s)** — which is a good one. Another thing you can do is consume more cheese during the day. Make sure
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=170s)** — it's a high quality cheese. I like European cheese, especially if it's raw. Let's talk
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=174s)** — about milk for a second. Is milk okay? Well, if you can find some raw milk, that would be
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=179s)** — the ideal situation right before bed. There is also something called nighttime milk, and you
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=191s)** — can get it when you milk cows at night, which enhances your tryptophan in the milk
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=197s)** — and the melatonin in the milk. But if you really can't find that, there's something else
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=201s)** — that I would recommend. Kefir, like from goat's milk before bed, plain, seems to work good.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=209s)** — And if you're concerned about it breaking your keto or your fasting, just take it right
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=214s)** — after the meal. That can give you some probiotics, which will help your sleep,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=218s)** — as well as the calcium. And also what's in milk is high levels of tryptophan, which turn into
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=226s)** — serotonin and melatonin, which can help you sleep. And so now let's talk about magnesium.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=231s)** — Magnesium will help reduce that cortisol too. It'll help relax you, especially before bed.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=239s)** — It can help with muscle cramps, which can keep you up. Some people take like a hot bath
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=244s)** — with Epsom salts, which is magnesium sulfate. That's another tip with magnesium. And there's
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=250s)** — other types of magnesium massage oils that you can have someone work on your back and muscles
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=255s)** — that are tight. The next thing on the list is making sure you have enough potassium in your
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=259s)** — diet. Potassium is kind of like a physiological tranquilizer. It calms the nervous system.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=268s)** — A lot of the potassium is used in your muscles and your nervous system. And so if
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=272s)** — you're deficient, you may notice that your muscles are not relaxing properly. And your heart,
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=278s)** — you might have palpitations or an arrhythmia, which can keep you up, as well as a higher pulse
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=283s)** — rate. So potassium is key in keeping your pulse rate lowered. And if you ever consumed a lot
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=290s)** — of refined carbs or sugar, you're going to notice that you end up with a potassium
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=294s)** — deficiency. It can even create this like pounding sensation in your inner ear right
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=299s)** — before sleep. That means you need more potassium. And the way you can get more potassium and
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=304s)** — magnesium is through eating more leafy greens in your diet. I normally have between seven and
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=311s)** — ten cups. So if you can work up to like seven cups of salad per day, that will give you
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=316s)** — your potassium and magnesium requirements. Potassium is also really good to help lower
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=322s)** — anxiety. So if your diet is like really heavy with meat, which is kind of stimulating,
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=328s)** — and you don't have the offsetting minerals like magnesium and calcium from the greens,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=333s)** — you may find that your nervous system is more accelerated and you don't have the break pads
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=338s)** — that magnesium and potassium provide. Now let's talk about your environment in your room. You
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=344s)** — have your pillow, you have your mattress. If your pillow is not the right the height of
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=350s)** — your head, so your head's too low or too high, that can be an issue. So it's really
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=355s)** — worth investing in a good quality pillow, not a cheap pillow that can hurt your neck,
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=362s)** — as well as a good mattress because you basically spend one third of your life in bed. I suggest
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=367s)** — go to a mattress store and test things out and see what you like best. And also you have
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=372s)** — the room, right? If your room is like in the winter and it's cold outside, you can't keep
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=377s)** — the window open, so you don't get as much oxygen. You might have too much CO2. And if
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=384s)** — you have too much CO2 and not enough oxygen, that alone can keep you up. But you can simply
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=389s)** — just get a couple plants in your room to help reverse that. But I always sleep better with the
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=394s)** — window open if possible. And also with your temperature, people tend to sleep better if
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=400s)** — the room is a bit cooler. So I keep the temperature in my room about 68 and then I
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=406s)** — seem to sleep better. Now what about taking melatonin? Is that a good thing? I don't
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=409s)** — recommend it because melatonin helps you get the sleep. It doesn't help you stay asleep.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=416s)** — And melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland. And anytime you take melatonin,
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=421s)** — potentially it could create a problem with the gland that's supposed to make it. So instead,
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=427s)** — you can increase your melatonin through foods as well as through light. The sun,
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=434s)** — over 50% of the sun's rays are infrared, which will naturally increase melatonin inside your
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=442s)** — body, believe it or not. And this melatonin has a different function to the with the pineal
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=447s)** — crates. Melatonin is a very potent antioxidant. And I will put a video on that down below.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=454s)** — And so melatonin can be increased through this infrared, which actually can even penetrate
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=459s)** — your clothes. So especially like a sunrise or a sunset, you can get some really good
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=466s)** — infrared from that. And even like sitting in front of a fireplace or a candle or a campfire,
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=474s)** — or even having an infrared device. So you can see I have one right here. You can get one of
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=478s)** — these devices and to increase your infrared. And you can also use that for various other
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=483s)** — things like controlling pain and inflammation. And the other thing to know about that topic
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=487s)** — is that if you have fluorescent lighting, or you're in front of your
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=492s)** — screens a lot, or your cell phone, or the TV, all of that puts out this blue light,
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=499s)** — which interferes with your sleep cycles. Not to mention the other thing that's involved
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=503s)** — with the cell phone in the computer screens. That's called EMF, electromagnetic fields. Boy,
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=511s)** — that can really affect your ability to sleep, especially if you're doing that right before
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=515s)** — bed, or you spend a lot of time on it, or there's some type of device close to your head while
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=520s)** — you're sleeping. The next thing I want to talk about is vitamin B12. B12 is really good to
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=525s)** — help prevent things like sleep apnea. B12 is also involved in the creation of melatonin. And
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=531s)** — so if you're deficient in B12, for various reasons, that can keep you up as well. The
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=537s)** — next nutrient is vitamin B1. Vitamin B1 specifically helps that brain chatter,
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=542s)** — that excessive thinking before bed. And I recommend getting a natural one, because a B1
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=548s)** — deficiency is so common with so many people. And if you haven't ever experimented with it,
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=554s)** — taking it when you have anxiety or nervous tension, within minutes, you just feel calm
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=560s)** — and relaxed, and you can drift off into a wonderful sleep. B1 is essential for the brain
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=566s)** — stem function, which has a lot to do with your breathing. And you may find that your
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=572s)** — especially at night, if you don't have enough B1. So you might catch yourself like breathing
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=578s)** — very shallow. And what causes a B1 deficiency is the stress, sugar, refined carbs, and drinking
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=585s)** — too much coffee or tea. B1 is also really good to remedy nightmares. And that brings us to
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=592s)** — the next part of this, which is carbs, right? If you're consuming a lot of carbs, if you're
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=597s)** — consuming a lot of sugar or alcohol, you're going to deplete your B1. And that's going to
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=603s)** — increase what's called the fight or flight mechanism or the sympathetic nervous system,
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=607s)** — which is going to keep you up at night, not just with cortisol, but with adrenaline. Try
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=612s)** — to sleep if you're being chased by a tiger. It doesn't work. So the more carbs and more
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=617s)** — sugars, the more insulin resistance that you develop. And guess what else happens when you
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=623s)** — insulin resistance? You start having frequent urination at night. So all these people that
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=628s)** — have to get up through the night, and some people I know it's like 12 times a night. It's
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=633s)** — crazy. What they need to do is fix insulin resistance because insulin resistance, as well
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=639s)** — as pre-diabetes and diabetes, causes a situation where you have this excessive urine at night
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=647s)** — that will just force you to get out of bed. And it's so easy to fix that if you just change
- **[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=654s)** — your diet. Another nutrient to help you sleep is zinc. Zinc tends to be intimately involved in
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=661s)** — the circadian rhythms and the REM sleep, as well as increasing tryptophan, which turns in the
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=667s)** — serotonin and then melatonin. So sometimes taking zinc before bed can greatly help your
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=680s)** — If you're consuming caffeine, boy, that'll keep you up. So I would really look at that as well. I
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=686s)** — have just a very small cup of coffee in the mornings and that's it. I don't have any more.
- **[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=690s)** — And I find if I do that, I can sleep really good. Your liver has to detoxify that caffeine.
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=696s)** — And if you have any problem with your liver, then you might just tend to retain that
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=701s)** — longer than you should. I always focus on my breathing to help me get to sleep. And also,
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=707s)** — if I get up in the middle of the night and I can't get back to sleep, I notice that I'm
- **[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=711s)** — catching my breath. So slow, even breaths, making sure that your inhalation equals the
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=718s)** — exhalation. Breathing through your nose, breathing through your stomach, focusing on
- **[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=723s)** — the breath can greatly help you sleep. And the last point is not eating too late or overeating
- **[12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=729s)** — because if your digestion is stressed or you're bloated, you will not be able to sleep. So try
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=734s)** — to have that last meal as early as possible. And especially if you have insomnia, you may just find
- **[12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=741s)** — that can create a huge difference. Now, because of the censoring and the suppressing of the
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=746s)** — algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's
- **[12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInAKJTTtYE&t=751s)** — a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately. So to make sure you have full
