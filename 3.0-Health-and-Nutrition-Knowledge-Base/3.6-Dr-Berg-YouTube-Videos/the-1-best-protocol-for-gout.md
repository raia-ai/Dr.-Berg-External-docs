- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to give you a really good, effective protocol for gout. And so the question
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=5s)** — that I get a lot of times with remedies is like, if it's so effective, why don't
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=9s)** — doctors recommend it? Well, because it's not medical care. There's not a lot of money in
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=15s)** — these natural remedies. You can't actually patent some of these remedies. Well, actually,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=19s)** — that's not true because I find a lot of great protocols from patents, which in this case,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=25s)** — I'm going to put a link down below with a patent on a certain combination, but we're not using the
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=30s)** — whole combination. We're using something very specific to help with gout. So why am I doing
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=35s)** — this video? What's wrong with the current medical treatment for gout? Well, the medication
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=40s)** — that they recommend has side effects, whereas natural remedies have much less side effects,
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=46s)** — if any. And so let's just dive right in. So what is gout? Gout is a situation where
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=50s)** — you have a buildup of uric acid, and for some reason it's building up crystals in certain
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=55s)** — places in your body. Primarily it's in the big toe, but it can be in other places as well.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=62s)** — They've determined that almost 24% of the cases is genetic related, but even if you
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=67s)** — have a genetic propensity to get gout, there's still things you can do. We're going to use a
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=73s)** — strategy. Okay, we want to use natural remedies, things that will help excrete uric acid. And
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=79s)** — also want things that will help get rid of pain directly if there's a gout attack. Now,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=86s)** — alipurinol, the main medication for gout, works by inhibiting an enzyme. It's called xanthine
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=92s)** — oxidase. So this medication inhibits that enzyme. But I want to give you some natural
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=98s)** — inhibitors that have virtually no side effects. The other thing to talk about is your diet.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=104s)** — If you look up gout, they're going to have you recommend a lot of different foods,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=108s)** — especially proteins. But I found that if you eliminate sugar, especially fructose,
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=115s)** — and of course, alcohol, especially beer, you're going to be a lot more successful.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=120s)** — And generally speaking, there's two things that can be done to reduce the intensity of gout.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=127s)** — Number one is just drinking more water to dilute the concentration of uric acid. And
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=132s)** — two, raising the pH of your urine. You'll have less precipitation of this uric acid forming
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=140s)** — in the joints. One more really important point I want to mention. This protocol I'm going to
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=145s)** — give you, I would recommend to do it for at least two to three weeks. Number one is called
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=152s)** — white Chinese mulberry extract. There's some great research on this. And all the research,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=159s)** — I'm just going to put links down below. Well, this remedy, mulberry, has a certain
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=163s)** — phytonutrient that can inhibit that enzyme that forms uric acid. The next recommendation
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=169s)** — is Chinese cinnamon. The scientific name is called cinnamomum cassia. And you can probably
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=177s)** — find this in a powder or a capsule. Chinese cinnamon has some fascinating principles. It's
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=189s)** — other additional properties to help with blood sugars and insulin resistance.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=195s)** — And so it can help you in various ways. Diabetics, for example, or people that are
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=200s)** — pre-diabetic or have insulin resistance, have a much greater risk of getting gout than
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=206s)** — people that don't. And the third would be omega-3 fatty acids. And yes, you can use
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=211s)** — fish oils. I recommend cod liver oil because it adds two additional things, vitamin A and
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=216s)** — vitamin D. Vitamin A is good for your kidneys. And vitamin D is also good as a natural
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=222s)** — anti-inflammatory. But there's some interesting research that shows that when you take omega-3
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=227s)** — in sufficient quantities, it can act as an anti-inflammatory, but it can also inhibit
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=233s)** — the enzyme that forms uric acid. All right, so the next remedy, and this is specifically
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=237s)** — to help excrete excessive amounts of uric acid, I would recommend alpha-lipoic acid.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=245s)** — Alpha-lipoic acid is also beneficial for peripheral neuropathy if you're a diabetic
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=252s)** — and you have nerve pain, but it can help get rid of uric acid. And as a side note,
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=258s)** — there's many theories about why people get gout. I think what happens with people with gout,
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=265s)** — their kidney just has a very difficult time getting rid of uric acid. So the more you
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=275s)** — function, you're going to have much less gout. But with gout patients,
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=281s)** — they're just reabsorbing a lot more uric acid than they should. The last two remedies
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=286s)** — are mainly for gout attacks. So the first remedy is devil's claw. Another name for this
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=294s)** — would be cat's claw because the flowers look like a claw. But devil's claw is in one study
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=301s)** — just as effective as Vioxx, which they took off the market. But it's a very potent anti-inflammatory.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=308s)** — And so you can take it to get rid of really any type of pain, arthritis pain, but definitely
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=314s)** — gout pain. And the last remedy is from the Brazilian rainforest. It's called ipo-ruru. And
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=320s)** — this herb is also another potent anti-inflammatory. And it can act as a COX-2 inhibitor. So
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=328s)** — that's how aspirin works. And when someone has gout, a lot of times they're recommended
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=333s)** — aspirin or other types of NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. But this remedy from the
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=341s)** — Brazil rainforest can act as a natural NSAID to help decrease pain. Now, the last point
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=347s)** — I want to bring up, there's some great data on your microbes in your gut helping you break
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=352s)** — down this uric acid. And so one thing I would add to your diet to help bring up certain microbes,
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=359s)** — to help you fight this, would be eating certain foods that are more probiotic, like the
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=365s)** — sauerkraut, the kimchi. I would highly recommend doing that as well as consuming enough good
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=370s)** — salad that's healthy, that can feed the microbes, because there's some additional data
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=375s)** — that when the microbes eat this fiber, they make something called a small chain fatty acid
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=382s)** — called butyrate, which is also great for gout. Now before you go, to get more information on how
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VkP4tqGhdY&t=388s)** — to alkalize your urine, I created this video for you and I'll put it up right here. Check it out.
