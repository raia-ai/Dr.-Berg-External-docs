- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=0s)** — You know, you've been lied to about your food for a very long time.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=4s)** — You see this right here? This is a 450 milligram tablet.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=9s)** — What if I were to tell you that this is actually zero milligrams?
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=13s)** — Of course, you're looking at it, but it really doesn't exist.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=15s)** — These aren't the droids you're looking for.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=17s)** — What would you say? I'm crazy, right?
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=19s)** — Well, this is a loophole that manufacture companies use
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=23s)** — to hide ingredients in your food. And it's called the rounding rule.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=28s)** — If something is less than 500 milligrams per serving size,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=33s)** — they don't have to list it in the nutrition facts.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=35s)** — Let me explain. Let's say a product has less than 500 milligrams of trans fats per serving size.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=42s)** — Manufacturing companies can round down to zero and even say on the label that it has zero trans fats.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=49s)** — The same thing with MSG. It's called the rounding down trick.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=53s)** — And it blows my mind how they got away with getting that passed
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=56s)** — because 500 milligrams is not zero.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=60s)** — You see, if something says sugar-free, fat-free, sodium-free,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=64s)** — the chances of you reading the ingredients are pretty slim.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=66s)** — So this is just another reason why you need to start reading the ingredients.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=70s)** — And unfortunately, when we talk about sugar, there could be a lot of different terms for sugar.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=73s)** — There's actually over 200 different words for sugar.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=75s)** — But the thing that really kind of gets me is something called incidental additives.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=81s)** — Ingredients that have a different function that's not related to
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=86s)** — texture, flavor, or preservative.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=89s)** — Or they have a function of extracting certain things from food.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=93s)** — They're called solvents.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=95s)** — If that ingredient is less than 5% of the finished product,
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=100s)** — they don't have to declare it on the label.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=103s)** — Now this could be dextrin, which is a carbohydrate, but it acts more like a sugar.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=108s)** — On the glycemic index, maltodextrin can go up to 180.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=114s)** — Table sugar is like 74.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=117s)** — So even though it's classified as a complex carbohydrate, it acts way more like a sugar.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=121s)** — Sometimes maltodextrin is just a filler.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=123s)** — So a lot of vitamins have this hidden maltodextrin and you have no idea if it's in there.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=128s)** — At the end of this video, I will explain how to identify maltodextrin.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=132s)** — But I think the most dangerous thing that's hidden in your food is hexane.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=138s)** — There's hexane residues in MetRx.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=142s)** — There's also hexane residues in the KineBars.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=145s)** — Now what's going on with hexane?
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=146s)** — Well, hexane is a solvent.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=149s)** — And so these products I just mentioned involve soy protein isolates.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=153s)** — This is a very common protein that they put in bars, veggie burgers, plant-based products.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=159s)** — And they use this hexane to extract certain things from the soybean.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=163s)** — And so they bathe these soybeans in a petrochemical bath of this solvent,
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=167s)** — hexane, which is the byproduct of gasoline refining.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=170s)** — There's a few companies that got sued because they advertise them as all-natural.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=175s)** — Clif Bars was sued for this.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=177s)** — And so was Kashi, who is owned by Kellogg's.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=180s)** — Because you can't have hexane in an all-natural product,
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=183s)** — especially if something is certified 100% organic.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=186s)** — But hexane is classified as a neurotoxin by the CDC and as hazardous air pollution by the EPA.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=194s)** — Of course, the soybean industry will argue that,
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=197s)** — oh yeah, hexane can get evaporated, blah, blah, blah.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=199s)** — There's no regulatory body that's measuring how much hexane
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=203s)** — we're getting when we're eating these foods.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=204s)** — They might think that they're getting this clean product,
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=207s)** — but they're not getting a clean product.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=209s)** — And so how these manufacturing companies use this as an exemption is they classify them as
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=214s)** — a processing aid.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=216s)** — And like I said before, it could be like an anti-caking agent,
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=219s)** — but it can also be a binder.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=221s)** — And also a lot of the artificial sweeteners have in them hidden amounts of actual sugar
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=226s)** — and maltodextrin and dextrose, which is a synthetic sugar.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=231s)** — But because they're smaller amounts, they don't have to list them.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=234s)** — This is why it's probably good to actually get one of those blood sugar monitoring devices
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=238s)** — so you can test your blood sugar after consuming some of these products.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=242s)** — Like one that I would really want to test would be this one bar here.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=246s)** — First of all, it says 20 grams of protein, one gram of sugar,
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=250s)** — but it has isomaltoligosaccharides.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=256s)** — It's classified as a fiber, but it acts just like a sugar.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=260s)** — The other thing you have to be careful about is when they say no added sugars, right?
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=263s)** — In your mind, you're going to feel better about it like,
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=265s)** — wow, good, there's no added sugars.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=267s)** — But when you read the ingredients, you're going to see that there might not be added sugars,
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=271s)** — but the stuff in there definitely is filled with sugars.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=274s)** — And you also have to be careful about anything that says sugar-free or sugar-free gum.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=278s)** — But because the serving size is so small, they can use it to trick you.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=282s)** — I'm also suspect of anything that says sugar-free when the carbs are high as well.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=287s)** — Another trick that they use with multidextrin is multidextrin is classified as a carbohydrate,
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=293s)** — not as a sugar, even though it acts more like a sugar.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=295s)** — And so they can get away with saying it's sugar-free.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=298s)** — Again, if you check your blood, it'll just jack your blood sugar way the heck up there.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=301s)** — Another ingredient I would be very careful about is corn syrup solids.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=307s)** — Like, wait a second, corn syrup solids?
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=309s)** — Corn syrup solids is basically a solid form of corn syrup.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=314s)** — So it's the same thing, but it's just in a solid form.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=317s)** — So it's a synthetic type of sugar made out of corn.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=320s)** — Besides gum being in a small quantity, and they can kind of hide a lot of things in there,
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=325s)** — you also have the sugar-free non-dairy creamers you put in your coffee.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=329s)** — I know when I'm at a town in a hotel, right, there's always this coffee machine and
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=334s)** — they always have this non-refrigerated non-dairy creamer.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=338s)** — Sometimes it says sugar-free. I will not use that in my coffee.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=341s)** — Even though I need cream in my coffee, I will just drink it black because I don't trust those
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=345s)** — creamers. So I have a question for you.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=347s)** — What's your thoughts on this 450-milligram capsule really being zero?
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=353s)** — So now let me show you a great simple way to detect if something has
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=358s)** — hidden starches in it, like maltodextrin, cornstarch, or foodstarch.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=363s)** — Check this out.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=363s)** — This test is to determine if there are carbohydrates in your supplements
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=368s)** — or even your food. And primarily I'm going to focus on maltodextrin, especially in flavors.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=374s)** — Now, the works like this. All you need is some iodine.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=377s)** — If you combine iodine with the starch, it turns the color blue.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=381s)** — Now, if we take just normal water, I'm just going to take water.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=385s)** — We just take a drop or two of iodine in just regular water, tap water.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=391s)** — You can see it doesn't turn blue. It stays kind of gold and yellow.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=395s)** — But if we take some iodine on some wonderful bread, you can see it will turn it blue.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=400s)** — Okay, that's the chemical reaction. Now, if we take pure maltodextrin,
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=404s)** — for example, and put it in some water right here, mix it up,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=408s)** — put a couple drops of iodine in it, you can see the color blue or purple.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=414s)** — Okay, that's pure maltodextrin.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=416s)** — Now, let's take this other electrolyte powder, which is a competitor's brand.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=421s)** — Which has a very similar formula to mine, like a copycat formula.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=425s)** — They state that this is without sugar or maltodextrin.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=428s)** — Add a scoop of that and a couple drops of iodine.
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=433s)** — Let's see if it has maltodextrin in there.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=438s)** — Whoa! Turns purple blue. Apparently it does.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=441s)** — All right, now let's take my electrolyte powder.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=442s)** — Let's see if it has any maltodextrin in there or carbs, starches, I mean.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=446s)** — Okay, mix it here. Let's put a couple drops of iodine in there.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=452s)** — No purple, no maltodextrin.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=454s)** — In fact, let's put some even more iodine in there.
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=457s)** — See if it eventually turns it purple.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=460s)** — And the answer is no. It stays yellow gold.
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=463s)** — And you can detect hidden maltodextrin
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI5a45kmvr0&t=465s)** — and other starches in your supplements and food.
