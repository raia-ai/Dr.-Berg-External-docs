- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=0s)** — I'm going to show you exactly what to do to no longer have cold feet or cold hands.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=6s)** — Typically, what do people mostly do? They wear maybe triple socks. They put their feet next to
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=11s)** — a heater every morning. They might use compression stockings. They maybe try to hydrate their body.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=17s)** — Or maybe they actually put cayenne pepper in their socks. But the problem is it might not
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=21s)** — last. This problem keeps coming back. And so when you research this topic, it kind of boils
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=27s)** — Maybe you have a thyroid problem. Maybe you have peripheral artery disease or circulation.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=34s)** — Or maybe Raynaud's phenomena where you have this circulatory problem where your extremities like
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=39s)** — your fingers or even your toes are blue because the body is not able to pump blood flow very
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=44s)** — effectively. Or maybe it's related to a nerve problem, a neuropathy because you're diabetic.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=51s)** — You might have what's called peripheral neuropathy. But what if you have none of
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=54s)** — problems? And your freaking feet are freezing all the time and your fingers are cold. What do you
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=60s)** — do? Today I'm going to give you a good solution. And as a side note, if you do have Raynaud's
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=65s)** — phenomena, usually that's an autonomic nervous system problem and responds to B1. I would
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=72s)** — recommend taking the fat soluble version, benfotamine, which can also, by the way,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=77s)** — help you if you have peripheral neuropathy. But that's just a side note. There's a really
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=82s)** — amazing, simple and expensive treatment to warm up your feet and hands. It involves exercising
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=90s)** — the arteries. The arteries have a muscle. It's a smooth muscle. And those muscles contract and
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=99s)** — relax. And that contraction is called vasoconstriction. And the relaxation is
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=103s)** — called vasodilation. So what I'm going to recommend is you exercise that system
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=108s)** — once or twice a day, only spending maybe a minute and a half to two minutes each day.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=115s)** — And this treatment actually increases the mitochondria in your blood vessels. It'll
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=120s)** — increase oxygen circulation and it'll really greatly help the autonomic nervous system.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=126s)** — So this is what you do. You take a bucket, maybe a five gallon bucket,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=130s)** — and fill about one third of it with ice and the rest with water. Okay, then you're going
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=138s)** — to stick your feet in it and your hands in it if your hands are cold. And you're going to
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=143s)** — wait for about one to two minutes when your feet and hands start to change and become
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=151s)** — slightly warmer. Now what's happening is you're creating a hermetic effect. You're adding
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=156s)** — a mild stress, which might seem like a major stress. And what's going to happen is your body's
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=162s)** — going to start to adapt and the temperature of your feet are going to start to warm up
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=168s)** — over time. Over maybe three to four or five days after doing this on a daily basis or even
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=175s)** — twice a day. And sometimes it might take a couple weeks. But this cold therapy, you would
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=180s)** — think that it just creates a vasoconstriction and gets rid of the blood flow, but you're
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=185s)** — actually creating a lot of communication into your feet and your hands. Also pushing out a lot
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=192s)** — of lactic acid and waste products. And you're going to actually be probably very surprised how
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=198s)** — this works. Now, some of you are going, there's no way in heck I'm going to do this. But
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=202s)** — all I'm saying is you just might want to try it. Try it for three days. And I think
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=207s)** — you're going to be quite shocked how this is going to help you. It's probably the only thing
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=211s)** — you haven't tried before. But it's going to work. Now, when I was in practice,
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=216s)** — a lot of the therapies and treatments that I did were totally opposite of what mainstream
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=222s)** — does. I mean, I had techniques like even for pain, like whether you have pain in your foot
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=229s)** — or your knee or a part of your body, people would come in, they would fly in from around
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=234s)** — the world for this chronic pain syndrome problem that no one was able to fix. And what would I do?
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=243s)** — So if they had a problem on the left side of their body, you know what I would do? I would
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=247s)** — work on the opposite side. I would work on the good side. And the results I got were
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=252s)** — unbelievable. If you haven't seen any of my videos on pain relief, you can do a search on
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=257s)** — that. But when I was in practice, boy, these techniques were just highly effective.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=261s)** — And people got results within a very short period of time. Whereas traditionally, and also the way
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=268s)** — I was taught is you do therapy on where you hurt. Well, the same thing applies to a lot of
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=273s)** — other things in healthcare. And especially if you have cold feet. I mean, the last thing that
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=279s)** — you would even imagine to do would be to add more cold to cold feet. The same thing with
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=285s)** — There's all sorts of high level athletes and Olympic athletes that train in low oxygen
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=292s)** — or high altitudes where there's thin air to add a stress to get their body to adapt to
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=298s)** — become stronger and more fit. I mean, I'll give you another example. I had one lady.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=304s)** — She was an opera singer. Okay. And she flew in from somewhere in the United States. It
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=310s)** — wasn't close by. She heard from a friend who told her from another friend that I got good
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=316s)** — results with laryngitis and hoarseness of the throat. She had this huge event that she had to
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=323s)** — sing and not being able to perform was a major, major problem because he was scheduled
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=329s)** — and like within a week. So she flew out to see me and she had this scratchy throat right
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=335s)** — the scratchy hoarseness throat. And what did I do? I did work on the opposite side in the back
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=343s)** — part of her neck and I have videos of how to do this. And I pretty much did this like
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=348s)** — through the day, like every two hours through like one or two days. By the end of the first
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=353s)** — day, it was probably 50% better. By the end of the second day, it was close to 80 to 90% better.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=360s)** — So all I'm saying is you should just try this technique to see if it works and then
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=365s)** — comment down below and then I'll go ahead and read the comments. I think you're going to
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=369s)** — find that it's very effective. Now since we're on the topic of circulation, if you do have
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=375s)** — peripheral neuropathy and you haven't watched this video, it might be a good idea. I put that
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaUspumK5ZU&t=380s)** — video up right here.
