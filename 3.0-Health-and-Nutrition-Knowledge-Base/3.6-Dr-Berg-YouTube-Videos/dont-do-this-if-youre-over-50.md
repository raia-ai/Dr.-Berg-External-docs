- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the number one best remedy for cataracts.
- **[00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=2s)** — Did you realize that one in four people over the age of 65 has a cataract?
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=7s)** — And by the time they reach 80 years old, one in two people will have a cataract.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=12s)** — 28,000 people a day worldwide develop cataracts.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=15s)** — Many people actually go blind because of it.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=17s)** — All it takes is a little bit of oxidative stress to the lens of the eye to start developing cataracts.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=24s)** — Oxidative stress is kind of like a rusting out of a tissue.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=27s)** — Normally in the lens of the eye you have this organized protein.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=31s)** — This protein is called crystalline.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=33s)** — It's one of the oldest proteins you have in your body because you developed it when you were in an embryo before you were actually born.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=40s)** — The problem with this protein is it never gets replaced like other tissues.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=43s)** — It's not like your liver that can regenerate.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=46s)** — Because once you start getting damage in the lens, that tissue does not replace.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=50s)** — So over time you have a lot of things that can damage the lens.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=53s)** — Something called glycation.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=54s)** — Glycation is where you have a sugar that connects with a protein and it gets stuck.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=60s)** — And now it becomes unusable to the body.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=63s)** — That protein becomes damaged.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=65s)** — This is why a lot of diabetics develop cataracts earlier than they should.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=70s)** — Of course as we age we also develop them.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=72s)** — Also steroids can really affect the eye.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=73s)** — If you're on prednisone for example.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=75s)** — Glycation for too much sugar or oxidation without having enough antioxidants built up in the lens of the eye.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=82s)** — The problem is the lens of the eye becomes kind of frosted.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=86s)** — Looking through a dirty lens where you can't quite see out of it.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=90s)** — Then people get surgery.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=91s)** — Not all surgeries can cure it and there are definitely complications.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=94s)** — There's a remedy or an antidote to cataracts that is very effective and it's very safe.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=100s)** — This video is on this book right here by a British medical doctor.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=104s)** — I'm going to summarize the book and then I'll put a link down below of the book.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=107s)** — So you can check it out if you want to get it.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=109s)** — In this book the doctor talks about several remedies or antidotes.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=113s)** — Some drug approaches like metformin and other diabetic medication which they have side effects.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=120s)** — But he also talks about some natural things that also work very well.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=124s)** — And one is a very specific form of carnosine.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=128s)** — Carnosine is a very unique compound that can be combined in a certain form.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=134s)** — That allows it to be transported through the eye and penetrate the lens.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=139s)** — It's a super potent antioxidant.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=142s)** — It has the potential to dissolve these damaged proteins in the eye.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=146s)** — Not to mention it actually activates your own antioxidants.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=150s)** — The solution is not to take it as a supplement but to take it in a drop form but not as carnosine.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=156s)** — Because if you just take straight carnosine in a drop and you put it in the eyes it won't work.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=161s)** — What you have to do is you have to combine it with a few things to allow it to be carried through the eye into the lens.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=169s)** — Because the lens is a little bit deeper into the eye.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=171s)** — You need carnosine in this form. N-acetyl-carnosine. N-A-C.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=176s)** — It can be transported through the eye and once it gets in the eye into the fluid around the lens
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=182s)** — then it breaks apart and allows the carnosine to do its magic.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=186s)** — During an experiment performed at the Moscow Hemholtz Research Institute of Eye Diseases
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=193s)** — scientists have used N-A-C eye drops 1% concentration on rabbits in the laboratory.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=200s)** — They compared this treatment with inactive eye drops.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=202s)** — N-A-C was able to reach the inner parts of the eye after about 15 to 30 minutes.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=207s)** — During this process N-A-C was broken down which is then free to work against glycation in the lens of the eye.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=213s)** — You also have a lot of membranes in there.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=215s)** — Carnosine can penetrate and navigate through the fat membranes and so it reaches deep into the cell.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=221s)** — During this experiment no side effects were reported.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=224s)** — The authors concluded that N-A-C is proposed as a treatment for eye disorders including
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=230s)** — cataracts, glaucoma, corneal disorders, inflammation and complications from diabetes.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=236s)** — Why would it improve complications of diabetes?
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=238s)** — Well, because diabetes increases your risk for cataracts.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=242s)** — The eye is one of the big targets for diabetes.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=245s)** — A group of scientists who performed in earlier rabbit experiments studied the effects of N-A-C drops on humans.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=251s)** — The scientists selected 49 volunteers with an average age of 65 years who had established age-related cataracts.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=258s)** — They then divided the patients into three groups.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=261s)** — Group 1 they treated with a 1% solution of N-A-C eye drops.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=265s)** — Group 2 was only treated with the placebo eye drops and group 3 was left untreated.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=269s)** — The patients were examined at 2 to 6 months intervals.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=273s)** — After 6 months approximately 41% of eyes treated with N-A-C presented a significant reduction in the clouding of the lens.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=284s)** — 90% of the treated eyes showed a gradual improvement of vision.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=288s)** — 89% of the eyes showed up to a 100% improvement of sensitivity to glare.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=295s)** — I mean just think about what they did.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=297s)** — They used a natural remedy with very little side effects if any
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=301s)** — to help get rid of cataracts.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=304s)** — Let me also answer two questions out of the book.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=306s)** — How long do I need to use the drops for a cataract?
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=309s)** — At least 3 to 5 months.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=311s)** — Because it's not an overnight thing. It's going to be a while before it actually corrects everything.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=316s)** — You're not using a toxic drug.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=317s)** — You're using something that's more natural and it's slowly dissolve some of these proteins that are damaging or clouding the eye.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=325s)** — In this video I'm not claiming that this natural remedy can cure anything.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=329s)** — I'm just giving you information to maybe take a look at it.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=333s)** — Another interesting thing about these NAC drops is that when you search for them on Amazon, you can't find them.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=339s)** — I mean it's weird because I did see it a long time ago, but now you can't find it.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=343s)** — You see a different type of NAC drops, but not the N-acetyl-carnosine drops.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=348s)** — However, I did find a couple sources where you can find these drops online, but not necessarily on Amazon.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=354s)** — And I will put those links down below.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=356s)** — What lessons can we learn from this video?
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=358s)** — The risk factors. Diabetes, consuming junk foods, steroids are all things that speed up the process of cataracts.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=366s)** — Cetols are the worst of the worst. I would avoid those.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=370s)** — Antioxidants can protect you against cataracts.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=373s)** — And I'm talking about onion, for example, is a good antioxidant.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=376s)** — Egg yolks, leafy green vegetables, grass-fed red meat also can help you build up antioxidants to help fight these things.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=384s)** — Vitamin A is also really important in the eyes.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=386s)** — This is why how the oil is a good source of vitamin A.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=390s)** — And so is grass-fed liver.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=392s)** — And lastly, the B vitamins, specifically B6 and B2 and folate.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=398s)** — Very important for the eyes.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=399s)** — My goal is to give people alternative solutions that don't give you a lot of side effects that can work on a natural level,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=408s)** — yet also tell you how to get to the root cause.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNNDojIDto&t=411s)** — Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.
