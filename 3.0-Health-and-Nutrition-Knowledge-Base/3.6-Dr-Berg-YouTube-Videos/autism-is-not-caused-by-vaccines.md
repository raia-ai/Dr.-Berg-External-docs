- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=0s)** — Autism is not caused by vaccines. The science is settled. If you look it up on Wikipedia, it'll say,
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=5s)** — there is no known cause of autism. It's most likely genetic, possibly environmental. There's no known
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=11s)** — cure. But there's one thing that Wikipedia does emphasize over and over again. It's a myth that
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=16s)** — vaccines are a cause of autism. I have to give a disclaimer here because YouTube has policies.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=22s)** — If something conflicts with medical consensus, it's considered misinformation. However, YouTube
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=28s)** — does give you an exception to that. If you want to cover opposing viewpoints or your own opinions
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=34s)** — and you back it up with research, potentially they won't take the video down. I am not going
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=39s)** — to conclude for you. I'm just going to give you a series of pieces of information and you
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=45s)** — can make up your own mind. With all these controversial topics, there's always opposing
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=49s)** — viewpoints, right? Because you have like Dr. Paul Offit. He's an advocate for vaccines
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=55s)** — for children and he's a critic of the anti-vaccine movement. Then of course,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=59s)** — you have Anthony Fauci who also says that there's no evidence between autism and vaccines.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=64s)** — And then between 2010 and 2021, Fauci received 58 royalty payments directly from vaccine
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=72s)** — research. So there's two main things I'm going to talk about. Number one is the myth that
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=77s)** — autism comes from vaccines because it's been disproven and there's no research. I'm going
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=85s)** — autism. There's advocates that are telling us that a cure is even dangerous and autism is
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=92s)** — normal. Let's first talk about what we really know about autism. We know that there's a
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=96s)** — much higher level of inflammation in the brain with autism. And I'm going to put some links
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=101s)** — down below from the research done by Dr. Coenbrey, who's a neurologist. So the data
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=106s)** — that he found in autism is that there's chronic inflammation that's not related to
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=112s)** — a microbe or a pathogen. One study showed that 70% of autistic children had higher levels of
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=119s)** — autoimmune diseases, which is really interesting. But what's even more interesting about that,
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=124s)** — a vaccine given to a person does not create an adequate immune response unless you also add
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=131s)** — something to that vaccine. And that thing that's added to the vaccine is called an adjuvant.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=136s)** — Aluminum compounds are the most commonly used vaccine adjuvants. Research shows that aluminum
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=143s)** — is toxic on multiple levels. It is a neurotoxin. The neurotoxicity of aluminum typically manifests
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=150s)** — in learning, memory, concentration, and speech deficits. The question arises what makes
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=156s)** — the brain particularly susceptible to aluminum toxic impact. When you get an injection with
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=161s)** — adjuvant aluminum, it goes up into and it crosses the blood-brain barrier with the help of an
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=167s)** — immune cell triggered by repeated exposure of unexpectedly long persistence of aluminum
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=173s)** — adjuvants in the human body. Now that's all very interesting, but now I have to show you
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=178s)** — something on this page right here. What we're looking at on this page is from 1980 to 2023.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=186s)** — Okay, and we're looking at the autism rate in the United States. There's one in 10,000
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=191s)** — people in the U.S. The number of vaccine doses went up to 12, with aluminum exposure 4x more
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=197s)** — than 250, so we got a thousand micrograms. Ten years later, now we have one in 150 people
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=204s)** — getting autism. And at that time, we went up doubling from 12 to 24 number of vaccine doses
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=212s)** — by age six, with more than doubling the aluminum exposure to 2,500 micrograms of
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=220s)** — 23 years later in 2023. One in 36 kids are diagnosed with the most aggressive vaccine
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=227s)** — schedule in history with 49 vaccine doses by age six, with an aluminum toxicity exposure
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=234s)** — of 5,000 micrograms. Now, I'm not telling you what to conclude from this. I'm just giving you
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=241s)** — the data. The FDA Department of Health and Human Services requires limits on aluminum in
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=247s)** — parental feeding solutions that require warning labels about potential aluminum hazards,
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=253s)** — yet sets no safety limits or required warnings for aluminum in vaccines. I would love to ask
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=259s)** — some of these medical experts that are pro-vaccine to help me understand how 5,000
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=268s)** — micrograms are safe for a child under the age of six. The consequence of this view is
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=274s)** — reflected in the fact that a large number of vaccine trials use an aluminum adjuvant containing
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=282s)** — placebo or other aluminum containing vaccines as the control group. When you do an experiment,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=289s)** — a control group is a group that doesn't get the treatment. So that way you have something
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=293s)** — to compare it to, right? So guess what? In the studies using this adjuvant aluminum in
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=297s)** — vaccines, the control group that's not supposed to be getting the aluminum is getting the
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=302s)** — aluminum. So right there, that completely cancels out those studies that did that.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=306s)** — And also the data, when you look at countries that don't have such an aggressive vaccine
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=312s)** — schedule, do not have significant trending autistic diagnoses. Even in the Amish community,
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=318s)** — which is unvaccinated, they have extremely low diagnoses of autism. There are certain
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=324s)** — genes that could put a child more at risk for developing autism, no doubt. And so the
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=331s)** — combination of the aggressive vaccine schedule with the amount of aluminum in an individual
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=336s)** — that's vulnerable because their genetics are predisposed to having autism, that could be the
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=342s)** — perfect storm. I personally think that before anyone is given a vaccine, if they could look
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=346s)** — at their genetics to see if they're vulnerable, then they can have a better choice on who's
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=351s)** — more at risk than others. So I'm going to give you Dr. Kornberry's protocol. And then
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=355s)** — right after I give you Dr. Kornberry's protocol, I'm going to show you a clip of
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=360s)** — him speaking about this topic. So the number one thing that he'll give someone is vitamin D3
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=364s)** — in higher amounts, 10,000 IUs. High levels of vitamin D3 help to create a calming effect
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=371s)** — of an overactive immune system. We have a hypersensitive immune reaction in the brain,
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=378s)** — interrupting the normal function of the brain. So vitamin D, number two, propolis. This is
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=383s)** — something that related to what bees make. Propolis greatly helps regulate a dysfunctional
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=389s)** — system. And it's a very potent anti-inflammatory for the brain. But the third thing is probably
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=396s)** — the most important thing. And it's an oral silica supplement. And the one that Dr.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=401s)** — Kornberry recommends is called monomethyl-silentrol. And he'll give between 100 to 200 milligrams
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=408s)** — of the silica three times a day. And if the child also has hyperactivity, he will add to
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=415s)** — his protocol four grams of glycinate, which calms down the nervous system. Now he'll also
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=421s)** — make some adjustments on that. If the child is too sleepy during the day, he'll cut that
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=426s)** — down a little bit because it does make you very calm. And I'm going to recommend that you
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=430s)** — put your child on a low carb diet so then the brain can start increasing ketones. And
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=437s)** — I also think that will support the brain. But I'm not making any claims. This is all theory.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=441s)** — Go ahead and make up your own mind. But now check out this clip from Dr. Kornberry.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=446s)** — When you inject aluminum in vaccines, aluminum is not eliminated by the kidneys. It remains in
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=455s)** — our organism. It is within the immune cells and it enters the brain, carried by the immune
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=461s)** — cells. There is a lot of research by Christopher Huxley. And he has shown that
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=470s)** — in the brains of people who died, they had autism and they found high levels of
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=479s)** — aluminum in the brain tissue. They went to the University of Oxford in England and they
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=486s)** — got samples from the brains of patients that had autism when they died. And they
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=494s)** — could see in the microscope that there were lots of nanoparticles of aluminum.
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=500s)** — It's amazing to see the number of vaccines and how people just accept it as something
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=508s)** — being normal. I've been treating autism since 2014. I was in high doses of vitamin D.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=517s)** — In a way, autism is not an immune disorder. And in another way, it is also a manifestation
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=524s)** — of toxicity caused by this aluminum. It causes a lot of abnormal metabolic changes.
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=534s)** — Every now and then, I received patients, their children or adolescents, and I was
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=542s)** — amazed to see the number of children and adolescents that are depressed nowadays,
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=549s)** — committing suicide. And this is increasing in the same rate that autism is increasing.
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=557s)** — So at some point, I received here a MS patient and her daughter was 17 years old. The
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=567s)** — told me that when she was only four years old, she was so depressed that child had to take
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=576s)** — antidepressant drugs. And because that girl was born in 2006, when she was receiving lots of
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=584s)** — vaccines containing aluminum, I decided to give her silica. That substance binds to aluminum
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=591s)** — and both silica and aluminum are eliminated by the kidneys. And she came back
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=599s)** — a year later, and she said that her depression was almost gone. She said that she was 85%
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=609s)** — better. And her psychiatrist was decreasing the drugs that she was taking. The psychiatrist
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=617s)** — thought that maybe she was no longer needing all those medications. You see, this is a
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=626s)** — tip of a nice bird. I'm going to put all that information down below, but I really appreciate
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=631s)** — this interview. This has been very enlightening and I think this is going to help a lot of
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=635s)** — people. I really appreciate you sharing this information. It's been extremely valuable. Thank
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvh3m2pp1zc&t=641s)** — you. Thank you for the opportunity to pass that information. Absolutely.
