- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=0s)** — Grass-fed beef is the biggest scam on the planet. It's a complete lie.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=4s)** — What I'm going to share with you is going to piss you off.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=7s)** — Less than 1% of beef sold in the US is truly grass-fed.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=11s)** — This whole idea of grass-fed is just filled with loopholes all over the place.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=15s)** — In 2016, the USDA dropped the official definition of grass-fed.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=20s)** — All of the cows are grass-fed. It's the last 3-6 months where they're fed other things,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=25s)** — like grains and some other ingredients that I had no idea.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=28s)** — Over 99% of all the beef that people are buying is not fully grass-fed,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=33s)** — despite what it says on the label. There is a tremendous amount of beef sold to
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=38s)** — America from other countries. Then with a little bit of processing,
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=43s)** — like packaging the beef, it now becomes a product of the US.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=47s)** — In other words, this country of origin labeling rule was repealed, which means revoked,
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=53s)** — for both beef and pork. Here's just another example of a lack of transparency where,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=58s)** — well, at least if it's from America, it's probably healthier when it's actually not
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=62s)** — even coming from America. And by the way, as a side note, did you know that when you
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=66s)** — eat a burger from a fast food place, the number of cows that that hamburger comes from
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=71s)** — literally can be over a hundred different sources? Because they have this entire
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=75s)** — processing plant where they're getting meat from all over the place. What people need to
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=79s)** — realize is what we're talking about is a cow that's very sedentary, that is fatty.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=84s)** — And the reason why it's tender is because it has barely any collagen. And without
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=87s)** — it's very, very tender. People do like marbled meat that's tender, but what they don't want
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=93s)** — to know about is how that animal is raised. Because what I'm going to tell you now is
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=98s)** — literally going to make you fall off your chair. And it's what these animals actually eat.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=103s)** — You might think, wow, grains. Well, it's probably a bucket of whole grains,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=108s)** — pretty healthy. No, they actually feed these animals in the feedlot, something called DDGS.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=114s)** — And that stands for dried distillers grain with soluble, a.k.a. the waste product from making
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=122s)** — ethanol. They take dent corn, which is field corn. It's inedible. You can't eat it. What
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=126s)** — are they going to do with this GMO waste product filled with glyphosate? It's basically the
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=131s)** — toxic byproduct from making ethanol. And what I found out is because of the subsidies,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=139s)** — taxpayers contribution to this, the cost for one metric ton of this waste material that is fed to
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=146s)** — the animals is roughly $150. Now, do you see why they can make so much profit on this?
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=152s)** — Because what they're trying to do is they need to put on about 600 pounds of extra weight
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=157s)** — on that cow. And the only way they can do it is with something so cheap, $150 per metric
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=164s)** — ton. Crazy. So that's the base. And then they add a little fiber. They add limestone, some
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=170s)** — synthetic vitamins and minerals. And then they add something else called monicin. It's an
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=174s)** — antibiotic. Antibiotics are used on a regular basis in feedlots in the U.S. And the reason
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=180s)** — why they use these antibiotics is because it increases weight gain. Even your grass-fed beef
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=185s)** — has been given antibiotics. Unless it says on the label, no antibiotics. But that's not all.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=190s)** — They also add in the U.S. something called beta agonist. This is a medication that enhances
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=197s)** — the muscle growth to increase another 30 pounds of muscle. And it's something that mimics
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=203s)** — adrenaline. There's been some studies that show that that can actually increase anxiety
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=207s)** — in humans if you consume that food. So there's two types of feedlots. You have one that's
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=211s)** — closed, like indoor, and they have another one that's open. Let's talk about the one that's
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=216s)** — That animal, which is 1,500 pounds, only gets a space that is 24 square feet. If I were to ask
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=224s)** — you how much that is, you might have to measure it out. But let me just tell you,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=228s)** — a parking space that you drive your car into is 128 square feet. So let's compare that.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=234s)** — 20 to 24 square feet to 128 square feet. So basically, it's 1 6th of a parking place.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=242s)** — Not a parking lot, a parking space. So basically, you can fit six cows into one parking space.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=251s)** — That's what they live in for three to six months. They have to make them sedentary and
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=257s)** — to add all this cheap food to gain the massive weight. So that way you can make the meat
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=263s)** — marbled and have it very tender, aka a very sick animal. That's what you're eating. Now,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=268s)** — open space in the feedlot doesn't get that much more space. They get roughly about 150
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=273s)** — square feet, which is about the same size as a little bit more than that parking space that
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=278s)** — I just talked about. But again, not much space. So how do you find truly grass-fed beef? You
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=284s)** — need to look for this. 100% grass-fed. Because if it just says grass-fed, it doesn't
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=290s)** — mean anything. And I highly recommend you spend a little bit more for this higher quality
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=295s)** — of meat because that way you support the small farmer that seems to be
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYcVR7YBBQ&t=299s)** — squeezed out of this marketplace. Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.
