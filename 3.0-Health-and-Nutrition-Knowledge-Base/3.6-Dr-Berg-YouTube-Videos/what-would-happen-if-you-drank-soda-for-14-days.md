- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=0s)** — What would actually happen if you consumed celery juice for 7 days?
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=4s)** — Now there are 4 things in celery juice that are quite powerful, but most of the things that people
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=10s)** — talk about in celery juice are not the things that are contributing to your health. Okay, like,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=15s)** — first of all, it's 95% water. The nutrients in celery juice are not that high. I mean,
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=21s)** — it does have folate, which is B9, but that's only like 9%. And then people say, oh yeah,
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=26s)** — high in sodium. In one glass, like 16 ounces of celery juice, you're talking about 288 milligrams
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=32s)** — of sodium. That's one eighth of what you need every single day. But what is really amazing
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=37s)** — in celery juice? There are 4 natural chemicals called phytonutrients. And also there's a book
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=45s)** — that states that celery juice is the most powerful medicine of our time. So let's talk
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=52s)** — about why that can actually even be true. The medical medium talks about the benefit from the
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=58s)** — sodium cluster crystals. And I really couldn't find any data on that, but I have found a lot
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=63s)** — of data on these 4 phytonutrients that I'm going to share with you. So the first one is
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=67s)** — a long name, 3N-butyl phthalide. Here's what this chemical does. Repair after a stroke,
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=75s)** — reconstruct the microcirculation. It has certain neural regenerative properties and its
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=81s)** — antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis. Now what is apoptosis? It's basically when the cell
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=88s)** — commits suicide when it's damaged. Also it has a property of an antithrombosis, so it helps to
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=95s)** — prevent clotting. And then the second compound is called apigenin. And apigenin is one of the most
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=102s)** — researched and studied polyphenols. It's in parsley, it's in onion, it's in oranges,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=109s)** — it's in thyme, it's in basil, and it's definitely in celery juice. Normally in nature a plant uses
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=117s)** — apigenin to protect itself against UV radiation from the sun, as well as acting as an insecticide.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=124s)** — So it's a defense mechanism. But when we consume this compound in small amounts,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=130s)** — it creates an epigenetic effect that actually can benefit us. But apigenin is a good muscle
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=136s)** — relaxer. This is why when you consume celery juice you feel calm. If you have high blood
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=142s)** — pressure it tends to lower the blood pressure, you can sleep better, and it has anti-diabetic
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=149s)** — properties. It's even been used to help people with amnesia, which is interesting.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=154s)** — The third compound is called cumeric acid. This compound is anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=161s)** — anti-clotting, as well as supporting your blood sugars. It can also help with inflammation
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=167s)** — with arthritis. Then the last compound is called camphorol. Camphorol has anti-viral properties,
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=174s)** — anti-bacterial properties, anti-fungal properties, as well as being an anti-inflammatory
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=179s)** — in general. So is celery juice the most powerful medicine of our time? I don't know about
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=185s)** — that, but it's pretty awesome. This is what I recommend you do, and I just got done with
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=189s)** — I did this for seven days. I'll probably continue it. You buy celery, wash it off,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=195s)** — make sure it's organic, juice 16 ounces, drink it in the morning, an empty stomach. If you
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=202s)** — wanted to add something to it, don't add additional juices. Add a little lemon to it.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=207s)** — But the main benefits come from these four compounds. There could be other compounds that
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=211s)** — are creating all sorts of effects, but if you haven't tried it, you might want to try
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=215s)** — it. I think you might like it. If you haven't seen my other video on celery, I put that up
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DZUtY9AGA&t=219s)** — here. Check it out.
