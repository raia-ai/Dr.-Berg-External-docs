- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=0s)** — So if you have that loose, saggy skin underneath your arms,
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=4s)** — you're going to be very excited to watch this video.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=8s)** — Typically a person with loose skin underneath their arms
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=11s)** — might just think it's a fat problem and they just need to lose weight.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=15s)** — So they do all this cardio and they change their diet
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=19s)** — and it doesn't do anything. So what I have to share with you first is
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=23s)** — what the problem really is and from there
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=26s)** — we can come up with a really good solution. Now there's a term I want to
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=29s)** — introduce you to
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=30s)** — called sarcopenia, age-related
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=33s)** — muscle loss. And this may or may not be happening to you depending on your age.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=39s)** — And one other thing. Are you sitting down for this?
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=43s)** — Immobility. If you immobilize
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=46s)** — a muscle or a joint, is it the muscle that actually keeps the shape
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=51s)** — of the arm? The answer is no. It's this right here.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=56s)** — So in our bodies we have saran wrap. We have a certain
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=59s)** — wrapping tissue that surrounds the muscle.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=62s)** — And that tissue is called fascia.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=65s)** — Fascia is the bag that surrounds the arm
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=68s)** — and holds everything in a nice tight
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=72s)** — way. And in this diagram here you'll see you have the skin
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=75s)** — and then just underneath it you have a layer of fat.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=79s)** — It's called subcutaneous fat. And then you have the first layer
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=82s)** — of fascia. Okay.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=85s)** — And then you have another layer of fat.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=88s)** — And then you have another layer of fascia. And then you have the muscle.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=93s)** — And fascia also becomes immobilized
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=98s)** — with immobility and aging.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=101s)** — Yes, you might have some fat there that needs to be dealt with
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=104s)** — but probably the bigger problem is this atrophy of the fascia
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=107s)** — and the muscle. Now there's an interesting book that I'm reading
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=110s)** — right here. Fascia treatment with shock waves which
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=114s)** — I'm not recommending in this video anything about the shock waves. That
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=117s)** — would be
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=118s)** — for more of a myofascial problem which
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=122s)** — we're not talking about. But I want to share something in this book,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=126s)** — this very expensive book. Fascia
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=129s)** — can change its tone. It has contractile cells within the fascia
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=134s)** — itself. It can change its tone. So the question is
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=138s)** — how? We just basically undo the immobility and we start to
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=143s)** — move it. But here's the problem. If you do this
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=148s)** — on more of an isolated basis where you're just working two muscles, right?
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=153s)** — You're extending the tricep or you're
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=155s)** — contracting the bicep. That doesn't involve the fascia. It only
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=159s)** — involves the muscle. Fascia is much more
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=163s)** — dynamic and it crosses over a lot of different muscle groups.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=167s)** — So the type of solution that I'm going to recommend
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=170s)** — is not a two-dimensional contraction relaxation type
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=174s)** — exercise but more of a functional exercise that involves like at least
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=179s)** — 20 muscles. Because it's all one continuous unit.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=183s)** — If you're just going to focus on this one small area with...
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=187s)** — if you're neglecting what it's connected to, the back part,
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=191s)** — we're probably not going to see much change. So I'm going to show you the
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=195s)** — exercises to start out with. Which I'm going to put a link down below.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=198s)** — Rather than reinvent the wheel, you just need to watch how this person does
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=202s)** — this exercise because she did a wonderful job of doing
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=205s)** — the most incredible dynamic functional exercises
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=210s)** — with the arms without any added weight. The fascia adds elasticity,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=218s)** — flexibility, posture. It holds everything up. If we didn't have it,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=223s)** — we'd just basically be this big ball of mush. So really,
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=227s)** — the solution is a lot of movement in that area.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=230s)** — Even in anatomy and physiology, when you take the courses, you learn the
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=234s)** — origin insertion of the muscles. And that's important.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=238s)** — But in life, we're not just using like one or two muscles.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=241s)** — The motions that we do in living are very, very dynamic.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=245s)** — And that's why going to the gym and just isolating
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=248s)** — one muscle at a time, I don't think is the best workout. Especially
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=252s)** — for your fascia because the fascia wraps around and it goes to other muscles.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=257s)** — It's one big sheath that kind of covers everything.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=261s)** — All right, so here's the first step. Okay. And I would recommend watching
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=264s)** — this entire video. But this is an arm workout. So as
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=269s)** — you can see, she has a timer there. You can follow along.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=274s)** — And she's just about ready to show you the first exercise
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=278s)** — that involve not just the arm, but the shoulder itself.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=283s)** — No weights. Okay, then she goes to another workout right here where she's doing a
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=288s)** — different motion. Okay, this involving the shoulders, the arms, etc.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=295s)** — Then she does a series of additional exercises, including this one where she's
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=299s)** — pushing her arms out and in. Okay, looks easy.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=305s)** — Incredibly difficult. Okay, your arms are going to
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=308s)** — burn. So just do as much as you can this first workout. You don't want to get too
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=311s)** — sore. Now what you're doing in this functional exercise, you're doing a
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=315s)** — series of moves and motions that involve the fascia and the muscle.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=322s)** — And you're going to do this workout as much as you can until you have no
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=326s)** — more soreness. Now it could take a week before all the soreness goes
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=330s)** — away. And then you want to do it again. You're going to keep doing these
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=334s)** — exercises over and over and over until the point where you can do them
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=337s)** — comfortably. And there's very little, if any, soreness at all.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=342s)** — All right, so now that you went through this exercise, which you work
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=345s)** — in the muscle, we want to go heavier into the fascia using one of these
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=351s)** — right here. Okay, bands. And I found a really good exercise for that
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=360s)** — maneuver right here. We're going to take a look at it right now. Okay.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=364s)** — And you can see this person is taking these bands and they're stretching
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=371s)** — all the way to the lateral side of their body. And they're really
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=376s)** — activating the fascia. All the fascia that comes underneath here comes
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=381s)** — all the way down your arm through here. Okay. So what we want to do is
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=386s)** — we want to stretch all of that because it's not just the exercise
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=390s)** — that stimulates the reversal of atrophy. It's also stretching. Stretching
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=396s)** — will help activate the fascial bag around this tissue and start
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=401s)** — tightening it because it has contractile tissue. And of course,
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=404s)** — you want to do the other side. Okay, with these bands.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=409s)** — Do both sides. Okay, and you'll see that then he transitions to
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=415s)** — another maneuver, which is on your knees. It goes through that
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=419s)** — technique. Amazing stretches. I mean, for your fascia, it's going to
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=425s)** — tighten up underneath your arm and you're going to do both sides.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=429s)** — And then once you graduated from that video, there's one more
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=432s)** — that I found. That's awesome. Now you're going to add weight
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=436s)** — to your arms while you do some of these exercises. And this
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=439s)** — video is called solid arms and shoulders 30 minutes strength
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=443s)** — workout with dumbbells. Okay. And of course you want to use the
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=446s)** — weight for this. So maybe you start out with a five pound weight,
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=450s)** — go to a 10 pound weight, maybe a 15 pound weight, but probably
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=454s)** — not anything more than that. So in this exercise, you can see
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=458s)** — that she has dumbbells. And she's basically going to work
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=462s)** — her arms one at a time over her head, which I like this a
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=465s)** — lot better than doing curls because you're working the
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=468s)** — entire arm, shoulder, everything. So you're not just working
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=471s)** — the tricep. It's very functional, very simple. And she
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=476s)** — has a countdown so you can do that. This is a great video. So
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=479s)** — I don't have to reinvent the wheel. These are three amazing
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=482s)** — videos that I think you can use in the recovery of the
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=488s)** — fascia underneath your arm, as well as the atrophied
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=491s)** — muscle underneath your arms. And on that note, I have the
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALt5tgCFgg&t=495s)** — first video connected right here. Check it out.
