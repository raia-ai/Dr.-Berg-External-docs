- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=0s)** — The American Heart Association, the organization that is supposed to prevent heart disease, the number one killer worldwide.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=7s)** — And they showed up at a committee in Texas where they're trying to pass a bill.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=11s)** — This bill would restrict people from using food stamps for things like sugary drinks, candy, and other unhealthy foods.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=19s)** — For the American Heart Association to be against this bill, that might be the surprise of the session.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=25s)** — And out of all the groups that would oppose that bill, which shocked me, the American Heart Association's director for governmental relationships who came in and opposed it.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=33s)** — I certainly understand why that might be surprising.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=35s)** — Now, I think most people know that the American Heart Association gets a lot of funding from the junk food industry.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=41s)** — But from a public relations standpoint, you don't want the American Heart Association opposing something like that.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=48s)** — Well, they did. They were embarrassed.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=49s)** — The Heart Association is concerned about potential impacts of this bill on participation and population health.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=56s)** — I just was astonished that the American Heart Association was against our SNAP reform bill that would just say you can't have sugary drinks, you can't chips, cookies, limiting that and pushing people more to protein density rich foods.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=72s)** — They now say that they're no longer opposing that bill.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=75s)** — I certainly understand why that might be surprising.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=76s)** — Did you realize that of all the foods, soda is the single most frequent item bought under the SNAP program?
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=84s)** — There's a lot at stake for the soda industry because the subsidies, dollars from taxpayers, pay for the SNAP program in the amount of $10 billion, not million dollars, $10 billion a year for that soda, which then lead to obesity, type 2 diabetes, then feeds big pharma because they're treating the side effects from the junk food industry.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=105s)** — And on top of that, you have the American Heart Association that's supporting the funding of this thing.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=111s)** — The soda lobbyists are just going haywire.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=114s)** — Their latest meme or motto or campaign was saying that this is an issue of liberty, right?
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=120s)** — Freedom to choose what you want to eat.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=122s)** — The American Heart Association has so many conflicts of interest.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=126s)** — And what do I mean conflicts of interest?
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=128s)** — I mean money from actual industry, big pharma, big food.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=131s)** — They have a whole section of the American Heart Association called the Industry Nutrition Forum, where they have Pepsi, General Mills, etc, etc.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=141s)** — And of course, on various cereals, they have this little American Heart Association certified, okay, because they have the healthy grains of this whole grains.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=151s)** — You can pay to get this certification.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=153s)** — Of course, they have the frosted version right here, which also says can help you lower the cholesterol.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=159s)** — But I don't see the little seal right here.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=162s)** — Even though both of these have virtually the same amount of carbohydrates, both of these have whole grain oats, corn starch, sugar, corn syrup.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=172s)** — And of course, the soda industry is also hitting social media big time.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=176s)** — They're actually paying influencers a lot of money to help them object to this bill.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=182s)** — In fact, certain influencers were paid over a thousand dollars a post for objecting to this.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=187s)** — The campaigns that they're doing is they're pushing this food insecurity.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=192s)** — We need to provide cheap food.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=194s)** — The entire idea of subsidy came after the Depression when the farmers needed help.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=199s)** — And this has evolved into a very corrupt operation.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=202s)** — We're now we're making the junk food industry richer by paying for the raw material.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=206s)** — Did you realize that one metric ton of that dent corn with the subsidies is one hundred and ninety five dollars?
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=213s)** — Do you have any boxes of corn flakes you can make with one metric ton of dent corn?
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=219s)** — Basically, we're paying the junk food industry to make this junk food.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=223s)** — Then we're subsidizing the government SNAP program food stamps to make it very easy for people to consume this food.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=230s)** — Now realize we already paid for a lot of the raw material for these junk foods to be made.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=234s)** — Now we as taxpayers pay a second time for certain people that have food stamps to consume that junk food,
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=241s)** — which we know 90 percent of chronic disease comes from junk food.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=245s)** — And the majority of big pharma treats the side effects from junk food.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=249s)** — So as you can see, the system is not broken. It's working perfectly.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=253s)** — It's just not working for you. Do the people that subsidize the SNAP program benefit?
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=258s)** — No. Who benefits? Big food and big pharma. Here's my thought on this whole thing.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=262s)** — I think they should continue the SNAP program for nutrient dense foods, not ultra processed foods,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=268s)** — because that would not only reduce chronic disease, it would also save a tremendous amount of money with all the prescription medication.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=276s)** — We're really in a PR war right now where the junk food industry is trying everything it can to maintain these profits because there's a tremendous amount of money at stake.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=287s)** — Just the soda industry subsidies alone. Ten billion dollars.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=292s)** — A lot of the sweetener in the soda is high fructose corn syrup.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=295s)** — It goes to the liver. It creates a fatty liver, creates high blood pressure, it creates diabetes, it inflames the inside of the arteries, it starts heart disease.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=304s)** — But it's mind blowing to me that out of all the organizations, the American Heart Association was the one that stood up and opposed this bill.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=313s)** — You have to realize that the junk food industry never is the one that's objecting to it.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=318s)** — They use other organizations or front groups to do that type of work.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7Hz6QQCOM&t=322s)** — Anyway, I am just really curious what you think about this topic. Please let me know in the comments down below.
