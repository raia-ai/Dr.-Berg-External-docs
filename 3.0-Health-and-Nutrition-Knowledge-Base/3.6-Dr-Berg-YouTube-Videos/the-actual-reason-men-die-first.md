- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=0s)** — One of my favorite drinks for the liver is a combination between apple cider vinegar and lemon.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=5s)** — Today let's talk about the benefits of combining both of these amazing ingredients into one drink.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=11s)** — Let's talk about apple cider vinegar in itself. Some people have this idea that it's filled with
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=16s)** — all sorts of nutrients and you have the mother that's doing all these wonderful things. Well,
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=21s)** — there's not actually a lot of nutrients in apple cider vinegar. There's a little bit.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=25s)** — Also the mother. Yes, it might have some enzymes and some probiotics, but mainly it's sediment.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=32s)** — So it's not some magical thing that's creating these effects. It's mainly the basic acetic acid.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=39s)** — But this acetic acid is quite amazing. First of all, it's an acid made by certain bacteria
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=45s)** — that has a lot of cool effects on our bodies. It will address some big problems that a lot of
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=52s)** — especially insulin resistance. It helps you make insulin more sensitive. So insulin works in the
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=59s)** — body. And if you have diabetes or pre-diabetes or you just have insulin resistance,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=64s)** — apple cider vinegar can help correct this problem. Because if insulin is made more
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=69s)** — sensitive, you're going to have better blood sugar. You're going to have better cognitive
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=73s)** — function. You're going to store less fat in the liver. You're going to have less inflammation.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=79s)** — So apple cider vinegar can actually stop that whole process from occurring
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=83s)** — and in some aspects potentially could reverse it. Apple cider vinegar also helps this thing
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=89s)** — called oxidative stress. So all this free radical damage that can happen. Apple cider
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=94s)** — vinegar can kind of slow it down. Apple cider vinegar also helps you store glycogen in the
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=101s)** — liver. And so that's going to actually help you with exercise and your capacity to use
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=106s)** — your stored fuel in the liver as well as the muscles. And at the same time, the brain will get
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=113s)** — fuel from the liver. Also I've noticed a great lessening of the appetite when you do apple
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=119s)** — cider vinegar and better digestion, less bloating. Now I will say most of the research
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=124s)** — I'm going to put down below on apple cider vinegar backing up some of these claims are done
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=129s)** — on mice. Okay, so if you have, I don't know, a pet hamster, pet mouse, definitely put them
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=135s)** — on apple cider vinegar as well. Now as far as the type of apple cider vinegar, organic, okay.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=142s)** — I prefer Fairchild's over Bragg's because they don't dilute it. Is it important to have the mother?
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=148s)** — Not necessarily. We're after a high quality acetic acid. And as far as commercial apple cider
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=155s)** — vinegar that's not organic, you know it could contain pesticides and stuff like that. So just
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=159s)** — make sure you get the organic type. Now let's switch gears to lemon, right? Now you could just
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=165s)** — do lemon juice or you could just juice the lemon or you could just blend the whole lemon,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=171s)** — which takes more time. And of course, if you have a drink that blends the lemon, you'll have
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=175s)** — a lot of extra benefits, especially the phytonutrients, the essential oils that are in the
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=180s)** — outside peel. There's all sorts of flavonoids, which are just natural compounds that have a lot
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=187s)** — different effects from antioxidant effects to anti-inflammatory. So basically in a lemon,
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=193s)** — you have citric acid, which is good to prevent kidney stones. It will also help you support
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=198s)** — the mitochondria. Also you have vitamin C, unless you are taking lemon juice from a bottle
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=205s)** — that's been pasteurized. So combined, it creates a hipato protective effect, liver protecting
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=213s)** — There's been some studies, of course, on mice that have drinking alcohol that it can help to
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=219s)** — reduce the liver enzymes. So if your mice tend to be drinkers, give them some lemon right
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=226s)** — after. There's also some interesting studies on using lemon for problems with different
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=232s)** — lipids and cholesterol imbalances. And some of that research, they used garlic combined with
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=238s)** — But it was pretty credible. This was done on humans and it was a randomized double blinded
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=244s)** — placebo controlled trial. There's also a study I found where lemon can help reduce fat on your
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=250s)** — liver. For the most part, it's going to help reduce free radical damage and oxidative stress.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=255s)** — And very simply, and this is what I like about this, it's simple. You get a glass of water,
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=259s)** — 12 ounces, sometimes 16 ounces, whatever you want to do. And you put a tablespoon of
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=263s)** — And put a tablespoon of lemon juice or squeeze the entire juice from a lemon or blend the
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=272s)** — entire lemon. I would recommend using a straw so you don't affect the teeth because it's
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=277s)** — going to be slightly acidic and over time it could affect the enamel, but not if you use
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=282s)** — a straw. But I have to emphasize sometimes when I've recommended alpacite vinegar and
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=286s)** — lemon, sometimes people just drink it straight without adding the water. So it's going to,
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=292s)** — it's a little bit too acidic. So don't do that. The only time I probably wouldn't do this drink
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=296s)** — is if you feel like you have this severe burning in your stomach, which could mean you
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=302s)** — have an ulcer, in which case you don't want to be taking alpacite vinegar in your gut.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=307s)** — However, many people that have indigestion, heartburn, acid reflux don't have an ulcer. So
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=313s)** — this is probably just a reminder of this drink because you probably already know about it,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=317s)** — but it's actually a very simple thing that can create some really cool benefits,
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=321s)** — as well as giving you energy. Now, if you haven't seen this video on alpacite vinegar,
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_b9yXz0lsM&t=326s)** — it's actually very interesting. I put it up right here. Check it out.
