- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=0s)** — So many people look at walking as a very trivial thing. And sometimes they'll think it's just kind
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=5s)** — of a waste of time because think about how much production or productive things you can do in place
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=11s)** — of, you know, walking for 45 minutes. Well, after today's video that might change your mind because
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=17s)** — walking is probably one of the most therapeutic things you can do. And the majority of these
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=22s)** — benefits I'm going to talk about related to walking are things that you probably have never
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=28s)** — heard before. I mean, we know walking helps you, you know, maybe lose some weight, maybe reduce stress,
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=35s)** — but how does it reduce stress? That's the question. The first point, I'm going to dive right in,
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=40s)** — is this. When you walk you significantly lower your cortisol levels even after a 20-minute walk.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=48s)** — So what does this mean? When you have high levels of cortisol your body is in this
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=53s)** — adapt mode. It's adapting your physiology to your environment, to stress. So walking turns
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=61s)** — off that mechanism. So you're less in this flight or fight sympathetic dominance mode and
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=67s)** — more in the parasympathetic. So that's why you feel calmer. That's why you feel less
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=71s)** — stress because now the body is not stuck in this stress reaction mode. And so with lower
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=77s)** — levels of cortisol and adrenaline you're going to feel better. Even on DNA testing there's a
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=82s)** — certain gene that causes the person to hold on to adrenaline longer. And the remedy for that is
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=90s)** — to exercise and flush it out. Not necessarily always high intensity but some low intensity
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=98s)** — long walks. Alright, number two, which relates to number one. You're going to have improved
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=103s)** — creativity. And what I mean by that is more creative thinking. Think about this. When you're
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=109s)** — in stress mode and you have high levels of cortisol, what is your level of creativity?
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=115s)** — It's pretty low. It's almost impossible to be creative when you're under stress, when you
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=120s)** — have high levels of cortisol. And this definitely relates to problem solving as well because when
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=125s)** — you solve problems you need creativity and when you have stress you're not really good at
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=130s)** — solving problems like you would if you were more calm and you had more creativity. Going
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=135s)** — on a long walk gives you this new space, this ability to look at things a little bit easier.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=142s)** — It gives you space between you and the problem. So the problem is not like all up here. You have
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=147s)** — space now. You can kind of look at it. You can kind of play with it. You can come up with
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=152s)** — solutions. Number three, which relates to number two, this is going to affect your overall
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=156s)** — mood. You're going to have less anxiety. You'll be less depressed. Alright, number four,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=161s)** — the mitochondria inside your cells, which is the energy factory, and most diseases are associated
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=167s)** — with damaged mitochondria. They call it a problem with your metabolism. And that really
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=172s)** — relates to how well that your cells are fed fuel and oxygen and etc. So when you go on
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=179s)** — long walks you enhance the quality of mitochondria. You enhance the numbers of mitochondria.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=187s)** — Mitochondria become more efficient at burning fuel. And the better your mitochondria work,
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=193s)** — the less diseases you'll have. Number five, and this is interesting, exercise, especially
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=198s)** — walking, increases microbial diversity. You'll have more diverse types of microbes. That's
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=205s)** — pretty wild, which is going to help a lot of things. It's going to help your immune system.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=208s)** — It's going to help your digestion. It's going to help your energy. And number six,
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=213s)** — walking improves or increases your endogenous antioxidants. What does endogenous mean?
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=220s)** — It means something from within. In other words, your body has the ability to create
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=226s)** — antioxidants. And when you do walks, you actually create more of your own antioxidants.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=232s)** — And this is nothing to do with what you're eating. Your body is just making more antioxidant
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=237s)** — networks, which is going to help you fight off free radicals. It's going to actually help
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=242s)** — longevity. It's going to help prevent a lot of problems. Number seven, walking actually increases
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=250s)** — your natural killer cells. These are part of the immune system and they actually kill cancer
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=256s)** — cells and viruses. Well, walking increases the natural killer cells. Number eight,
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=261s)** — walking improves insulin and glucose sensitivity. So if you have insulin resistance,
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=269s)** — if you have a problem with glucose, walking improves this to the point where it can
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=276s)** — significantly decrease the resistance to insulin, which is going to help your blood sugars. So if
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=281s)** — you're a diabetic or a pre-diabetic, walking is awesome. And even if you had the dawn
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=286s)** — phenomena where you wake up in the morning and your blood sugars are high, going for a long
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=290s)** — walk can burn off that sugar. And that's what happens for the first, I don't know, about 25,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=294s)** — 30 minutes as you burn off all this extra sugar you have and then you start burning fat.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=300s)** — All right, number nine. And this is interesting because yes, it is true when you walk,
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=306s)** — you get more oxygen, but it's not about getting more oxygen in your blood. It's about what
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=311s)** — happens between your blood cells and your tissue cells. Are you absorbing more oxygen
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=318s)** — from that blood saturation? Okay, like even if you do an intense workout where you're
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=323s)** — breathing heavily, right? You think you're getting all this air, but it's kind of like having a cup
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=329s)** — that's filled with water and then you try to add more water to it. It's already filled.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=334s)** — It just kind of flows over. That's what happens when you exercise intensely when you're
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=338s)** — over breathing. You're getting all this oxygen, but it's not being delivered into the tissues.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=342s)** — In fact, you probably feel like you have to breathe harder to get more oxygen into the
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=347s)** — But here's the key. It is true that you need oxygen, right? But to deliver and transport that
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=354s)** — oxygen, CO2 is needed. CO2 is not just a waste product. It's essential to make sure that
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=360s)** — oxygen is delivered deep into the tissues. So whereas certain type of high intensity
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=366s)** — exercise is good for certain things, walking is good for getting oxygen deep into the cells
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=372s)** — because you're not breathing too much. You're not flooding your body with too much oxygen.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=378s)** — You're getting a nice balance of oxygen and CO2, which is the key to deliver that oxygen,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=386s)** — especially if you breathe through your nose. You'll get like 20% more oxygen if you're
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=391s)** — walking. And for people that walk maybe a little bit faster, they are generating
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=397s)** — And then acid tends to inhibit oxygen. So what happens in your blood is you have
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=404s)** — certain things that are alkaline. They're called bicarbonates and that's going to help
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=409s)** — neutralize this lactic acid fairly quickly. And then the byproduct chemistry of that is
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=416s)** — H2O, water and carbon dioxide. So your body actually is getting CO2 from that process as
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=423s)** — Number 10, bone density increases when walking. Interesting. Number 11, reduced inflammation.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=432s)** — You're also reducing stiffness but motion in general and getting this oxygen to the tissues
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=437s)** — is going to help reduce inflammation. And the last thing that walking will do is enhance your
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=442s)** — vision and from several different ways. First of all, you get more oxygen to your brain
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=446s)** — and your retina is a part of your brain sticking out into your eyeball. And also
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=452s)** — you're going to improve insulin sensitivity which is going to help your eyes, your kidneys,
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=457s)** — your nerves because it's going to help blood sugars. So this is why you should make walking
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=462s)** — a very important good habit in your life. Now just to balance this video, I think the next
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=468s)** — video for you to watch is the importance of high intensity interval training. Check it out.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hobt4Pb4iA&t=474s)** — I put it right here.
