- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=0s)** — Probably out of all the things to figure out if you're on the right diet or not, it's bloating.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=6s)** — When we're dealing with bloating, we're dealing with the small intestine. This is a tube that's
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=10s)** — 22 feet long and it has a very large surface area. If we open it up and stretch it out,
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=17s)** — the surface area is roughly about 2,700 square feet or about 250 square meters.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=24s)** — The bottom line is you have a lot of service area for absorption of food because 90% of
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=29s)** — all your digestion and nutrition happens in the small intestine. If you get inflammation,
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=35s)** — if you get an infection, or you take a medication, or you have food allergies,
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=40s)** — all of this can irritate that lining and cut down the surface area of that absorption of
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=47s)** — nutrients. And then you're left with nutritional deficiencies, vitamin D, as well as bile salts.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=53s)** — You're supposed to recycle these bile salts. So if you run out of bile, now we can't absorb
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=58s)** — one of the purposes of bile is to get rid of excess cholesterol. There's a condition called
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=64s)** — SIBO, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. That's where you have a lot of microbes that
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=72s)** — normally should be in the large intestine, but they're in the wrong place. When you eat food,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=76s)** — especially fiber and things like that, you start getting tremendous amounts of bloating
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=81s)** — because you're getting this fermentation. See, fermentation is a different process,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=86s)** — that's supposed to be in the large intestine. And if it's in the small intestine, boy, you're
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=91s)** — going to get gas in the wrong place, and it's going to extend and create a lot of bloating,
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=96s)** — pain and discomfort. There are apparently certain microbes that can help it, but generally
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=102s)** — speaking, I wouldn't recommend adding more probiotics down there because you already have
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=106s)** — microbes there. On the flip side, let's say you don't have SIBO, you just have some type
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=111s)** — of inflammation or damage or scar tissue in that small intestine. Why would that be? How
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=115s)** — would you end up with that? Well, usually it comes from eating processed foods early on,
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=121s)** — seed oils, the synthetic starches, the synthetic sugars too. So all that creates inflammation,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=127s)** — it depletes your nutrients, it feeds the pathogens, and now you have this inflammatory
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=133s)** — condition. Realize the more inflammation you have, the less you can absorb in the small
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=138s)** — intestine. The solution is to do carnivore for a couple months, at least to clean out the gut
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=144s)** — while you also do intermittent fasting. It'd probably be beneficial if you took
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=148s)** — betaine hydrochloride as an acidifier to actually help strengthen the stomach. If
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=154s)** — you're constantly shoving food down this pipe, you don't have a chance to let it go through,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=159s)** — it keeps the bacteria just growing. So we have those two conditions, but we also have
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=165s)** — another condition where you don't have SIBO, but you have bloating. And you might have other
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=170s)** — issues too, like constipation. And your stool might float, which means you're not digesting
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=179s)** — your fats. And it could be either your gallbladder, your pancreas,
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=183s)** — or it could be some type of dysfunction with your digestion. So in some cases,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=188s)** — it might be beneficial to cut back on your fiber and then slowly increase it, because
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=195s)** — that way you're feeding the microbes, you have better digestion, and you have better stool.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=199s)** — I consume a lot of fiber from plants, right, from salads and things like that. I don't get
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=204s)** — them from grain or bran, because it's too much of a refined product. When you have a salad,
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=208s)** — you're eating the whole thing. There's just a lot of benefits in that salad,
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=212s)** — beyond the fiber to the microbes, even the phytonutrients can help these microbes to a
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=217s)** — certain degree. But the way to get more microbes is to slowly increase the amount of like
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=223s)** — salads you eat, starting off with maybe a couple cups to then gradually over some weeks,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=228s)** — more and more and more and more, where you're doing like seven or more cups per day. But if
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=234s)** — you want to increase the diversity of microbes, which will make things even better, then you use
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=238s)** — different types of plants. You can also do fasting to increase the diversity as well.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=243s)** — Vitamin B1, though, is another really important factor for constipation, because B1
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=249s)** — is all about supporting the nervous system. Another thing that can help that is having
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=253s)** — magnesium, as well as potassium, and even sodium. So you need these electrolytes
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=260s)** — for the prefrontal cramping of the colon. The absolute best way to know if what you're eating
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=265s)** — is the right diet is to see how you bloat. Okay, to see if there's any bloating or not.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=272s)** — If the stools are coming out really good, there's no bloating, no pain, you're feeling good,
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=277s)** — then whatever diet you're on, don't change anything. And I created another really popular
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=283s)** — video that's a little bit more in depth on bloating. And if you haven't seen that one,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-7pN5UMV-Q&t=286s)** — I put it up right here. Check it out.
