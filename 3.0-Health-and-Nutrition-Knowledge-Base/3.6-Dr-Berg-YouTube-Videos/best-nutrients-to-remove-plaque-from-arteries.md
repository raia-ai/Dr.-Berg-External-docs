- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the best nutrients to remove plaque from your arteries. When I talk about
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=6s)** — plaque, I'm talking about three things. The combination of cholesterol, a certain type of
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=11s)** — protein that creates the fibrosis, and we'll talk about calcium. These are the three ingredients
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=16s)** — to form a band-aid when you have inflammation or some type of problem in the inside of your
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=21s)** — artery. The first thing to know is there's two types of plaque. There's soft plaque,
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=28s)** — and then there's hard plaque or calcified plaque. They're both very, very different. The soft plaque
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=34s)** — is very unstable. It's more dangerous. The hard plaque, the more dense plaque, the more stable,
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=43s)** — the less dangerous. The soft plaque is four times as common as the calcified plaque. When you
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=50s)** — get a CAC test, they give you a score. And this score really represents how much plaque
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=56s)** — you have in your arteries, mainly the calcified plaque. Because a lot of the soft plaque is
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=61s)** — involved in the turning into calcified plaque, that does not show up on a CAC score. Now,
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=69s)** — there's something called a CAC paradox in which you might find that your CAC score
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=75s)** — goes up after changing your diet, cleaning up the bad stuff, and starting to get healthy.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=82s)** — The score might go up. Well, what's happening is not getting worse. You're just converting more of
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=87s)** — that soft plaque to hard plaque where it becomes more stable. And there's some other tests that
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=93s)** — you can do, which I'm going to explain at the end, that will help you identify more of
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=98s)** — the soft plaque. Because that CAC test really is not the best test to pick up this soft,
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=105s)** — dangerous, unstable plaque. But I will talk about what tests you should do about this to
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=110s)** — assess this problem in a moment. You usually have something called glycation connected to it.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=116s)** — What is glycation? It's where you have a sugar and a protein that gets stuck together. And so
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=122s)** — that's involved in a certain protein that kind of locks up and creates problems and inflammation
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=126s)** — in your body. This soft plaque is usually involved with more oxidation, okay, especially
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=133s)** — of the LDL. And I'm not talking about LDL in general. I'm talking about the one that's more
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=138s)** — pathogenic. There's two types of LDL. There's the LDL that's much smaller. It's called the small
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=145s)** — dense LDL. Okay, that's the more dangerous type, the more pathogenic type versus the other LDL,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=152s)** — which is very different. It's the large buoyant type, and it's not the pathogenic type. You
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=157s)** — just have to realize there's two types. I'm going to show you a very simple way to
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=163s)** — use what they give you on your blood test to determine what type of LDL you have.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=168s)** — The first one, it's a long name, myeloperoxidase. The next one is Lp-PLA2.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=177s)** — So those are the two biomarkers that help pick up if you have this soft plaque. Now,
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=183s)** — another test that probably would be even better if you can do this. And it's a relatively
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=189s)** — inexpensive, quick, non-invasive test. It's an ultrasound of your carotids. And that gives like
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=195s)** — a 98.6% prediction of having the problem. There's some other really important values to look at,
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=202s)** — too, is your HDL. Okay, you want that to go up. HDL tends to clean up that pathogenic bad
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=210s)** — LDL. The next thing you want to see on the low side is triglycerides, because if the
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=216s)** — triglycerides are high, then you can pretty much know the person's consuming too many carbs.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=222s)** — Now, there's another test that if you can get this, it's a really good way of assessing what's
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=228s)** — really going on with these lipids. Okay, and it's called lipoprotein insulin resistance.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=235s)** — If you happen to get a blood test and you can request this, it'd be very, very important
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=239s)** — to know where your number is at. Because out of all of the factors, that's the one that's
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=244s)** — associated with cardiovascular atherosclerosis. All right, so now let's discuss how one can figure
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=252s)** — out if they have the small dense particles for the LDL versus the large buoyant, okay,
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=259s)** — without even doing that test. What you do is you divide the LDL by something else
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=266s)** — called APO-B. It's part of the lipoprotein that indicates the number of particles.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=274s)** — Ideally, we want it to be greater than 1.2, which will indicate large buoyant LDL, which is
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=283s)** — the non-pathogenic version. Now, all of that is very interesting and a bit complex. So I'm going
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=289s)** — to jump into what nutrients can help remove this plaque. Okay, well, the first two nutrients
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=295s)** — are number one, pycnogonal. That's pine bark. You'd want to take 150 milligrams. Pycnogonal helps
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=302s)** — convert the soft plaque to the calcified plaque where it becomes more stable. And also it
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=309s)** — prevents the formation of plaque. And the next one is called gotecola. You'd want to take 450
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=315s)** — milligrams of gotecola. Gotecola helps enhance the function of pycnogonal. So it's going to
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=322s)** — this conversion to more stable plaque. It will also prevent the formation of plaque.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=327s)** — Number three remedy is vitamin K2, which is the most potent inhibitor of vascular
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=338s)** — calcification. It basically stops the calcification from occurring in your arteries.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=345s)** — I would not recommend taking vitamin K2 in micrograms. I would recommend taking it in
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=351s)** — milligrams. And I've looked around to find a supplement that will give you the amounts in
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=357s)** — milligrams. There's not many. And I personally don't have a product like that. And I don't
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=361s)** — have any affiliations or associations with any other companies that do. Except I did find one
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=366s)** — company that does have it, does provide it. It's life extension. It's called mega K2. I'll
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=371s)** — put that link down below. So the next remedy is natokinase. Natokinase can help decrease
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=377s)** — the thickness of the carotid wall. And the last remedy is called niacin. Don't get the
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=384s)** — sustained release one. Get the one that creates the flush. I know some people don't like that.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=389s)** — But as far as cholesterol goes, it is what you need. Now I'm not advocating that you take
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=394s)** — just a lot of nutrition. I'm giving you the ones that are the most potent. I'm also
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=398s)** — going to talk about some other ones next that also create some amazing effects for
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=404s)** — I just want to mention them because I don't want to leave them out. Toquatrinols helps decrease
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=409s)** — inflammation of the arteries. It's a type of vitamin E. Berberine is a really good one.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=414s)** — You have also aged garlic. You have magnesium and potassium that helps to soften up the
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=422s)** — arteries if they're stiff and rigid. And then you have vitamin D, which is a very potent
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=427s)** — anti-inflammatory. Really good for the arteries. Really good as an anti-placking
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=432s)** — And so I put a lot of the references that I talked about down below. Check them out.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=437s)** — But if you would like to know the best meal or foods to help you avoid placking,
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeB31exaNA&t=441s)** — I put that video up right here. Check it out.
