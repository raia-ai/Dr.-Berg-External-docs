- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=0s)** — What if I were to tell you, you could take one tablespoon of something and help yourself
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=6s)** — lose more belly fat? Would you be interested? If so, there's a really great natural solution.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=11s)** — And this goes beyond the typical eat less, exercise more, etc. This talk is mainly for
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=18s)** — the person that has a slow metabolism and they need an unfair advantage. But I need
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=24s)** — to really clarify something because people that say they have a slow metabolism actually
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=28s)** — don't have a slow metabolism. It's not that the metabolism is slow, it's just very efficient.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=37s)** — Okay, if we take a Hummer on the side versus a hybrid Camry, what would be the main difference?
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=43s)** — Well, one is a gas guzzler and one is more efficient with its fuel, right? The Hummer gets
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=48s)** — about 16 mpg and the hybrid Camry gets around 51 mpg. Huge difference. So with people that
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=57s)** — have a difficult time losing weight, their real problem is deep in the motor. The motor is just
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=63s)** — too efficient. They can go a longer period of time with less fuel compared to someone with a
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=68s)** — so-called high metabolism. So the question is, how can we switch your motor over to
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=74s)** — a system that is more of a gas guzzler and you're in a situation where you're wasting
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=79s)** — more fuel? That would be a good goal, wouldn't it? This is probably going to be a new term for
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=84s)** — you, but it's called mitochondrial uncoupling. Well, the mitochondria is the energy factory
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=91s)** — that turns food into ATP, which is kind of like a storage form of energy. And I think the best
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=97s)** — way to describe uncoupling related to the mitochondria to make it really simple is that
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=101s)** — the mitochondria is going to make less ATP and more heat. So what's happening instead of making
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=109s)** — this storage form of energy, it's basically just creating a lot of heat and that heat can be
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=114s)** — wasted. So today's talk is about discovering what you can use as a mitochondrial uncoupler.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=122s)** — Now there's a certain weight loss drug, which I don't even think it's still in the market,
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=125s)** — in the U.S. at least. It's called 2,4-dinitrophenol, but we're just going to
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=130s)** — call it DNP. Okay, this is a drug. And if I'm not mistaken, it was taken off the market
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=135s)** — because yes, it helped people lose weight very fast, but it created some pretty serious side
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=143s)** — effects. It overheated the body. People were sweating extensively. Now aspirin, by the way,
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=150s)** — is another mitochondrial uncoupler, which I'm not going to recommend that even though it may
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=154s)** — help you lose a little weight because it's a drug and it causes side effects like, you know,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=159s)** — a bleeding ulcer. But other than that, it's perfectly fine. Now there's another drug called
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=164s)** — which is a dewormer. And it's also been tested to help lose weight in mice studies. I don't think
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=172s)** — they repurposed it for a weight loss medication, but it too does what's called mitochondrial
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=178s)** — uncoupling. Now the question is, is there a natural mitochondrial uncoupler? And yes,
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=184s)** — there is. The first thing that can help increase it is something called resveratrol.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=189s)** — Now what's interesting about resveratrol, resveratrol is in several things. It's in grapes,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=196s)** — cranberries, it's in blueberries, it's also in dark chocolate, it's in pistachios, and it's
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=202s)** — especially in something called Japanese knockweed. They make that into a tea. And they do have
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=207s)** — resveratrol in a powder. So if you were going to take a like tablespoon a day, that
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=212s)** — could help you. But what's interesting about resveratrol and all the berries that I just
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=217s)** — mentioned is that they're all polyphenols. And even in the chocolate, it's loaded with polyphenols.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=224s)** — Okay. Now remember when I talk about that drug 2,4-dinitrophenol? Apparently there's an
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=230s)** — interesting connection between phenols, right? Polyphenols and just regular phenols. The
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=235s)** — chemistry of phenols apparently can create a mitochondrial uncoupling effect. Now there's
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=241s)** — some other things that can create this uncoupling as well. Ketones. This is probably
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=246s)** — one of the reasons why people lose more weight when they do the ketogenic diet. And of course,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=251s)** — ketones actually help the mitochondria just work better in general. Then we have cold
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=255s)** — therapy. Think about what happens when you do cold immersion or cold shower. The core
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=260s)** — temperature needs to always be constant. And your body is going to fight like heck to
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=265s)** — keep that core temperature at 98.6. So think about how much heat you'd have to generate
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=270s)** — to do that. And when you're doing cold immersion, you're not exercising. You're not
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=275s)** — eating differently. You're just experiencing a lot of uncomfortableness and you're generating
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=281s)** — a tremendous amount of heat and you're burning a lot of fat. Then we have another one called
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=285s)** — exercise. That's right. Exercise helps the mitochondria waste energy. Fasting is another
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=292s)** — way of creating uncoupling. Green tea has a mild effect of mitochondrial uncoupling. And
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=299s)** — even doing a sauna or a jacuzzi creates a similar effect to mitochondrial uncoupling.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=306s)** — Now on the flip side, what are some things that will block this mitochondrial uncoupling?
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=311s)** — That would be important to know. Number one, excess calories. Think about it. When
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=317s)** — you eat too much, and what I mean too much is I'm talking about you're eating
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=321s)** — excess of what your mitochondria can burn, you inhibit this mitochondrial uncoupling
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=326s)** — and you worsen the mitochondria. This could be eating way too many carbs, too much sugar like
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=332s)** — the average person, but it can also mean eating too much fat. This is something I rarely talk
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=337s)** — about, but I think it's important not to overeat because you're forcing your body to overload
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=342s)** — that mitochondria and your body can't burn it off. Now if you exercise a lot, then you
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=348s)** — need to eat more. But how many people are eating just too much for their activity level
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=353s)** — and their age? This also includes the snacking. This is why intermittent fasting
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=358s)** — is a really great strategy as well. Aging, as you get older, we have less mitochondrial
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=364s)** — uncoupling. The more sedentary you are, the less effect you're going to create with this
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=369s)** — uncoupling. The more you're exposed to heavy metals, that can also block the mitochondria.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=374s)** — And certain medications, especially statins, beta blockers, metformin, and antibiotics,
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=383s)** — now if you want to know the details of exactly what to eat for the healthy version of the
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRp_nuoO8FE&t=388s)** — ketogenic diet, it's in this video right here. Check it out.
