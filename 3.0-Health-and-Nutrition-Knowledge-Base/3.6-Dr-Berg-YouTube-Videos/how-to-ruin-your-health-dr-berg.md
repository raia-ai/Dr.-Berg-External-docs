- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=0s)** — Hello and welcome to How to Completely Ruin Your Health and Well-Being.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=4s)** — If you're looking to make terrible choices and sabotage your future health,
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=8s)** — you've come to the right place. Let's dive right into my recommendations.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=12s)** — Realize there is no bad food group. As long as you eat in moderation,
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=17s)** — you can eat absolutely anything. This includes junk food in moderation.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=22s)** — But let's not call it junk food. Let's call it fast food or ultra-processed food.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=27s)** — That will make you feel a little bit better. The next time you go buy food,
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=31s)** — spend most of your time in the center of the grocery store, ignoring the perimeter.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=36s)** — This way you'll save a lot of money. And this is where all the cheap,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=39s)** — empty calorie food is located. And don't forget to bring your kids.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=43s)** — Just make sure they're hungry and tired before you walk into the store.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=47s)** — Make sure you buy no vegetables or meats or cheeses because they go bad very quickly.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=52s)** — Say hello to the ultra-processed sugary starches, seed oils, and processed snacks.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=56s)** — They virtually have no expiration date. Remember, the more artificial, the better.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=61s)** — And regarding red meat, it's like smoking a cigarette. It causes cancer.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=66s)** — So stick with the ultra-processed foods. You will not regret it.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=70s)** — Step number two. Enjoy life. Listen closely to this very important message.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=103s)** — So quench your thirst and get hydrated with these sugary sodas,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=108s)** — energy drinks, and sugar-laden fruit juices. But just make sure you ignore the fact that
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=112s)** — they might lead to weight gain, diabetes, and a whole host of other health issues.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=117s)** — But, so as they say, Coke adds life. Take that to the grave. I mean, take that to heart.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=123s)** — Also realize that our food pyramid is based on science. Just ignore the rumor that most
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=128s)** — of the scientists that actually created the dietary guidelines have conflict of interest.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=133s)** — You only live once, so enjoy yourself. Those wonderful, delicious chips that are like
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=140s)** — hydrogenated seed oils, added synthetic sugars, and monosodium glutamate will comfort your soul.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=146s)** — And as a really great benefit because of all the preservatives, they have no shelf life.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=150s)** — They'll last for years. So don't worry. Not even the bugs weed them.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=154s)** — These comfort foods will comfort you and protect you against the stresses of life.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=159s)** — Step three. Develop a sedentary lifestyle. Avoid any form of exercise and embrace your
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=165s)** — inner couch potato. Remember, mobility is overrated. Exercise can be dangerous. I mean,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=171s)** — you could slip and fall. It's much safer to stay inside your house. And studies have shown
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=177s)** — that if you just fidget more while you're watching TV and eating that popcorn, you can
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=181s)** — actually burn a few more calories per hour. But just make sure you always have plenty of
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=186s)** — excuses. The weather, the holidays, your busy schedule. Blame something, anything, because
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=191s)** — it's not your fault. Just cycle through your excuses and never admit that you have anything to
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=196s)** — do with any of your health problems. You've just been dealt some bad genes. You should
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=202s)** — have picked your parents a little bit more wisely. Step four. Always find a way to
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=207s)** — sabotage yourself. When you start making headway and make some healthy changes or maybe you
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=212s)** — start to lose some weight, reward yourself instantly with a donut, a nice glass of wine,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=218s)** — or a big bowl of ice cream. Step five. Stay inside. Avoid the outdoors at all costs.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=226s)** — Who needs sunshine, fresh air, and nature when you can stay indoors? In your own little bubble,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=231s)** — we do not want to let all that dangerous sun touch your skin. And if you do go outside,
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=237s)** — lather your body with sun blocker. That way you can block all your vitamin D. I'm sorry,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=242s)** — I meant UV radiation. Stay indoors because if that nasty air pollution doesn't get you,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=247s)** — the sun will. Couch surfing and binge watching TV should be your next main hobbies. It's much
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=253s)** — safer. Stay glued to that screen. And you know, any news about this EMF radiation coming off
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=259s)** — your computer screen or your TV screen, it's just fake news. Very soon, the metaverse will
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=264s)** — be here. Who needs a real world experience when you can live your entire life in a virtual
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=270s)** — reality bubble? Step six. Eat eight meals a day. Now let's talk about your new anti-intermittent
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=278s)** — fasting schedule. The eight meal a day strategy really works because you'll never feel hungry
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=284s)** — ever again. In fact, you'll be grazing all day long like a friendly cow. And don't forget
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=290s)** — to bring those snacks everywhere you go. After all, you never know when you might encounter
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=295s)** — a snack emergency. Blood sugar crash? No problem. That's why we have our glucose pills
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=301s)** — waiting for you. These will fix your hypoglycemia. Your doctor has got your back and they'll
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=306s)** — manage those blood sugar spikes and crashes while you enjoy your never-ending feast. Step
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=312s)** — seven. Realize all calories are exactly the same. And don't buy into this idea that certain
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=320s)** — certain hormones. Eating a 500 calorie meal of delicious donuts is exactly the same
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=326s)** — as eating a balanced whole food nutritionally dense 500 calorie meal. Remember, a calorie
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=331s)** — is a calorie. This is science. Step eight. Late night snacking. Develop a late night
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=338s)** — snacking habit and those high omega-6 fatty acid seed oil snacks. Hey, just go ahead
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=345s)** — and devour that giant bowl of ice cream before bedtime and induce a sugar coma. I'm sorry,
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=350s)** — I meant induce a good night's sleep. Step nine. Check with your doctor. Realize that
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=357s)** — alternative care could be very dangerous. So always check with your doctor before
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=362s)** — taking anything natural because they have the experience and training in nutrition.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=367s)** — They've done studies, you know. 60% of the time it works every time. But if in doubt,
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=374s)** — ask Dr. Google. This is your go-to 100% unbiased source of true information. And don't worry,
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=381s)** — if you have health and literacy, they will help you identify what true misinformation is as
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=386s)** — well. Step 10. Sleep. Listen, you'll have plenty of time to sleep when you're dead.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=391s)** — Sleeping is overrated. This is why God invented coffee. Drink as much coffee as you
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=397s)** — need to stay awake. Step 11. Embrace your inner pharmacy. Listen, health is about managing
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=404s)** — your diseases. Why bother staying healthy when you can keep your symptoms suppressed
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=408s)** — and your symptoms managed until someday when they find the cure? If one medication gives
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=413s)** — you a side effect, don't worry, we can give you another medication that can treat that side
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=418s)** — effect very easily. But don't worry, they wouldn't sell these drugs unless they were
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=422s)** — safe and effective. At least most of the time. I think it's really important to choose your
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=427s)** — side effect wisely. And lastly, step 12. Stay blind and unaware. Resist any change. Don't
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=434s)** — seek knowledge about nutrition, exercise, or diet. Bad habits are a normal part of life.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnbzWbKgvE&t=440s)** — Continue to believe that your health condition is genetic and there's nothing you can do about it.
