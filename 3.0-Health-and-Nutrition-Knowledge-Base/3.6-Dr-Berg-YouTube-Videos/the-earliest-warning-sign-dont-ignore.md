- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=0s)** — The number one early sign of dementia. You've never heard about this before. In fact, I just
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=5s)** — recently found out about it. And this involves everyone, especially if you want to prevent
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=10s)** — the different types of dementia, Alzheimer's, etc. I think most people know that the first
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=15s)** — symptom of a heart attack over 50% of the time is death because there is no symptom. And same
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=21s)** — thing with the liver. There really is no symptoms until the later stages when sometimes
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=26s)** — Well, guess what? The brain is the same thing. It takes decades to develop dementia. And in the
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=31s)** — meantime, there's virtually no symptoms except one, which I'm going to discuss. And this is
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=36s)** — because the different organs, especially the brain, just keep compensating over a period of
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=40s)** — time until they can't compensate anymore. And so the earliest sign of dementia involves the
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=46s)** — retina. It's nerve tissue that is literally sticking out of your skull in your eye socket.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=52s)** — The retina has certain cells that pick up information from the environment and allows you
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=56s)** — to see. And so they found a very large correlation between problems in the retina
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=61s)** — and problems in the brain, specifically with the outer layer of the retina. And then you
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=65s)** — have all sorts of issues with the eye itself. Problems with night vision, problems with
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=70s)** — central vision, floaters, light sensitivity issues. And a lot of times people will just
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=76s)** — get a new set of glasses. And they may even develop something called amyloid beta placking
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=83s)** — on the retina itself. At the end of the video and also in the description, I'll tell you
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=87s)** — what tests would pick this information up. You also might notice problems with detecting
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=93s)** — different shades of gray or even differentiate different colors as well. They also evaluated
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=98s)** — cadavers brains. And so they evaluated the retina with people with cognitive deficit,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=104s)** — like a mild version of dementia. And you start having more inflammation in the nervous system.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=108s)** — And then things start to go downhill after that. And another really interesting thing
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=113s)** — about the brains of Alzheimer's patients is they found high levels of a certain
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=118s)** — microbe that happens to be living in your teeth. It's actually a pathogen. And they're
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=122s)** — finding that in the placking of the brain. If someone has a dental infection or some type of
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=128s)** — periodontal disease, you could be leaking out bacteria that goes into the bloodstream that
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=132s)** — ends up in the brain. I mean, we also found dental bacteria in the placking of our heart as
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=137s)** — well. I have a very important new solution for all of this, but I just want to take a moment
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=142s)** — to just explain why people actually die from dementia. It's usually from some type of an
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=147s)** — infection, a UTI or maybe a lung infection. Or in the case of my mother-in-law who had
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=155s)** — Alzheimer's, it was a surgery. It created so much stress in the body. And after that,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=159s)** — just started going down and down a lot faster. On the other hand, sometimes you have a slow
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=164s)** — progressive degeneration of the brain to the point where a person is in hospice and they're
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=170s)** — bedridden. And then they just stop eating and stop drinking. And then that's what kills them.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=175s)** — Let's talk about what we can do about this. One of the most important things
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=179s)** — that you should focus on is cleaning your brain. If you have a lot of inflammation
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=183s)** — and placking in the brain, it's dirty. You can really look at this as like a dishwasher
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=187s)** — and they call it the glymphatic system that cleans the brain mainly at night.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=192s)** — That's one of the big purposes of sleeping is to be able to detoxify and clean the brain.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=197s)** — So you wake up and things are cleaned out. And what I mean by clean the brain is pull out
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=201s)** — some of these malformed proteins and the placking and rejuvenate the brain. Anything that
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=207s)** — inhibits sleeping increases your risk for Alzheimer's. In fact, anything that inhibits
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=211s)** — your sleeping less than six hours increases your risk for heart attacks, strokes, cancer,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=217s)** — blood sugar issues, type 2 diabetes. And so if you have sleep apnea, that is a problem.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=223s)** — And if you have sleep apnea, I'm going to put a link down below of what to do about it.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=226s)** — And you need to get eight or nine hours. And this is based on a book, Why We Sleep,
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=232s)** — by Dr. Matthew Walker. Fascinating book. Even one night of less than seven hours of sleep,
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=239s)** — you're going to have 50% more buildup of amyloid beta placking. How do we get more
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=244s)** — sleep? And another factor in getting quality sleep is the avoidance of alcohol. One cup of alcohol
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=249s)** — prevents a significant part of your REM sleep. You might feel like you're sleeping because it's
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=256s)** — a sedative, but you're not getting the quality of sleep. If you're drinking several times a
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=260s)** — week, this could be a huge problem with the quality of sleep. And also in the prevention of
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=265s)** — Alzheimer's, it could shut down growth hormone by 50%. It's an anti-aging hormone. It helps
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=269s)** — you lose weight. Alcohol is really bad for your brain. And we want to flood the brain with a lot
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=276s)** — of oxygen. How do we get oxygen in the brain? Exercise. Regular, consistent exercise hands down
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=282s)** — is one of the most important things to do to prevent Alzheimer's and other types of dementia.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=287s)** — People who are sedentary do not get the oxygen in the brain. Getting oxygen to the brain
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=291s)** — lessens something called hypoxia. That's a word that describes lack of oxygen. And with
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=296s)** — hypoxia, you get inflammation. When you exercise, you make the brain healthier. You grow brain cells
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=302s)** — and you stimulate something called BDNF, brain derived neurotrophic factor. That's like miracle
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=308s)** — growth for your brain. And there's also a tiny little mechanism deep in the brain that regulates
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=314s)** — the rhythm of your sleep. It's called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Not that you need to
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=320s)** — know that name, but that's what it is. And that thing is so important to regulate the
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=324s)** — A couple ways to get that working is during the daylight, get a lot of sun and then start to go
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=330s)** — to bed when it gets dark. Vitamin D in higher amounts can reset that mechanism. I would
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=335s)** — recommend taking about 20,000 international units of vitamin D. And then there's also
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=340s)** — the fuel that you feed the brain. If you're living on carbohydrates and sugar, you're
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=344s)** — going to create a starvation on the nerve cells. You really want to put your brain in
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=349s)** — state of ketosis. The brain cells love ketones. How do you get into ketosis? You lower your
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=357s)** — carbohydrate. If you have signs of dementia, I would highly recommend that you take ketones
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=364s)** — as a supplement. And you also take on a regular basis, MCT oil, because MCT oil
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=370s)** — can turn into ketones and feed the brain directly. We want to flood that brain with
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=375s)** — ketones. As far as nutrition goes, I think out of all the nutrients, niacin is going to be very
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=381s)** — important for the brain. I would start out maybe with 50 milligrams for a period of time, then go
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=387s)** — to a hundred milligrams per day, and then eventually up to 500 milligrams per day. You
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=392s)** — got to do it slowly because some people can't tolerate the flushing response. I kind of like
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=397s)** — the flushing response. It's not dangerous. It just will create a vasodilation effect.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=401s)** — Since we're on the topic of sleep, if you want to take your sleep to the next level,
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHNOAvhkr5Q&t=405s)** — you should watch this video right here. Check it out.
