- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=0s)** — So I'm always researching different body problems.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=3s)** — And I've done several videos on gout and uric acid.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=7s)** — And I found a remedy that I think you should know about if you have gout.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=11s)** — We take a look at the mechanism of how certain gout medications work.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=17s)** — Most of them work by inhibiting an enzyme that goes from purine into uric acid.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=23s)** — Okay. So they block this enzyme called xanthine oxidase.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=27s)** — So of course the question is, is there any natural thing that can do the same thing?
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=32s)** — And the answer is yes.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=35s)** — I'm assuming that you know that you have to get off alcohol, beer, fructose, right?
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=40s)** — To help get rid of this condition.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=42s)** — But there's a lot of people who do that that still have gout.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=45s)** — And gout can be devastating, especially trying to walk because it affects your foot.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=50s)** — I mean, it can affect the entire body because you're limping and shuffling along.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=54s)** — And all because of this one joint in your toe.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=58s)** — Humans have lost the enzyme to help break down uric acid.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=63s)** — What have we gained?
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=65s)** — Well, we've gained a survival mechanism to help us store fat during times of starvation,
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=71s)** — which is probably not exciting you, but that's what happened.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=75s)** — But I don't want to get into that topic.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=77s)** — I want to just get into this natural remedy that is quite fascinating.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=81s)** — And that remedy is a plant chemical, let's say polyphenol, called sulfurophane.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=87s)** — Maybe you've heard of this from the work of John Hopkins,
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=91s)** — where they did studies and found that it helps with cancer.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=94s)** — And they try to get the patents on broccoli sprouts.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=96s)** — They couldn't get it.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=97s)** — And so they apparently dropped it like hot potato because you don't see a lot of research by them in this area.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=102s)** — Apparently, if you can't patent it, that organization is not going to invest a lot of money into promoting it,
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=107s)** — because it's something that anyone can actually grow in their garden.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=110s)** — Broccoli sprouts, but you can also get them in pill form, but they're mostly in broccoli sprouts and radish sprouts.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=117s)** — There's several interesting things about sulfurophane.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=119s)** — Number one, its bioavailability.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=123s)** — I mean, it really gets absorbed way more than any other polyphenol.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=128s)** — It has like an 80% bioavailability.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=131s)** — Look at the chart that I have up here.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=133s)** — Silly Marin, 0.73% bioavailable.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=138s)** — Curcumin, that's in the temeric, right?
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=140s)** — 1% bioavailability.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=142s)** — Quercetin, which is only 4% sulfurophane, 80%.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=147s)** — So apparently it goes in the body like a rocket ship.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=150s)** — There's not a lot of barriers.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=151s)** — Another thing that's really interesting about the sulfurophane is that it has the ability to activate other genes and enzymes
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=162s)** — to get rid of poisons in the body and to take a poisonous carcinogen and turn it into something that's no longer cancer causing.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=169s)** — It can activate over a hundred defense genes, genes that protect itself against certain things.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=177s)** — But relating to gout, these studies were not done on humans.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=180s)** — However, it's definitely worth it to try it out.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=183s)** — And the cool thing about it is that the side effects are virtually nil compared to medications.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=191s)** — So they found that it helps restore the nephron.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=194s)** — This is the kidney cell's ability to filter because uric acid is made by our body and filtered out through the kidneys.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=204s)** — So many times a person will have a problem at the kidney level and the kidneys are not able to deal with this uric acid and they just kind of dump it into the tissues.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=215s)** — So sulfurophane helps this filter filter better.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=221s)** — It also helps up regulate antioxidants to help reduce free radical damage, which relates to reducing inflammation.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=232s)** — I mean, just think about these crystals that are forming in your big toe and how much free radical damage that's going on.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=240s)** — Massive. It's a war with your immune system.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=243s)** — So sulfurophane helps to regulate the reaction of the immune system to the crystals and the inflammation from many different angles.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=254s)** — It also increases microbial diversity, which can also take a load of this uric acid out of your body because your microbes help to dismantle and degrade uric acid.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=266s)** — So sulfurophane looks very promising. It's not that expensive.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=270s)** — Virtually zero side effects and it could be just that missing puzzle piece that you've been looking for.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K114ptQ1oUQ&t=276s)** — Now, if you haven't seen my other video on uric acid and gout, I put it up right here. Check it out.
