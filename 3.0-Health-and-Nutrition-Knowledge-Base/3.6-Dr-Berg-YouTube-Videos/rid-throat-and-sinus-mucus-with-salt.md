- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=0s)** — So if you have any type of... excuse me one second... oh man... any problem with mucus in your throat,
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=8s)** — today we're going to talk about how to get rid of it using salt. Very, very simple. This is part of
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=13s)** — a series of three different videos to address this problem from different angles. So whether
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=17s)** — you have a sinus mucus or mucus in the inner ear or coming from your tonsils or up from the
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=25s)** — we're going to get into it. So I'm not sure if you know this, but salt is really good for anything
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=31s)** — bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mold. Even if you think about how they cure meat, they add salt to
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=40s)** — actually raw meat to stop any type of bacterial growth. And even when you make sauerkraut,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=45s)** — you have this bacteria that is fermenting this cabbage, but then when they want to stop it,
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=49s)** — they add salt to it. Then it stabilizes this stage of making sauerkraut. I want to explain
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=55s)** — what salt does to these microbes. Okay, if we take a look at my little chart right here,
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=61s)** — if we put salt on either a bacteria, a fungus, a yeast, or a mold, the salt concentration is a
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=69s)** — lot more outside than inside, right? Inside you have water, and water tends to flow towards
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=76s)** — a concentrated salt mixture. So the water is going to move out of the cell
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=83s)** — into the extracellular area right here, turning this bacteria into a shriveled, dehydrated,
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=91s)** — dead particle. So the salt will kill bacteria, fungus, mold, and yeast through dehydration.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=102s)** — Another cool thing that the salt will do is it'll thin mucus. So a lot of times people get this
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=109s)** — really thick mucus that won't come out of their bodies. Well, you can use salt to loosen it up.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=115s)** — How does it do that? The same mechanism. It takes the water out of the mucus, it breaks it
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=120s)** — up, and it thins the mucus. So we have two things going on. We have the inhibiting of the
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=125s)** — microbial growth and the killing of microbes, and we also have the thinning of the mucus. So
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=129s)** — this is really good for an infection anywhere in your respiratory tract. You could have a
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=134s)** — post-nasal sinus drip situation. That's leaking down into the back part of the sinuses into the
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=140s)** — throat. You could also have a situation where there's an ear infection and there's mucus
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=147s)** — buildup through the estation tubes on either side, and that can end up in the throat as
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=151s)** — well. And so here you are trying to get rid of the throat infection, but it keeps coming
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=155s)** — from the ear. So the source is the ear, the effect is the throat. So you have to be able to
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=161s)** — handle where it's originating from. And also if it's in the sinuses, you have to handle that
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=165s)** — as well. So this mucus can be originating from the sinus, from the ear, or even from
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=172s)** — the tonsils, which are little immune glands in the back part of the throat, which can swell
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=179s)** — up, especially in children, and be a source of infection. But really the tonsils are
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=185s)** — any invading of the microbes deeper into the body. So it intends to create defenses,
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=192s)** — and it creates inflammation, and a lot of times you'll end up with a sore throat. On occasion,
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=198s)** — some of the mucus could be coming up from the esophagus, because you have either
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=203s)** — acid reflux that's irritating the esophagus, or you could have some mucus that's coming up
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=208s)** — from the lungs. So there's many different things that you can do related to salt,
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=213s)** — from very expensive to very inexpensive. So let's start with the least expensive thing you can do.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=219s)** — You can basically take a teaspoon of sea salt. Now as far as the salt that I recommend, I
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=223s)** — don't recommend using table salt, because they have so many additives in their anti-caking
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=228s)** — agents, and you really don't know the source of where they got that refined product. I would
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=234s)** — highly recommend you find a good rock salt, something that has been preserved, that hasn't
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=240s)** — been exposed to plastics and pollution in our oceans. A lot of times people will use Himalayan
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=246s)** — sea salt, but I will mention if you're going to use one of the therapies that I'm going to
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=251s)** — recommend, I think usually when you buy one of these units, which I'm going to explain,
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=255s)** — it comes with its own rock salt. And so in that case, you maybe you don't want to put
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=259s)** — Himalayan sea salt, because that does have a bit more iron, but certain units also just
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=264s)** — use sodium chloride. So let's say for example, you're not going to get those units,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=268s)** — you're just going to use some sea salt. Himalayan sea salt is a really good one. What you're going
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=273s)** — to do is you're going to take a teaspoon of the sea salt and dissolve it in a glass of water,
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=279s)** — and you're going to drink that down. Just by drinking it down, you're going to expose
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=283s)** — everything in your mouth and the throat area to this salt. Plus, the salt is going to go
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=287s)** — inside the body and strengthen something called the autonomic nervous system, which especially
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=292s)** — focuses in on this fight or flight mechanism. It tends to improve that. So many people will
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=298s)** — think that it results just from drinking some salt water. So you want to heat up the water to a certain
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=303s)** — degree so you can dissolve the salt in there. So you have the option of drinking it or using it
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=308s)** — as something you can gargle with. Right? So you just you drink this salt water, you gargle it,
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=313s)** — get the back of your throat all exposed to this sea water, and you're going to start to
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=318s)** — improve your immune system because it's going to kill off the microbe and start loosening up
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=321s)** — this mucus. So salt water gargles are great. But just remember, when you gargle with this,
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=328s)** — make sure you dilute the salt in the water. You may want to also add a teaspoon of apple cider
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=334s)** — vinegar. I like Fairchild's because it's a little more concentrated and it's more pure.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=339s)** — But apple cider vinegar changes the pH and it kills microbes as well. So we're not only
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=347s)** — going to dehydrate the microbes, thin the mucus, but we can actually also kill the microbes
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=353s)** — by adding this apple cider vinegar, which is acetic acid. Now, I'm not telling you to put
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=358s)** — this straight concentrated acid into your body because that's going to irritate, especially if
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=363s)** — you have a sore throat. You want to dilute it like one teaspoon in a glass of water to make
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=369s)** — it more diluted. But both salt and apple cider vinegar works really good for an antibacterial
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=377s)** — effect as well as an anti-inflammatory effect. The next thing you have an option to do is get a
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=383s)** — neti pot. A neti pot is something called a nasal irrigation in which you're going to pour some
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=390s)** — salt water up into your sinuses through here and it's going to come out the other side over
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=395s)** — the sink. So the reason I like that is that you're using this diluted salt water and it's
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=407s)** — going to come out the other side over the sink. So you're going to get a lot of mucus and you
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=408s)** — will notice that when you blow your nose a lot of mucus will come out. If you have a post-nasal
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=413s)** — drip all year round, suspect a fungal infection or some type of mold growing in your
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=419s)** — sinuses because that would indicate it's not seasonal. And hopefully you're going to change
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=423s)** — your diet and come off any sugar because sugar feeds this mold and candida and fungus.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=429s)** — You'd probably want to do like a nasal irrigation neti pot maybe every other day until it's
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=435s)** — completely settled down. The problem with some people is they get their sinuses scraped out
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=440s)** — and they might get surgery and now they damage this very delicate layer of skin that has all
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=446s)** — these good bacteria to protect you against pathogens. So in another video I talked about
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=452s)** — using a drop of diluted kimchi juice and a little cotton swab to add that microbiome
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=458s)** — to the sinuses to give you relief. There's some great data on that. Now the next thing you can do
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=464s)** — is use a humidifier which basically turns a liquid into a vapor. And so you would use this
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=468s)** — while you're sleeping. You turn it on, you put your salt water in there, and you let it
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=473s)** — run all night long. So you can actually breathe this into your body, into your lungs,
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=478s)** — and it can help to thin the mucus. One more thing I would recommend is to really bundle up
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=482s)** — and get warm when you're in bed because a lot of times these infections, especially if
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=487s)** — it's in the lower part of the respiratory area or even the higher part, the upper respiratory,
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=493s)** — that can be viral and so antibiotics don't work. And so you want to heat your body up
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=499s)** — and generate more like a natural fever. So you want to bundle up, get in your bed, stay warm,
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=505s)** — and try to sweat so you can cook these viruses with temperature. And so we're going to
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=509s)** — kill them with dehydration, kill them with an acid, kill them with heat. And then the next
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=515s)** — thing you can do is what's called halotherapy, which is a couple options. You can actually go
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=520s)** — somewhere and they have these salt caves that you can go in. Or there's halotherapy machines,
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=526s)** — which basically are like a dry salt machine that puts this dry salt out into the air.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=531s)** — And they usually come with their own type of salt, which is purified sodium chloride. And I
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=536s)** — don't think they use sea salts. They may. I'm not sure. But these halotherapy machines
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=541s)** — are a little bit more expensive. So if you can afford one, they might be worth it. Now,
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=546s)** — let's say, for example, you do this and it's just not working. It could be the source of
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=551s)** — your infection is coming from an ear infection or some type of microbe in the estation tubes,
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=556s)** — which can get really clogged up. For that, you have several options. You can just take a
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=561s)** — drop of this seawater and put it about four drops or five drops in each ear. Let it go in
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=567s)** — kind of shake it out. And what that will do, it'll create a thinning of the mucus through here
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=573s)** — and co-opt those microbes. You can also do the same thing with diluted apple cider vinegar,
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=578s)** — not concentrated, just a few, like maybe four or five drops of that diluted apple cider vinegar
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=584s)** — in the water, one teaspoon per glass. And you would put that in each year. So you have
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=589s)** — different options of things you can do based on your feeling comfortable about it. There's
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=597s)** — drop of garlic oil in each year. That works really well. It kills the microbe and allows
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=603s)** — this thing to clear out. And of course, you also have this acid reflux thing. If that is the
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=609s)** — problem, you have to watch my video down below on how to get rid of acid reflux. But
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=614s)** — you're going to know if you have acid reflux because you're going to have digestive issues.
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=618s)** — You might have heartburn. You might feel it indigestion down here. Typically, this is not
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=624s)** — going to be the issue. It's mainly going to be either coming from the sinuses or even the
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=629s)** — tonsils. So the gargling will really help. Now, on top of all of this, I would highly recommend
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=635s)** — you take vitamin D. There's a large amount of data on the relationship between kids that have
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=641s)** — enlarged tonsils and a vitamin D deficiency, kids and adults that have sinus allergies,
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=647s)** — sinus mucus and low vitamin D, ear infections, okay, and people with vitamin D deficiencies.
- **[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=654s)** — And so just the fact that vitamin D receptors are in every single cell in your body,
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=659s)** — including almost every single immune cell, it makes sense to take vitamin D and probably
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=664s)** — at least 20,000 IUs. One little extra strategy that I would use instead of taking
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=671s)** — regular doses of vitamin D for something like this is I would just take 50,000 IUs of vitamin D
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=679s)** — once a week. That way you get this shotgun effect and you can actually speed up the
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=685s)** — clearing of this mucus. Now, if you haven't seen how to get rid of respiratory mucus
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfSBFPBAl4&t=689s)** — with salt, you have to check that video out. I put it up right here.
