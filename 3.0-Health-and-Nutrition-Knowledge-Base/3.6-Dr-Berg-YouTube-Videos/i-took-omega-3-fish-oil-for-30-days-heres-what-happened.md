- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=0s)** — What would happen if you consume fish oils, Omega 3 fatty acids, for about a month, 30 days?
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=5s)** — Very interesting things. So let's do a deep dive into this topic. Many people get their Omega 3
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=9s)** — fatty acids from fish oils. Other people get them from cod liver oil. The difference is that cod
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=16s)** — liver oil has some additional things, vitamin A and vitamin D. But both of them have Omega 3
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=22s)** — fatty acids. So let's dive right in, starting with the brain. 25% of all the fat in your brain
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=27s)** — is that specific DHA type of fat. And most of it is in the frontal cortex, the part of the brain
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=35s)** — that supports memory, focus, concentration, attention. So specifically DHA supports the
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=43s)** — integrity of the membrane around the neurons. So what does that mean, integrity of the
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=49s)** — membranes? Well, in the membrane around the neurons, you have a lot of things happening. You
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=53s)** — have these little pumps that allow communication to go back and forth. You have protection against
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=58s)** — that neuron from various things. And one thing about the brain is you do not want inflammation
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=62s)** — in the brain. Now I will point out that your body can make DHA. It can make some, not much.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=69s)** — And it gets it from other foods that actually can be converted into DHA. And that precursor
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=75s)** — or substance is called ALA. And that's in walnuts, that's in chia seed, flax seed. But
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=81s)** — conversion is very, very small. So unless a person consumes something from the sea,
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=85s)** — chances are they're not going to get a lot of DHA. DHA supports the retina. The retina is
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=92s)** — neurological tissue in the back part of the eye that picks up information from the environment
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=96s)** — and it pulls it into the brain. It has little photoreceptors and 60% of all the fat in that
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=102s)** — retina is DHA. So it's very, very important. It's important to protect you against inflammation.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=107s)** — It's important to UV radiation and protect against macular degeneration. Then you have these omega
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=113s)** — 3 fatty acids in your skin. It makes the skin real smooth. It protects the skin against things
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=118s)** — like acne, psoriasis, eczema, dry skin, red skin, as well as ultraviolet light. Now we need
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=126s)** — a certain amount of ultraviolet light to help make vitamin D. But really only one tenth of
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=131s)** — spectrum of UV light is designated for making vitamin D. The rest of the UV can create problems
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=138s)** — for our body, but omega 3 can protect our skin from UV radiation. There's even association
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=143s)** — between DHA omega 3 fatty acids and your bones helping to mineralize bone, decrease the risk
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=151s)** — of osteoporosis. A lot of people take omega 3 fatty acids to help with arthritis in the
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=160s)** — liver, which can then turn into scar tissue. So it helps all three problems with the liver.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=167s)** — Scar tissue, inflammation, and fat in the liver. Another benefit of fish oil is to help balance
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=172s)** — out your blood sugars, specifically making insulin more sensitive. Because so many people
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=177s)** — have insulin resistance and they have pre-diabetes and diabetes, omega 3 fatty acids
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=181s)** — can help turn that around. Now there's also another interesting connection between insulin
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=186s)** — and omega 3 fatty acids. You need insulin to allow these fatty acids to go in the body.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=191s)** — But when you have insulin resistance, the cells actually have a deficiency of insulin and that
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=196s)** — alone can actually inhibit the amount of omega 3 going into the cell. That's all the problems
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=200s)** — that people have when they have insulin resistance with inflammation. Because if you're
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=204s)** — not able to absorb omega 3 fatty acids, your inflammatory markers will go higher. And then
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=210s)** — we have the very important purpose of supporting the inside of the arteries, keeping the
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=215s)** — inflammation very, very low. So you don't develop calcium deposits or cholesterol
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=220s)** — formation in the arteries. People that have asthma and allergies can benefit from fish oils
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=225s)** — as well. It's been known to help reduce those symptoms. And then of course we have all the
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=229s)** — reproductive benefits. Supporting the survival of sperm. Also supporting the egg that's
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=234s)** — released from the ovary. So omega 3s are very important in increasing fertility
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=238s)** — and also supplying some really important raw material for this baby that's growing inside the
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=245s)** — mother. And even if you're sore after exercise, omega 3 fish oils can help you get rid of that
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=250s)** — inflammation and speed up the repair process. Now a couple problems with fish oils. Number one,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=256s)** — don't go on price. You're going to get something that's probably rancid, something
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=259s)** — that's already oxidized. Much of the fish oil that's sold ends up going through China
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=265s)** — in the processing of these fish oils. So you really lose control of the supply chain and don't
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=270s)** — really know what's happening at that level. And of course manufacturing companies use China
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=275s)** — because you can get a much cheaper product. The other thing to worry about with fish oils is
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=280s)** — contamination with heavy metals. Lead, arsenic, mercury. So it's really important to know the
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=286s)** — source of where your omega 3 fatty acids come from. Is that part of the ocean clean? Is it
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=292s)** — healthy? You'd be surprised. Some of the top brands, I mean it's like it's the worst quality
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=297s)** — you could possibly get. You end up burping and belching and you can just taste the
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=302s)** — acidity of that oil. Now I will say that fish oil or cod liver oil is going to taste a little
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=307s)** — bit like fish. But there's a huge difference between rancid fish oil and just fish oil.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=313s)** — And also on the flip side, if it has absolutely no fish smell or taste at all,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=317s)** — you might not even be getting actual fish oil. But I think the best way to take it is in a
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=323s)** — pearl so you can swallow it. So there are options. Plus you can get your omega 3 fatty
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=327s)** — acids from consuming fatty fish. Wild caught salmon, herring, mackerel, sardines, shellfish.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=334s)** — There's even omega 3 fatty acids in grass-fed animal products, grass-fed cheese, grass-fed
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=341s)** — yogurt. But personally I get my omega 3s from cod liver oil because it has additional vitamin D
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aj0UTxmmv4&t=346s)** — and vitamin A. And for more information about cod liver oil, I put this video up right here.
