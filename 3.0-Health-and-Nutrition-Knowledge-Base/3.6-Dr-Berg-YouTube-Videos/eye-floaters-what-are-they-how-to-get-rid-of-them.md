- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=0s)** — I have some very valuable information on floaters and how to get rid of floaters.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=5s)** — The most important thing you need to understand about floaters is what are floaters in the first
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=11s)** — place. Okay? Like you have these little worm-like things floating in your eyes that really probably
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=16s)** — are irritating you. Some of you have them and you got used to them so it doesn't bother you.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=21s)** — What is a floater for real? Is it just some broken collagen protein that just kind of
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=27s)** — floating around? And it's basically this. You have this accumulation of this collagen fiber
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=33s)** — in a certain form that is damaged from... and I'm going to give you a new word here. It's been
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=40s)** — glycated. What does that mean? It means that it's stuck to a sugar molecule. So when you connect
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=45s)** — a protein to a sugar or a sugar to a fat, it gets stuck. Now that protein becomes
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=53s)** — unavailable and it kind of clogs up the body. Well, that's what these eye floaters are.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=58s)** — The official name is Advanced Glycation N Products. Just picture you're in an ocean
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=65s)** — and you see this jellyfish, right? And it's floating along and you can kind of see right
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=69s)** — through it because it's translucent. And this jellyfish happens to be eating all these little
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=74s)** — sugary treats, right? And all the sugar is kind of like binding with this gel, okay,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=80s)** — this jellyfish, and it's making these little worm-like structures, which are basically the
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=87s)** — connection of that collagen to that sugar. So it makes it cloudy. In the eye, you have this
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=94s)** — called vitreous gel, which is basically a translucent, you can see through it,
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=99s)** — a protein of collagen. And so when you lose your protective mechanism, which are antioxidants,
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=105s)** — this glycation starts to occur, especially if you're on a high carb diet. Now, here's a question.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=113s)** — Is there anything that can get rid of this? Okay. And the answer is yes. There are many things
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=119s)** — that you can do or take that are considered anti-glycation. In other words, they prevent
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=125s)** — this binding of the sugar to the protein. One reference that I found called the PDR. Now,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=131s)** — not in the current versions, it's in the older versions. They have a natural remedy for eye
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=137s)** — floaters. And all three of these remedies create an anti-glycation effect. So that would be
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=143s)** — choline, inositol, and methionine. So you would take choline in a thousand milligrams per day.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=151s)** — That's one gram. You would take inositol, 500 milligrams each day. And then with methionine,
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=157s)** — you would only need 200 milligrams. So that is the ratio that was advised years ago in the
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=163s)** — physician's desk reference. Now, I found a lot of other research on this topic that you can
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=169s)** — also add to this mixture. One being L-lysine, which is another amino acid that's been very,
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=176s)** — very promising in creating significant improvement in eye floaters. And I would add one to three
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=184s)** — grams, depending how bad your floaters are. And this mixture, I would recommend to take
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=190s)** — an empty stomach, because that way it won't interfere with other proteins. If you then add
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=196s)** — intermittent fasting, and maybe even some prolonged fasting to this protocol,
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=201s)** — I think it would greatly speed it up. But I will say that this remedy does take a bit of
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=205s)** — time. It takes some months for it to work. But with the fasting, I think you'll see some
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=209s)** — results within weeks. The other advice I'm going to recommend is to start to cut down
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=215s)** — your sugar. I'm talking about going on a low carb diet. And the name for that is the
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=220s)** — ketogenic diet. So you'd want to add that as well. Because if you take a look at a diabetic,
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=226s)** — usually has higher amounts of sugar, they have much greater incidence of having these
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=231s)** — floaters than a non-diabetic. And when you do keto, you want to do the healthy version
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=235s)** — of keto because of the antioxidants. We want more antioxidants. So vegetables with high vitamin C
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=242s)** — would be very helpful. Also meats and seafood that are loaded with zinc. Zinc can also help
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=247s)** — give you an anti-glycation effect. Now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=252s)** — algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's a
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VxmoMbD-4&t=257s)** — lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately. So to make sure you have full
