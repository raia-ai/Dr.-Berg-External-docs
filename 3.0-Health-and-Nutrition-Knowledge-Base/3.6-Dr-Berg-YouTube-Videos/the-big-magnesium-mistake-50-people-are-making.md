- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=0s)** — The big mistake most people are making regarding magnesium. Your blood levels show normal magnesium levels.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=7s)** — What a lot of people don't know is only 1% of all your magnesium in your body is inside your blood.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=12s)** — 99% is deep in your cells. When your body is deficient in magnesium, it will rob magnesium from your bone, your muscle, and put it in the blood.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=20s)** — Giving you the illusion that you have enough magnesium if you are just relying on the blood test.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=25s)** — There are more sophisticated advanced ways to determine if you are magnesium deficient. But I am going to give you this simple way to figure it out.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=31s)** — If you have any muscle spasms in your body. Muscle twitch underneath the eyelid. Anxiety, poor sleep, sugar cravings, and definitely charlie horses.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=40s)** — Are all clues that you are deficient in magnesium. Typically with the diet you need about 400mg of magnesium every single day.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=46s)** — Almonds are high in magnesium, but you would have to consume 5 cups of almonds to get that 400mg.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=52s)** — Or you can get your magnesium from spinach, but you would have to consume 5 big handfuls of spinach just to get 400mg.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=61s)** — What about chocolate? Isn't that high in magnesium? It is sort of high, but you would still need about 4 bars of chocolate to get your daily amount of magnesium.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=68s)** — On top of that, there are many things that don't allow us to absorb even the magnesium from the food that you eat.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=74s)** — For example, if you have inflammation in the gut, that is going to greatly reduce your absorption rates by up to 60-70%.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=81s)** — Grains in your diet, refined foods like refined sugar, starches, that is depleting your magnesium.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=87s)** — And then other things will deplete your magnesium like alcohol, caffeine, and also many medications.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=92s)** — And of course the top selling magnesium products are not the best ones to take because not only do they create diarrhea,
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=99s)** — because they are laxative, but you really don't absorb much. Like with magnesium oxide, you only absorb 3-4%.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=104s)** — The one I would recommend is magnesium glycinate because that is the one that you absorb 80% and it doesn't create a laxative effect.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=112s)** — And the glycinate part of it will help you sleep. Magnesium is one of the master controllers over calcium.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=120s)** — You see calcium has other purposes other than just making your bones strong.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=124s)** — Calcium is also used in the body as the main communication signal between cells.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=130s)** — And far too often we accumulate too much calcium inside the cell.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=134s)** — And if there is too much calcium in the cell, those calcium crystals start damaging certain parts of the cell.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=140s)** — Literally we calcify as we get older. And you may have heard of the vitamin K2 being the antidote for that.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=149s)** — Because vitamin K2 helps to keep the calcium from accumulating in the arteries.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=153s)** — But magnesium is even more important in helping to regulate excess amounts of calcium.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=158s)** — Another thing that magnesium is really good at is preventing kidney stones.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=162s)** — It has 100 times more binding force to the oxalates than calcium.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=168s)** — And then let's talk about muscle. It's the calcium that causes muscle to contract and magnesium to relax.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=175s)** — So anytime you have a tight muscle, that means you have way too much calcium.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=180s)** — But really it's low magnesium. It's preventing heart attacks but also preventing any type of problem with the rhythm of the heart.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=188s)** — You can correct atrial fibrillation by taking enough magnesium over a period of time.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=192s)** — But sometimes it might take months before you really correct that deficiency.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=196s)** — You can't correct a very severe deficiency of magnesium by just taking the maintenance dose.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=203s)** — Sometimes you have to increase it to 1000 to 1500 or more milligrams every single day.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=211s)** — Over a period of months.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=213s)** — And this also includes dealing with things like migraine headaches, pain problems like fibromyalgia or pain syndromes.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=220s)** — They require a lot more magnesium. And also mood disorders, people that are depressed or even have diabetes.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=225s)** — Magnesium greatly helps blood sugar. Probably because of the demand that a high blood sugar situation creates on magnesium.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=233s)** — It depletes magnesium. So the requirement of magnesium is much higher for a diabetic.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=238s)** — Now let's get to the three secrets. Number one is we used to get a lot of our magnesium from hard water.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=246s)** — Whether it's from a spring, a well. And then we decided to filter the water like in city water.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=252s)** — Or send the water through a water softener which actually removes the calcium and magnesium and replaces it with sodium and potassium.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=259s)** — To make the water less corrosive on the piping and less harsh in washing your clothes.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=265s)** — People don't consume hard water anymore. In areas in the country where they don't soften the water, they have much less risk of getting heart attacks.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=273s)** — And then if you compare that with areas that do use a lot of water softeners, their risk of heart attacks go up.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=278s)** — Okay, secret number two. Vitamin D won't work without magnesium. If you're increasing your magnesium, also increase your vitamin D.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=286s)** — And that way they will both work. And just as one side note, vitamin B1, which is really important in reducing stress.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=293s)** — And gets depleted when you consume a lot of carbohydrates. That also is dependent on magnesium.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=299s)** — So when you take more B1, you need magnesium to allow that to work.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=302s)** — And then the last and most important secret. Magnesium has a super important role in some of your biochemistry.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=309s)** — Deep in the cell, you have all sorts of motors that do the work of the cell.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=314s)** — Like the one in the mitochondria that literally spins 200 to 400 times a second.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=321s)** — It generates ATP. ATP is the energy currency of the body. And so your energy levels, your fatigue is related to how much magnesium you have.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=332s)** — So yes, magnesium helps lower cortisol, helps you sleep, but it also gives you energy.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=337s)** — And if you have any type of fatigue, it could be because you're deficient in magnesium.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MUGEckqWsQ&t=340s)** — And because magnesium is so important, if you have not watched my other video, magnesium, I'll put it up right here. Check it out.
