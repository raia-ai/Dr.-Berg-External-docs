- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=0s)** — There's a really good indicator or clue for predicting heart attacks. Okay? And it's just
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=7s)** — looking at your earlobe. Yeah, a little crease in the bottom of your earlobe starting from where the
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=13s)** — hole is coming out 45 degrees as you see in this image right here. Go to the mirror right now.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=20s)** — Take a look to see if you have this. Pause the video. Come back. I'm going to tell you
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=25s)** — what this is all about and what to do if you have it. Alright, you're back. Okay, what is going on
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=31s)** — with this earlobe and what do you mean the crease on the ear? What happens when you have coronary
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=36s)** — artery disease or another name for that is cardiovascular disease is you lose blood flow
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=43s)** — usually through an artery to the heart muscle and this affects your entire body circulation.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=50s)** — You start losing collateral circulation. What is collateral circulation? Well, if your heart becomes
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=58s)** — obstructed in some way, you get collateral or extra circulation or extra arteries that start
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=64s)** — to branch out and serve as a plan B blood supply to the heart muscle. Those are collateral
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=70s)** — arteries. So, what happens when you get this chronic lack of blood flow to your heart? Okay,
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=75s)** — start losing circulation in the peripheral part of your body first. The earlobe is part of the
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=83s)** — periphery and without this blood supply to the tiny capillaries in your earlobes, you start
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=88s)** — losing elastin, connective tissue, cartilage, and it starts to wrinkle up. This little crease
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=97s)** — shows up in about 71% of everyone with coronary artery disease. But it's also
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=103s)** — found in other conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure. It's found in smokers,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=109s)** — but it's most commonly found with people with heart problems. Now, since heart attacks are
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=114s)** — the number one cause of death, you should know this indicator not just for yourself,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=120s)** — but for other people too. Because if you see this, you can let the person know they need
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=125s)** — to go get it checked out and they need to do something ASAP. Now, why the urgency? Well,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=130s)** — first symptom of a heart attack over 50% of the time is death. So there is no symptoms or
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=139s)** — warning signs. You just drop dead. So you want to pay attention and you want to use this clue
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=143s)** — as a prediction of what could happen. And also you should realize that this is not just
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=148s)** — happening in your earlobe. It's happening throughout the entire body. The arteries can
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=153s)** — become thicker. You can have a lot of oxidative stress and a loss of a lot of
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=158s)** — collateral circulation in your body. So very simply, there's four things you need to do
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=163s)** — immediately. Number one, you need to go on the healthy version of the ketogenic diet
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=168s)** — with intermittent fasting. There's just no options. You need to start that. It's going
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=172s)** — to help you tremendously. Number two, you want to start a regular routine exercise program.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=179s)** — That's going to flood the body with a lot more oxygen, including the heart,
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=183s)** — and you want to be consistent. And you pretty much want to keep this in
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=187s)** — for the rest of your life. The next thing I would recommend is something that's very,
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=190s)** — very important for the inside of your arteries and the heart muscle. And it's a type of
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=197s)** — vitamin E called tocotrinols. Tocotrinols is like 50 times stronger than tocopherols.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=204s)** — So when you buy tocotrinols, you don't want to get tocotrinols mixed with tocopherols.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=211s)** — You want to get just a pure tocotrinol mix or tocotrinol complex. That is going to drive
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=219s)** — oxygen to the heart muscle itself. And it's also going to protect the inside of the
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=224s)** — vascular system. It's one of the most potent antioxidants that you can get,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=229s)** — and it's especially good for the heart. It's also good for the liver as well.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=232s)** — It can actually slow down the progression of the fatty liver.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=236s)** — All right, the next thing is to start to increase the omega-3 fatty acids. And the best omega-3
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=242s)** — is the cod liver oil. It's better than fish oils because not only does cod liver oil have
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=248s)** — the omega-3 fatty acids, but it also has vitamin A and vitamin D, which are also
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=253s)** — important in many different things, including heart health. And the last thing I'm going
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=258s)** — to recommend is to make sure you take something called vitamin K2. That keeps the
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=264s)** — calcium from building up in the arteries. And you want to take vitamin K2 with vitamin D3.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=270s)** — So I just wanted to create this quick video to give you something really simple to use
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=275s)** — as a predictor. Now, if you have not seen my recent video that I just released on the worst
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=282s)** — food for the cardiovascular system, and by the way, it's not sugar, okay? There's something
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGXbg7FKpvg&t=289s)** — If you haven't seen that video, I put it up right here. Check it out.
