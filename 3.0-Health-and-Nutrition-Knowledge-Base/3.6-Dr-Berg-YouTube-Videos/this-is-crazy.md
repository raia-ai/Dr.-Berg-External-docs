- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=0s)** — And has a grocery store that looks like it's straight out of The Walking Dead. There's nothing
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=4s)** — left on the shelves except for the vegan section. And even in a natural disaster, people would rather
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=13s)** — die than eat fake meat foods, fake meat substitutes. What I'm going to share with
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=19s)** — you today is absolutely crazy. And I was shocked to hear about this. But when you hear about the
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=26s)** — trying to pass this bill that basically tags livestock for a reason that they say is just for
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=34s)** — the environment, it's to protect the animals from disease. But there's actually another motivation
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=39s)** — to this. You've got to hear the story. And today we have John Moody, who's a homesteader.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=44s)** — He knows a lot about it. He's personally experienced this area for years. So I brought
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=50s)** — him on to kind of explain to us what is going on because it involves you and I,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=55s)** — because it involves our food. So welcome, John. Thanks for being on here. Hey, good morning.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=62s)** — Good morning, John. Can you just give us a little brief overview of what's going on now
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=67s)** — with this bill they're trying to pass related to electronic identification of livestock?
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=74s)** — Animal Livestock Tracking ID goes way, way back in history. Started with branding animals out on
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=82s)** — open ranges. How do you know whose cow is whose? That's where branding originally came from,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=86s)** — being able to sort, keep track of cattle, know when they got sold at market, who gets
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=91s)** — paid for this cow. Very practical nitty gritty issue as a farmer. So branding was replaced as
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=97s)** — time went on by these ear tags that cattle now wear. So if you've ever seen a cattle in a
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=102s)** — field, see it got this big ear tag with a number and whatnot. That was like the updated version
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=107s)** — of branding, ear tagging cattle. And back in the 1990s, the government, USDA, FISUS,
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=115s)** — some of these agencies, along with the rise of the big beef industry, which is very different
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=122s)** — than the actual farmers, they wanted an even newer version of cattle tagging. They wanted
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=130s)** — electronic animal tagging that would allow them to know the exact number and location
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=138s)** — of all livestock animals all the time. Wow. And what was the apparent reason that they said
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=145s)** — that this is going to be good for everyone? Like so many government programs, it's sold
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=149s)** — under the idea of safety. So the government said, oh, we sometimes have disease outbreaks
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=157s)** — in animals and we need to be able to know where these animals were, where they came from,
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=162s)** — to quickly respond to when we have a significant disease outbreak. The irony there
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=170s)** — is Ireland in 2022 rolled out electronic ID under this guise. Well, we need this
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=179s)** — to track diseases and other things in our animals. Now, this is a country that as far
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=186s)** — as I'm aware has never ever, ever once had a significant animal. Have you ever been
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=191s)** — perusing the newspaper or listening to the nightly news? And it's Ireland epicenter of
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=198s)** — animal disease outbreak that rocks. So on the one hand, congresswoman Hageman and others
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=205s)** — have pointed out this idea we need a new system to deal with animal disease outbreaks
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=212s)** — has no evidence at all. We've never had an animal disease outbreak in America.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=217s)** — Get out of hand. No other country that's implemented this program has even had, you know,
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=225s)** — nationally, let alone globally, significant animal disease outbreaks.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=229s)** — I mean, even in Ireland, I think a year later, right, they announced the need to
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=234s)** — call which aka that means kill right? Yeah, 41,000 livestock because to me climate change
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=242s)** — targets, right? Yeah. And that's one of the, you know, what's really going on here.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=249s)** — When you look at what the industry is saying about this. And then what, you know, non
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=255s)** — governmental organizations, NGOs and what like are saying about this is, I think your listeners
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=261s)** — already well aware, there's been a huge push to get Americans in Western countries to eat less
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=268s)** — meat. Yep. You know, since we just had the hurricane, I always love there's this really
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=274s)** — funny man, my friends always post after natural disasters, and has a grocery store looks like
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=280s)** — it's straight out of the Walking Dead. There's nothing left on the shelves, except for the
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=289s)** — natural disaster people would rather die. Fake, fake meat foods, fake meat substitutes,
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=297s)** — the World Economic Forum, the World Health Organization, the United Nations,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=303s)** — listeners can easily go look up their push to get people to eat less meat. Yep. They want
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=311s)** — them to eat less meat because they say it's bad for us, which is ridiculous. They want us
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=315s)** — eat less meat because it's harmful to the environment, which to anybody who's ever been
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=320s)** — on a pastured cattle farm, versus any other type of environmental use of land would know how
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=327s)** — absolutely insane such a claim is. But the real reason they want us to eat less meat
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=333s)** — is because they want us to eat bugs, and they want us to eat plants. And nobody's doing it.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=340s)** — Yeah. No amount of propaganda, no amount of subsidization has successfully gotten a large
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=347s)** — number of Westerners to adopt a plant bug-based diet. So now in certain countries, they're
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=356s)** — using EID, RFID. And those are... that stands for electronic ID identification. Yeah. RFID was
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=365s)** — one of the earlier names for it, radio frequency identification. Now it's often being called EID,
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=371s)** — electronic identification of animals. And so in these countries, they'll roll it out under
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=376s)** — safety. And then lo and behold, within a few years, they're then using it for environmental
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=383s)** — reasons and trying to force farmers to radically reduce the number of livestock.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=389s)** — Because what will happen if we radically reduce the number of livestock?
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=394s)** — They have a solution waiting for us, but it's kind of like a... it's a little bit of a bait and
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=397s)** — switch. And I'm being sarcastic because it's a lot of bait and switch. They come in with this
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=403s)** — apparent, oh yeah, safety, we're going to protect the farmer. But these farmers are
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=408s)** — being wiped out. Right? What happened in Michigan? Michigan, I think it was around
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=414s)** — 2000, somewhere between 2007 and 11. I believe they implemented EID type tracking.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=421s)** — And a number of groups looked at the performance... what happened to the Michigan
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=426s)** — farm economy and farm base compared to states that did not require electronic
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=432s)** — tracking and stuff. And Michigan was just a nightmare. They lost significantly more farms.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=440s)** — I think it was over 4000 farms, wasn't it? Yeah, just a very, very large number of farms
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=445s)** — and you know, maybe this will help listeners. Why? Why would changing an ear tag
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=452s)** — cause you to lose more farmers? Yeah, because all of these things are more labor,
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=458s)** — more compliance, more cost that gets passed on to your farmer, which means at the end
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=465s)** — of the day, you eventually see this on your plate. You know, if farmers are forced to call
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=473s)** — animals under the guise of environmental reasons, or under the guise of eggs during
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=480s)** — coronavirus. Eggs went up in price, eggs still haven't came all the way back down.
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=486s)** — Well, why? Because there was forced calling of large numbers of chickens and whatnot.
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=492s)** — It's funny how they use even they use that word calling. I mean, it sounds benign.
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=497s)** — It's like, why don't you say killing? Yeah, one of the differences though,
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=500s)** — often when animals are called, they're not allowed to go into the food supply.
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=505s)** — When chicken houses are liquidated, that's literally the you know, so you'll have these
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=509s)** — large KFO chicken houses. If they get a disease in one of these houses, they quite literally
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=517s)** — liquidate the whole house. I think they use nitrogen gas or some other gas, and they gas
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=523s)** — the entire house, kill all of the chickens, and then bury them in a giant landfill hole,
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=529s)** — taking stuff out of the food supply to where people can no longer access it. This just
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=536s)** — happened to the Strong Sisters farm in Michigan. A number of months ago, they had pigs at a
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=542s)** — butcher in Indiana, and they went to pick up the pigs that had been slaughtered and dressed
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=549s)** — and whatnot. And I think they're going to take them to another facility then to be cut up,
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=554s)** — turned into sausage and other things. And health inspectors forced them to call those pigs.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=562s)** — They poured motor oil on the carcasses so that they could not go into the food supply.
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=569s)** — Incredible. Incredible. You know, what's so ironic is they're going after the key
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=578s)** — food that actually is probably the most healing food that you can eat is grass-fed red meat.
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=583s)** — And I find it very interesting. I mean, that's how I turn my health around. And so many others
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=588s)** — are using red meat to heal their bodies. And of course, out of all the things, yeah,
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=593s)** — we have to get rid of that. This is what I want to know. Like the tagging,
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=596s)** — does this also involve all livestock, even the big companies or just the small farms or
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=602s)** — just everyone? So the current version that's going to go into effect November 5th,
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=609s)** — there's some debate of what version it is at the moment. I was actually just talking with somebody
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=614s)** — this morning before you and I talked, because originally the rule was only going to apply to
- **[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=621s)** — STEERS traveling for interstate commerce. But last I heard they've already expanded on this
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=627s)** — rule. But to some extent, it doesn't matter what the current version they're rolling out is,
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=633s)** — back in the early 2000s, they told us what program they really want. It was called the
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=639s)** — National Animal Identification System, NACE. And it would require every farmer and homesteader in
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=648s)** — America to individually radio frequency ID tag every single livestock animal they have.
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=657s)** — Cattle, pork, chickens, lamb, goats, you just name it. The program came with a 1-800 phone
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=664s)** — number. The perennial question, why did the chicken cross the road? The USDA did not want
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=669s)** — to know why the chicken crossed the road, but you had 24 hours to report when and where the
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=675s)** — chicken crossed the road to the government or face, I believe it was a $500 fine per animal
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=682s)** — fence. Now what made this program really interesting though, is it exempted confinement
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=689s)** — animal feeding operations. No, no way. I mean, it logically makes sense. Why would you need
- **[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=697s)** — to track an animal that is trapped in a concrete barn and is never going anywhere its
- **[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=702s)** — entire life? Homesteaders, farmers and whatnot, we would have to do this. We would have to
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=709s)** — phone calls. We would have to keep very stringent records on all of our animals.
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=715s)** — Butchers would not be allowed to accept animals that do not have the upgraded animal
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=720s)** — ear tagging. But if you're a CAFO, well, your animals are never going anywhere anyway.
- **[12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=726s)** — So just tell us what CAFO stands for? Confined animal feeding operation. So this is where
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=733s)** — the vast majority of animals in America, the vast majority of beef is still born right where I'm
- **[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=740s)** — sitting on farms like mine. So the vast majority of beef in America starts somewhere like this.
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=746s)** — But then they're sold at auctions, which that'd be a whole other story for your listeners,
- **[12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=751s)** — the broken beef auction system, where you go to the auction house and there's 200, 300 sellers.
- **[12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=759s)** — And guess how many buyers show up to buy cattle? How many? One or two. Because why would the four
- **[12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=766s)** — or five big beef companies bid against each other? Why would they give farmers more money?
- **[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=773s)** — When, hey, you go to that auction, Tim, and Jeff, you go to this other auction and
- **[12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=779s)** — will never be bidding against each other. Wow. And so all this beef starts in places like
- **[13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=787s)** — here, but it goes through these auction houses and then the beef get relocated to these feed lots,
- **[13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=793s)** — which you're very familiar with and your listeners have heard of, where they will have
- **[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=798s)** — thousands and thousands of cattle basically sitting in mud pits, being fed nothing but
- **[13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=804s)** — corn and soy to quickly fatten them up until they run them through the processing facilities.
- **[13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=811s)** — Yeah. You know, pigs and chickens, though, are often raised their entire lives
- **[13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=818s)** — in enclosed barn structures. So animal housing units and other things, as they're called.
- **[13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=825s)** — In China, I want to say they were building something like a hundred thousand pig
- **[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=831s)** — confinement farming operation. It's like the size of a small city, this building that's going
- **[13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=838s)** — to house over 10,000 sows alone and then all of the piglets. Terrible. Yeah, I have two pigs
- **[14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=846s)** — and they get five acres. So that's a lot of space, a lot of exercise. This bill, they try
- **[14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=853s)** — to pass it a couple times, but with your persistence and help, you got it defeated.
- **[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=860s)** — But then you're saying it's coming up one more time to be voted on? Well, no. So this is
- **[14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=868s)** — actually the way the USDA is doing this. And this is just one of the problems with how these
- **[14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=873s)** — agencies operate. They can write what they call rules without a bill or law ever having been
- **[14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=880s)** — passed. So the NACE is a program created by the USDA out of thin air by them just basically
- **[14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=891s)** — grabbing a sheet of paper and some Crayola crayons and going, you got to put these tags on your
- **[14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=897s)** — animals. And so we have a bill in Congress and the Senate. It is Congresswoman Harriet
- **[15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=905s)** — Hageman's bill to stop the USDA from doing this. She has successfully stopped RFID,
- **[15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=914s)** — I think on two or three different occasions now, either through bills or through lawsuits.
- **[15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=920s)** — You know, in 2009, we stopped it through protests. And farmers like Wendell Berry and
- **[15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=927s)** — Joel Salatin and others saying, we're just not going to tag our animals. You'll have to take
- **[15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=933s)** — us to jail before we start throwing these tags on. Wow. Okay. So is this a national
- **[15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=939s)** — program or does it go state by state? This is national. So this is a national program
- **[15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=945s)** — from the USDA. And again, they've tried to get people to accept it this time
- **[15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=951s)** — by rolling back everything that's involved, which is why I've been out there sounding the
- **[15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=957s)** — fire alarm because their goal is to get people not to care as much because it's only
- **[16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=963s)** — interstate steers or maybe it's only interstate steers now and dairy cattle.
- **[16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=969s)** — But they've told us repeatedly for two decades, what they want is a universal livestock tracing
- **[16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=977s)** — system that gives them complete and total knowledge of location and numbers of every
- **[16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=984s)** — livestock animal in the nation. So what can an average person do about this? Because
- **[16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=992s)** — there's sometimes it's kind of hopeless and overwhelming. Well, the good news is it was
- **[16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=996s)** — the average people who stopped this program in 2009. The protests I went to for the USDA
- **[16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1004s)** — listening hearings for every one farmer that was there, there was 10 people eating. And
- **[16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1011s)** — that's why people like you are so important because the majority of your audience are eaters
- **[16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1017s)** — and they're just always like, well, I'm not a farmer. And that's why we need you
- **[17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1021s)** — to speak up for your farmers because America I think is now down to maybe only two or three
- **[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1029s)** — million farming households in the nation. Contrast that with just a hundred years ago,
- **[17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1038s)** — 50% of American households were farming households. Wow. Incredible. And now it's
- **[17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1045s)** — just two or three million total farming households are left. There's not enough
- **[17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1049s)** — farmers left to successfully push back anymore against basically the calling of the farmers
- **[17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1057s)** — themselves at this point. So, you know, your listeners, average people, it really starts with
- **[17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1064s)** — you buying your food directly from local farmers. That is one of the biggest things you
- **[17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1070s)** — can do is reallocate where you're spending your money. So your cows are no longer going
- **[17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1076s)** — through these feed lots and through all of these just atrocious systems and places.
- **[18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1083s)** — For helping stop RFID proper, you can call your Congress person or your Senator.
- **[18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1090s)** — Really it's best to call both and ask them to support Hageman's amendment that would stop
- **[18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1097s)** — the USDA from being able to require RFID tagging on animals of any kind. And so what we'll
- **[18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1103s)** — just in the description, we'll put this information specifically so they can remember it. But I think
- **[18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1108s)** — everyone needs to step up the table and do something about it because if we have
- **[18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1113s)** — a number of people do this, then they're not going to pass it or actually it's going to be
- **[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1118s)** — defeated. Yeah. And other things you can do, some farmers still don't even realize this is
- **[18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1124s)** — happening in November. The USDA did a very good... they learned from their mistakes previously
- **[18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1130s)** — where they'd announced this very broadly it was happening. So they would get a lot of pushback.
- **[18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1136s)** — This time they've been very, very quiet about the implementation of the program.
- **[19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1142s)** — Because they're like, well, it's just for one small type of animal. So this has really
- **[19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1148s)** — flown under the radar over the last year. So letting your farmer know that this is going
- **[19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1154s)** — letting butchers know this is going to happen and getting them on board with not complying.
- **[19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1162s)** — I've been able to get some butchering associations, homesteaders, farmers,
- **[19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1168s)** — non-compliance and your farmer knowing that you will support them if they don't comply
- **[19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1174s)** — is really, really crucial. Years ago when my buying club was rated,
- **[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1180s)** — one of the reasons I was willing to stand up to my state health department
- **[19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1184s)** — to protect people's access to food in Kentucky is I had people who said to me,
- **[19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1190s)** — if you will fight for this, even if it means you're going to jail, we'll make sure your
- **[19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1196s)** — wife and kids are taken care of while this happens. Your farmers need that kind of
- **[20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1200s)** — committed support to be willing to risk running afoul, you know, of the USDA.
- **[20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1206s)** — So there's also a seminar. There's I think there's two seminars. There's one in November,
- **[20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1212s)** — then there's one next year. Tell us about this seminar, what that's all about.
- **[20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1216s)** — Yeah. So years ago, Joel Saliton, you had him on your show a couple months ago.
- **[20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1220s)** — I think people loved it. Joel approached me about starting a conference to organize pushback
- **[20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1227s)** — against all of this regulation that makes accessing real food so hard and so expensive.
- **[20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1235s)** — And we named it the rogue food conference. So and our next one is in November, November,
- **[20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1242s)** — I think it's eighth and ninth in Dallas, Fort Worth. It's actually on the Fort Worth side,
- **[20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1248s)** — kind of north east, sorry, northwest side of the Dallas, Fort Worth area. And that church,
- **[20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1253s)** — beautiful church, beautiful location. And the theme is going to be come and tag it.
- **[20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1259s)** — And so the theme is people coming together to work together, not just to stop RFID,
- **[21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1266s)** — but to really remind the government that we get to decide what we eat and who it comes from.
- **[21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1272s)** — Years ago, there was a lawsuit that was filed against the federal government
- **[21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1277s)** — over the interstate ban on the sale of raw milk. So there's supposedly an interstate ban
- **[21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1285s)** — on transporting raw milk across state lines for sale. No law was ever passed for this, by the
- **[21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1292s)** — way. This is once again, some government agency, some government bureaucrat grabbing colored
- **[21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1298s)** — pencils and making law out of thin air. Some people sued over this interstate ban on the sale
- **[21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1305s)** — of raw milk. The government's response to this lawsuit is startling. If you've never seen
- **[21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1312s)** — it, I'll send it to you afterwards because you might want to just read it to your listeners
- **[21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1315s)** — sometimes. But in this response, they say things like, there is no fundamental right
- **[22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1323s)** — to choose what you eat or what you feed your family. There is no fundamental right to food.
- **[22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1333s)** — They went point by point basically to saying, we are the final arbiter of what food is and
- **[22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1340s)** — we're the final decider of who you can get food from. Wow, that's totally 100,000% insane. That
- **[22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1347s)** — is crazy. I'll have to put the link down below so people can read that. And also,
- **[22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1354s)** — we'll put the link for this seminar in November. Is it October or November? November,
- **[22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1360s)** — November 8th and 9th, Dallas, Fort Worth. So rogue food conference, come and tag it.
- **[22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1366s)** — And then we're going to be down in Florida in March, doing a rogue health and wellness in
- **[22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1372s)** — Florida for people who need some vitamin D come deep winter. Yeah. Yeah. So and then just
- **[23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1381s)** — as a side note, I just think this is fascinating. Tell the listeners what happened
- **[23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1387s)** — to you. You got raided and how you overcame that raid. Yeah. So it was Memorial Day weekend,
- **[23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1394s)** — 2011. This was at the height of the government shutting down raw milk farmers, local food
- **[23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1403s)** — buying clubs, you know, basically anybody who was a little too successful at local food.
- **[23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1411s)** — The government went on a decades long rampage trying to shut them down, put them in jail,
- **[23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1419s)** — find them out of existence. So you can go on YouTube, see the video footage of raw some
- **[23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1426s)** — food co-op in California. So this is like total hippie California people. And
- **[23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1433s)** — all of these police and SWAT people are running through raw some co-op with guns drawn
- **[23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1439s)** — as if the hippies and the kale are going to shoot back. Right. Just totally absurd things.
- **[24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1445s)** — So we were raided and served cease and desist and quarantine orders Memorial Day weekend, 2011.
- **[24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1453s)** — Up until that point, pretty much everybody who'd been raided or faced the government had
- **[24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1459s)** — been shut down or lost. And we were just really, really fortunate that all of my
- **[24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1464s)** — buying club members almost like 90% of the members were all willing to go to jail with me.
- **[24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1470s)** — Wow. And so my strategy for beating the Kentucky health department was pretty simple.
- **[24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1477s)** — I look really bad in prison stripes. And so if I'm going to jail, I'm going to jail with
- **[24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1484s)** — friends. And so I took two sheets of paper on one sheet of paper. I typed up the pertinent
- **[24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1492s)** — sections of the Kentucky state constitution. And then on the second sheet of paper,
- **[24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1498s)** — I put a simple line at the top and it said, I be undersigned in accord with my God given
- **[25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1505s)** — in Kentucky constitutional rights and taking my milk from my cows.
- **[25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1512s)** — And if anyone at the Kentucky State Department of Health would like to talk with me about this,
- **[25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1518s)** — they can reach me at the name and phone number below. I put these two sheets of paper
- **[25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1522s)** — right next to the cease and desist and quarantine orders. Because I wanted people
- **[25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1527s)** — to know that cease and desist and quarantine orders are real credible threats. It was something
- **[25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1532s)** — like a minimum of 30 to 90 days in jail for breaking a cease and desist and quarantine order,
- **[25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1538s)** — a minimum of five to $10,000 in fines. So I didn't want to dupe people into doing this.
- **[25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1546s)** — I wanted them to fully know like, if you sign this with me, this is what they're
- **[25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1552s)** — threatening us over milk. So I put the cease and desist and quarantine orders,
- **[25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1556s)** — I put these sheets of paper, and we had like 90% of our members choose to break the quarantine
- **[26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1563s)** — and take their milk anyway. So then I went on a media campaign to make the Kentucky Health
- **[26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1572s)** — Department look really, really bad. You know, because like I live in Kentucky, I always
- **[26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1582s)** — roughly 80% of all smokers of America who are left smoking still live in Kentucky.
- **[26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1587s)** — And 100% of them seem to live in my county. We have a gas station just up the road from my
- **[26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1593s)** — farm. And it almost seems like a lot of my neighbors exclusively eat breakfast, lunch,
- **[26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1599s)** — and dinner out of that gas station diner. You look at the data on health, especially in
- **[26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1607s)** — these, you know, these southern central states, it's terrifying. So I would go on radio shows and
- **[26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1615s)** — other places and I'd just be like, I don't understand why the health department is spending
- **[27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1621s)** — all of this energy on people who are desperately trying to be healthy,
- **[27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1627s)** — desperately trying to raise healthy families, while Kentucky literally has a smoking,
- **[27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1633s)** — opioid, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer epidemic.
- **[27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1641s)** — And so I just asked this question to get people thinking about like,
- **[27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1647s)** — why does the government spend an inordinate amount of time and money
- **[27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1651s)** — trying to make it so hard for people to access healthy food?
- **[27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1655s)** — Right. It's like, it's almost as if they want to make us sick. And again, being very
- **[27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1662s)** — sarcastic. What was the final thing of that story? What happened? Yeah. So it took about a
- **[27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1667s)** — week, but on Wednesday night or Thursday morning, I started to get emails from some of my buying
- **[27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1673s)** — club members where they were forwarding something from the health department. And the health
- **[27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1678s)** — department never said they did something wrong. They never apologized. But the email basically
- **[28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1684s)** — said that there had been a misunderstanding, you know, because sending people to a private
- **[28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1691s)** — buying club where people are merely picking up food from local farmers and threatening them
- **[28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1696s)** — all with fines and jail is just a misunderstanding. But they completely walked away. And the best
- **[28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3vjumXPLU&t=1704s)** — news for us has been ever since that, that's 13 years ago now, unless a farmer in Kentucky
