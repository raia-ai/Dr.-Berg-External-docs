- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=0s)** — Today I want to show you a very unique way to get rid of that really stubborn belly fat.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=6s)** — If you're female or male, we're going to talk about the differences. I'm going to talk about
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=10s)** — if it's better to use exercise or diet or other techniques. But for most of you watching, this is
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=15s)** — probably new information that you've never heard before. So definitely take notes. One of the
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=20s)** — things that I think is very important before you jump into solving any problem is to really
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=26s)** — understand the problem a little bit more. So when we're dealing with belly fat, we're dealing
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=29s)** — with... there's different names for it. Central obesity, visceral fat, abdominal obesity. There's
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=37s)** — a lot of different names for this belly fat. And so this type of fat is very different than your
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=44s)** — superficial fat. It's called subcutaneous. That's just underneath the skin. Belly fat or visceral
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=49s)** — fat is fat that is ectopic, which means it's outside the fat cell. The fat is in the organs
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=57s)** — and it's especially in your liver. So in other words, if you have belly fat, you have liver fat.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=64s)** — And it is essential to get rid of the fat off the liver to get rid of this midsection weight.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=69s)** — Now there's quite a few mistakes people make when they're trying to deal with this. They're
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=72s)** — at the gym trying to do spot exercises where they're doing sit-ups and crunches for weeks,
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=78s)** — months, and they're not seeing any change. They go on a diet and many times that won't
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=83s)** — work either unless it targets the liver. So I'll just give you a little picture of what's happening
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=89s)** — here. So we have liver that is filling up with fat. It's spilling off into the midsection
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=95s)** — around the organs in your visceral. That's all the organs in the mid part of your belly.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=101s)** — And this is called ectopic fat. And what's really going on behind the scenes is there's
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=108s)** — this hormone called insulin. And insulin is a fat storing hormone. It also prevents you from
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=113s)** — losing your fat. So there's a lot of insulin being pumped out by the pancreas and then that's
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=120s)** — turning into insulin resistance, which makes it really hard to lose weight because the body is
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=127s)** — pumping out so much insulin and that insulin communication is store fat, store fat, store fat.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=133s)** — And then this ectopic fat basically creates insulin resistance. So it's a never-ending
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=140s)** — cycle. And of course, you may already know that carbohydrates and sugars and things like that
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=146s)** — increase insulin. But also there's something called gluconeogenesis. That's where your liver
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=151s)** — is making new sugar. And if you have insulin resistance, your liver will make sugar,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=156s)** — not even from the sugar that you eat in the diet. It can actually be converting other things
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=160s)** — to sugar. And it's kind of a double-edged sword because you have your own liver making sugar,
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=166s)** — which is then converting into more fat and making more fat. So I need to kind of explain how to
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=172s)** — correct this. There are six things we're going to talk about. And one of the solutions is not
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=177s)** — to detoxify the liver. That is not going to work. And yes, exercise can help, but not as a
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=183s)** — direct way to burn off the fat. It's more to use up the energy, also to help your stress,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=188s)** — and also to help you sleep better. Because not only is it the carbs that raise insulin,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=196s)** — but also the stress activates a hormone called cortisol. And cortisol is a sugar hormone,
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=202s)** — and it will release sugar. In fact, it's called glucocorticoid. If you take a look at
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=207s)** — some of the synthetic versions of cortisol that they use as medications, like prednisone for
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=212s)** — all sorts of inflammatory conditions, if you look at the side effect, it's major weight gain,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=218s)** — especially in your midsection. If you look up excessive production of cortisol, you will see
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=223s)** — a picture of someone's belly. Why? Because cortisol mobilizes different tissues and turns
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=230s)** — your muscles into fat. So let me just talk about this right now. Reducing stress, but
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=239s)** — with more sleep through the type of exercise that I did a whole video on this,
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=245s)** — aerobic exercise. You can see that? No, you can't see that. So I'm going to write down right
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=255s)** — here aerobic. What is this? That's walks, long walks. Best way to reduce stress or physical work
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=266s)** — around the house. Very, very important for reducing stress because it takes the mind off
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=270s)** — things. But you want low intensity, long duration walks. It's going to help not necessarily
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=277s)** — burn off the fat, but it's going to help burn off the adrenaline and the cortisol that's flowing
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=283s)** — through the body from the stress. Reducing stress is going to help you sleep and it will
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=287s)** — burn off some calories as well. But let me just kind of talk about burning calories off.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=293s)** — And what I mean by that? Well, the energy factory of the body is called the mitochondria
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=300s)** — right here. Okay. And the purpose of the mitochondria is to take your calories and then
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=308s)** — turn it into chemical fuel called ATP. ATP is like the battery of the body. And so the
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=315s)** — mitochondria is the battery maker. Okay. And what it's doing is it's extracting energy
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=321s)** — from food and it's turning it into this right here. So then it can be used. What's
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=329s)** — stored? Okay. So you don't really have a lot of stored ATP at any one time, very small amount.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=337s)** — So here's the thing you need to know. What can we do to increase more ATP production and
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=342s)** — burning? That's the question. Well, that relates to exercise. So exercise does have
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=348s)** — an important factor. Especially if you understand that when you compare someone at rest versus
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=354s)** — when they're exercising, you can increase the production of ATP by a thousand times by intense
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=362s)** — exercise. So I do recommend doing periodic intense exercise. It's called high intensity
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=371s)** — interval training with the walking for various reasons. One is to start using up some of this
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=377s)** — energy right here. We want to use up the fat right here. Right. And we want to add the right
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=383s)** — exercise. And we want to do high intensity, full body type exercise. You can do sprinting
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=389s)** — up a hill. You can do a spin bike. You can do weights, any type of exercise that will
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=396s)** — increase a great amount of demand for energy. And then that's going to tap into your reserve,
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=402s)** — which is the midsection fat over here. A couple of things you need to know about exercise.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=407s)** — You want to make sure you don't over train because if you over train, it's going to
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=410s)** — stress. So it's very, very important exercise, like high intensity, maybe
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=417s)** — three times a week, maybe two times a week. Recently I am running up hills for exercise,
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=423s)** — like really major intense hill running. I think I'll end up doing it maybe twice a week,
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=430s)** — not three times a week because my body doesn't recover. And I do have a machine or a test
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=435s)** — to determine that. That's going to be another video. But the point is that it's very easy
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=439s)** — to over train. I will get much better results if I let my body rest in between this high
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=445s)** — intensity exercise. And plus the high intensity exercise will stimulate growth hormone, which
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=450s)** — is the main fat burning hormone, but only if you are sleeping. Okay. So I should put down
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=457s)** — right here. Well, you can't see that sleep. Okay. Sleep to get more. Well,
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=466s)** — you can't even see that, right? Let's put it right here. Okay. Sleep. So that's really
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=472s)** — important to help with the stress. Stress and sleep are in the same category. It's going to
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=477s)** — really help you because it's kind of like a foundational thing. If you're not sleeping
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=482s)** — because you're stressed out, good luck with losing weight. Why? Because the cortisol prevents
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=488s)** — you from tapping into this fat. And especially if you're trying to get rid of the midsection.
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=493s)** — Very important. And this is why I'm spending a bit more time on it. All right. Number two,
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=499s)** — what's happening in your liver is the liver is fatty. And so it's spilling off. So we must
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=508s)** — use up the fat on your liver. Okay. Now there's two things that you can do to get
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=514s)** — yourself into what's called ketosis, which is a type of fat burning, right? Because when your
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=520s)** — burns fat or when you eat fat, that's mobilized into a more easily packaged type of energy
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=529s)** — called ketones. That's why your body makes ketones. It can also run on fat fuel as well,
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=535s)** — but ketones are like a better packaged fat fuel. So there's two sources of ketones. One
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=542s)** — is your own fat. And number two is the dietary fat. And here's the thing to be able
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=548s)** — to tap into either one of these fats. You must reduce your carbs, right? So the reduction of
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=554s)** — carbs is important. And you probably already know that we must reduce the carbs, but reducing
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=562s)** — the carbs will force your body to either burn fat from the calories that you eat or your own
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=568s)** — fat. Now let's talk about, do we want to burn calories from the fat that you eat,
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=575s)** — or do we want to burn your own stored fat? Well, that's a easy question. We want to burn
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=582s)** — our own stored fat. So yes, it is true that the amount of calories of fat on the ketogenic
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=590s)** — diet are much higher than other diets. But if you are trying to lose weight in your midsection,
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=599s)** — adding a lot more dietary fat is not going to help you. So I'm going to recommend,
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=605s)** — especially for this situation, is not to start adding additional fat. Don't go low fat,
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=611s)** — but don't add a lot of fat. Don't add the MCT oil. Don't add the keto bombs and desserts.
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=617s)** — Just don't do that because your body is going to tap into that as fuel and not your own fat.
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=624s)** — Now I do recommend for some people to eat more fat to help them be more satisfied so they
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=630s)** — can actually go longer within a minute fasting in the beginning of a program.
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=634s)** — But if we're trying to quickly and rapidly get rid of this midsection fat, you don't want to
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=641s)** — add a lot of fat to your diet unless you want to maintain your weight. So we want to right
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=647s)** — here reduce dietary fat, but not to the point of going low fat. So don't go below 75 grams
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=657s)** — of fat per day. I would just consume your fat from the normal proteins in nature that just come
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=665s)** — with the fat, whether it's meat, eggs, and things like that. Don't go low fat. Don't eat
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=669s)** — the egg whites alone. But what we're trying to do is we're trying to force your body to tap
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=673s)** — into mainly your own fat. So that's number three. Number four. The real problem that
- **[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=683s)** — is in the liver. Because the liver is the organ that is overfilled with fat and it's spilling
- **[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=691s)** — off into the abdominal area. So in other words, you're going to have to do things to
- **[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=697s)** — get this fat off the liver and heal it and make it really healthy. If it was healthy,
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=703s)** — chances are it can deal with all this extra fat and not have so much insulin resistance.
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=709s)** — Because insulin resistance is a condition that is like a pre-diabetic condition,
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=714s)** — metabolic syndrome. You have a lot of issues with that and you're definitely going to have a lot
- **[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=717s)** — more insulin and a lot more fat in the midsection. So anything we can do for the
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=721s)** — liver is going to be very, very important. So what can we do for the liver? Well,
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=727s)** — we already lower the carbs and some people can actually lose 50% of their fat off their
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=733s)** — within two weeks getting on the low carb diet. But there are three important things
- **[12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=741s)** — that you can take to supplement and help heal the liver. The one is apple cider vinegar.
- **[12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=749s)** — That greatly improves insulin. It greatly helps a fatty liver. It greatly makes insulin more
- **[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=756s)** — sensitive to allow the insulin to work better in the body. So what you do is you take a
- **[12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=763s)** — put it in 12 ounces of water. I like to put lemon in there too and maybe some electrolytes
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=767s)** — and I'll drink that once, twice, or even three times a day. Very significant changes can occur
- **[12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=775s)** — if you do that. The type of apple cider vinegar I use is from Fairchild's, not Bragg's,
- **[13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=780s)** — because they don't dilute it. It's nice and strong and it's a really good company.
- **[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=784s)** — The second very important supplement is called milk thistle. Milk thistle is amazing. It's that
- **[13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=793s)** — prickly plant that has those purple flowers that then turn into these white little
- **[13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=799s)** — things at the end of a seed that look like parachutes. And so the wind blows, you can see
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=803s)** — them all around in the fields where I live anyway. And they're all over the place. Milk
- **[13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=809s)** — thistle is a very unique plant and you can get milk thistle seeds in tablet form. What's
- **[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=822s)** — high in liver protecting properties? Basically, it's like the antidote to a snake poisoning or a
- **[13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=830s)** — mushroom poison. The most deadly mushroom is called the death cap mushroom. The antidote is
- **[13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=836s)** — milk thistle. It's quite amazing. Tylenol poisoning, people that drink alcohol, this
- **[14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=843s)** — can help protect the liver. But it's also really important for a fatty liver, in correcting
- **[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=849s)** — as well as reducing inflammation on a liver and also protecting the liver from getting cirrhosis
- **[14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=857s)** — and helping with this gluconeogenesis issue where your liver is producing a lot more sugar
- **[14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=864s)** — because it has insulin resistance. So it helps with a lot of different aspects of that liver,
- **[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=869s)** — as well as helping with midsection weight. And I put some research down below. You can check
- **[14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=873s)** — it out. Milk thistle is a given. The third thing is Berberine. There's several studies that show
- **[14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=882s)** — combining Berberine with milk thistle is a good idea. Berberine is kind of... I look at it like a
- **[14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=889s)** — natural metformin without the side effects. But of course, I'm not making that claim.
- **[14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=895s)** — And also I don't want to make any claims on milk thistle. All I can say is you can
- **[14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=899s)** — read the research and it's pretty amazing with the research that's done on mice. So you can apply
- **[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=906s)** — it to humans if you want. But the point is that if it works on mice, maybe it can work on you.
- **[15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=912s)** — But Berberine is a really good one with the milk thistle. It's good for diabetics and
- **[15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=918s)** — pre-diabetics. And it helps the liver with this extra gluconeogenesis. One thing I want
- **[15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=926s)** — to mention about people trying to lose weight... I watch people through the year go through this
- **[15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=930s)** — cycle. And it's like this pattern. They just go crazy between Thanksgiving and Christmas and
- **[15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=937s)** — New Year's and then they start all over again and they go through this New Year's resolution.
- **[15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=942s)** — I think emotions and intelligence are inverted. People get wrapped up in emotions
- **[15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=951s)** — at social activities, birthday parties, events, holidays, going out to dinner with friends. And I
- **[15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=958s)** — watch this. And the intelligence or the IQ with foods goes out the window. People don't really
- **[16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=964s)** — learn from their mistakes. They keep going in these same patterns over and over and over
- **[16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=969s)** — again because they're eating things that they know are bad for the liver and they're drinking
- **[16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=973s)** — alcohol that they know is bad for the liver. But they still do it because they're wrapped
- **[16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=977s)** — up in the emotions. So I'm going to recommend that you step back for a second and really
- **[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=983s)** — re-evaluate your environment and the people around you. And just don't get in those situations.
- **[16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=991s)** — Change the habits. In a person with belly fat, you have to realize that's not just
- **[16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=997s)** — a minor thing. It's pathological. It's disease-creating. It's creating inflammation.
- **[16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1002s)** — It's creating problems in your liver. You might not see it inside, but it's not a healthy
- **[16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1007s)** — state. And so usually a person with belly fat doesn't have the luxury of continuing these bad
- **[16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1014s)** — habits over again because they're just doing the wrong things. They must focus on changing
- **[16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1019s)** — their habits. That's the most important thing they need to focus on because they're in this
- **[17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1024s)** — habit and they're going through the cycle. But the point is for me, I had to hit bottom
- **[17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1031s)** — before I made changes. I was the worst. I ate the worst food all the way up until my late 20s.
- **[17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1039s)** — I mean, I just wouldn't eat a little junk food. I would eat a tremendous amount of junk food,
- **[17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1044s)** — pots of coffee, pots of chocolate. I would never eat anything like vegetables or celery,
- **[17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1049s)** — any of that stuff. I only ate pure junk food for so many years. I had to hit bottom.
- **[17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1055s)** — Even when I hit bottom, it took me many years to feel terrible before I said,
- **[17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1062s)** — it's not worth it anymore. So now my liver is like a barometer. If I go off the program,
- **[17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1068s)** — my body does not react well. If I were to drink alcohol, I just would want to go to
- **[17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1073s)** — sleep. I think that's a good thing because I never in a million years would have gotten
- **[17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1077s)** — into health if I didn't have these health problems. So I have a lot of personal
- **[18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1082s)** — experience doing this. And I do know I used to get wrapped up in the emotion of it and I've
- **[18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1087s)** — corrected that. But for some people, it takes them a bit longer before they learn from their
- **[18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1093s)** — mistakes. And then number five is omet. One meal a day in a minute fasting. If this doesn't
- **[18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1102s)** — happen right here, if a person still eats frequently and snacks, I don't think these
- **[18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1108s)** — other things are going to work. This is probably one of the most important things
- **[18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1111s)** — right here. Actually, the most important thing because when you don't eat, you force your body
- **[18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1119s)** — to live off its fat reserves. So it's like a pure fat burning experience. You can get into
- **[18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1126s)** — deep ketosis if you combine low carb, OMAD with exercise. And when I say OMAD, you don't
- **[18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1133s)** — have to start off with one meal a day. You can start off with two meals a day,
- **[18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1136s)** — but try to keep the time close. Like maybe have a late lunch, early dinner. And if you
- **[19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1142s)** — really want to take it to the next level, just don't eat if you're not hungry.
- **[19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1146s)** — Which means you might go one meal every other day and you're going to tap into
- **[19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1154s)** — like a vacuum, all this fat off your liver and pull it off. You'll see some very quick
- **[19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1159s)** — changes. Very, very important. And that is the way to really speed everything up. So this is
- **[19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1163s)** — a foundational thing. And what's cool about it is when you don't eat, your body is eating,
- **[19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1171s)** — so you're not starving it. You're actually creating a tremendous amount of health by not
- **[19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1176s)** — eating from many different angles, especially just stripping off all this fat off of your
- **[19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1182s)** — liver. And just to go back to this low carb thing, the ketogenic diet, I didn't talk
- **[19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1189s)** — what to eat. You can find that in my video. I'll put it down below. But also,
- **[19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1194s)** — OMAD, when you eat certain foods, what type of foods would be good for correcting this
- **[20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1200s)** — situation? And there's a couple interesting nutrients that I want to share with you.
- **[20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1204s)** — One is creatine and the other is carnasine. And both of those can help you with a fatty
- **[20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1211s)** — liver. Both of those can help you with increasing more energy to exercise. Both of those can help
- **[20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1219s)** — you mobilize the fat through the mitochondria down here and produce more ATP efficiently.
- **[20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1228s)** — And those two compounds, creatine and carnasine, are the highest in red meat. So I would
- **[20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1237s)** — highly recommend doing red meat several times a week or hamburger or things like that from a
- **[20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1243s)** — quality source, grass-fed, grass-finished red meat or a steak because you have a lot of
- **[20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1249s)** — factors in there. You have a lot of nutrients, there's virtually no carbs, and you have that
- **[20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1254s)** — carnasine and creatine that can help you. And I'll put the studies down below. I don't
- **[21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1260s)** — even think you need to take them as a supplement. Just get it from red meat.
- **[21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1263s)** — All right, number six, it's staying very aware.
- **[21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1273s)** — Okay, and not slipping into this emotional thing that people go through these different holidays.
- **[21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1281s)** — Staying very aware of what works, what doesn't work, of your past mistakes, and just
- **[21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1290s)** — don't keep making them. So keep your awareness up and kind of like just
- **[21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1295s)** — be in the present, right? And so you don't kind of slide into this thing. I think this is very
- **[21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1299s)** — important too because this will help you be consistent, right? Because you're going to
- **[21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1304s)** — do all these things, it's going to work, and then you want to just keep building on your
- **[21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1309s)** — successes. So what I like to do is just each day get better and better and better. Okay,
- **[21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1315s)** — screw up, good. Then correct it, do better, and keep implementing the things that worked,
- **[21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1319s)** — and then get rid of the things that don't work. Okay, so I think this is going to be
- **[22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1323s)** — important too because how many people just either forget what they did or just ignore it. They
- **[22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1329s)** — just slide into this whole thing, which the logic goes out the window, and so does their
- **[22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1335s)** — health. So anyway, I think these actions can really take you to the next level if you want to
- **[22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1340s)** — get rid of your belly fat or whatever you want to call it. Central obesity, visceral fat,
- **[22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHgDOwdZtfQ&t=1344s)** — or whatever. Now if you want special content that is not on YouTube, you should go to my site,
