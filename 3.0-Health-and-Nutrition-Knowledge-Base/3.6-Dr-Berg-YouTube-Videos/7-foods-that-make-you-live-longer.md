- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the seven foods that have the potential to increase longevity.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=6s)** — Now, the majority of illnesses and chronic disease
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=9s)** — relates to the mitochondria at the cellular level.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=14s)** — Anything that can help support or maintain or improve the mitochondria
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=20s)** — can potentially help you live longer.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=22s)** — Anything that destroys the mitochondria, you're not going to live as long.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=25s)** — And at the very top of the list, there's one molecule that's very, very powerful.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=30s)** — It's called PQQ.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=32s)** — What it does is it increases the number of mitochondria.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=36s)** — And it is also involved in the continuous recharging and discharging
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=41s)** — of electrons in the battery in your mitochondria.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=45s)** — Then you get into what's called physics, which involves electrons.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=49s)** — So we're dealing with the creation of a battery.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=52s)** — So the mitochondria has a very important function of creating ATP,
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=56s)** — which are mini little batteries.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=58s)** — And this molecule, PQQ, can actually do both.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=62s)** — It can help discharge and release energy and help recharge energy as well.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=68s)** — It increases the number of mitochondria.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=70s)** — It's very important in your brain, in your cognitive function.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=73s)** — And if you're missing this molecule in your food, you have a lot of problems.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=77s)** — And it's ten times stronger than resveratrol.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=80s)** — And out of all the foods that have the most PQQ, it's the cacao.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=86s)** — That is kind of the precursor to cocoa or chocolate.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=89s)** — Then you have cocoa, which is heated, and chocolate is more processed.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=93s)** — But even chocolate as a finished product, even though it's heated,
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=97s)** — has a large amount of this PQQ.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=99s)** — Now, the negative part of chocolate usually comes in sugar.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=104s)** — But if you were to get the, let's say, the 85% or maybe even 90%,
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=110s)** — you'd get just a very tiny bit of sugar.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=112s)** — And the other negative part is that cacao is very high in oxalates.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=117s)** — So if you're prone to kidney stones, probably not a good idea.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=120s)** — But even in general, if you just have a small piece,
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=123s)** — you're getting a smaller amount of these oxalates,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=126s)** — and it's probably not going to be a big problem.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=128s)** — But just to make sure as an extra precaution,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=131s)** — if you were to have this, you know, little bit of chocolate
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=135s)** — right after your lunch, and you had some cheese,
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=138s)** — that extra calcium will help reduce the oxalates being absorbed.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=143s)** — But cacao or chocolate also has polyphenols.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=147s)** — It's very, very high in magnesium.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=149s)** — But polyphenols are also in berries, grass-fed meat,
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=154s)** — they're in grass-fed cheese.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=156s)** — In fact, I submitted some of our cattle meat into a research project,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=161s)** — and I got the results back, and there was like super high amounts
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=164s)** — of polyphenols in the meat, the animal meat.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=167s)** — So when the animals eat the plants that have the polyphenols,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=171s)** — you're going to get that indirectly.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=173s)** — So polyphenols are another thing that increases the number of mitochondria.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=178s)** — Polyphenols also increase SOD,
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=181s)** — which is something that helps to reduce oxidation, free radical damage.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=187s)** — It also is an enzyme that reduces hydrogen peroxide in the cells.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=190s)** — It has the potential to decrease inflammation.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=193s)** — If your gut microbiome is not very good,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=196s)** — if you have a lot of digestive issues, you might not benefit from polyphenols.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=200s)** — But if you have a good gut microbiome,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=204s)** — your microbes will help you absorb these polyphenols.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=207s)** — And if the polyphenols are in the animal meat or the goat's cheese,
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=213s)** — that's probably a lot more bioavailable than consuming them straight from plants.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=218s)** — Alright, coenzyme Q10 is also used in our mitochondria,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=222s)** — especially the part where you're dealing with electrons.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=224s)** — That's the last part of that whole cycle.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=227s)** — So this coenzyme Q10 allows for these electrons to travel through
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=231s)** — and allows you to make ATP.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=233s)** — Statins block an enzyme that also is involved in this coenzyme Q10.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=239s)** — And so if you're on a statin, you better be taking coenzyme Q10,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=242s)** — or else you're going to have a lot of muscle side effects.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=246s)** — It increases the antioxidant capacity in your body.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=249s)** — It's even a therapy for mitochondrial diseases.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=252s)** — But it's also in liver, it's in red meat, it's also in fatty fish.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=256s)** — Alright, next one is L-carnitine.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=258s)** — It basically helps you burn the fat, okay?
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=261s)** — When you exercise, L-carnitine helps preserve muscle protein.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=266s)** — L-carnitine helps you recover from exercise as well.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=269s)** — Take a wild guess where you're going to get most of the L-carnitine.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=272s)** — It's very high in red meat, the exact food that they tell you not to eat.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=277s)** — So the next molecule is carnosine.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=279s)** — This molecule greatly restores mitochondrial damage.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=284s)** — It helps buffer the pH, it helps decrease inflammation,
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=287s)** — it gets rid of oxidative stress,
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=290s)** — it even decreases something called glycation, which occurs in diabetics,
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=295s)** — and it occurs when you're eating sugar.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=297s)** — A lot of people who consume either sugar and protein or sugar and fat
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=300s)** — end up having this glycation which kind of binds up the protein.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=303s)** — Well guess what?
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=305s)** — Carnosine will help get rid of that.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=307s)** — And also carnosine delays aging.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=310s)** — And take a wild guess what food you're going to find carnosine in?
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=313s)** — Red meat.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=315s)** — Okay, the next molecule I want to talk about is called phycocyanin.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=320s)** — Phycocyanin. This is in spirulina.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=323s)** — This is not an animal product. It's an algae.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=327s)** — That molecule not only improves oxidative stress,
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=330s)** — but also it can increase mitochondrial biogenesis.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=333s)** — It can increase the number of mitochondria.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=336s)** — It helps protect the DNA. It helps repair DNA.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=341s)** — Number seven, EPA and DHA.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=345s)** — These fatty acids both directly improve mitochondrial function.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=349s)** — They decrease oxidative stress.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=352s)** — They improve insulin sensitivity. They reduce inflammation.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=356s)** — And you can find these omega-3s in salmon, sardines.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=360s)** — You're going to find probably the most in cod liver and cod liver oil.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=367s)** — Now, since we talked about the foods that extend your life,
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=369s)** — let's talk about the most dangerous food that could shorten your lifespan.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEELE4sv2Ts&t=374s)** — And I put that up right here. Check it out.
