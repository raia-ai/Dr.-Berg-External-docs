- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the four ways to speed up the growth of muscle. Now you have about 650 muscles
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=6s)** — in your body and I'm talking mainly the skeletal muscles, not into the other muscles. But the
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=11s)** — purpose of muscle is to create movement, to help you with posture, to help you even with your
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=17s)** — metabolism. If you don't have enough muscle mass, let's say you're getting older and you lose
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=22s)** — your muscle, you lose your metabolism too. So you have a lot of mitochondria that helps you
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=27s)** — burn fat in your muscle. And then also muscle helps pump the lymphatic system. And so if you
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=33s)** — don't move a lot, you're not going to pump your limp through your body. Now there are two
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=37s)** — not surprising ways to increase muscle growth. You already know this. High intensity exercise
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=43s)** — and the consumption of protein. You're not going to grow muscles on a vegan burger, okay,
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=48s)** — or a plant-based burger. It's not going to happen. You need the best source of protein and
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=53s)** — that would be animal protein. Steak and eggs are at the top of the list. Now how much protein
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=58s)** — you need? Anywhere between 0.8 to 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of weight. Now what I mean
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=69s)** — by kilogram of weight, I'm talking about of your kilogram of lean body muscle weight. So if
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=75s)** — you're a really big person and you have a lot of fat, you got to do this calculation on
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=80s)** — lean body mass. And I will put a link down below to kind of help you figure out that calculation.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=86s)** — Now if you're not into kilograms, you're into more in pounds. There's a different formula
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=90s)** — for that. I'm going to put that down below. When you're talking about grams of protein,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=95s)** — we're not talking about the actual weight of a steak, for example, we're talking about the
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=100s)** — protein in that steak. Let's say for example, if we talk about pounds, right? And you weigh
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=109s)** — about 185 pounds and that's how much lean body mass you have. That would come out to about 84
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=115s)** — kilograms. Okay, if we do the calculation on 0.8 grams, I would just times that times 84 and
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=123s)** — that comes out to 67 grams. And then if we look at the high range 1.5 grams and we do
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=129s)** — that calculation, we're talking between 67 grams of protein to 126 grams of protein.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=136s)** — So what would determine if you're on the low end or the high end? Your age, how active you
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=141s)** — are, how much exercise you do, and the strength of your digestive system. Like if
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=146s)** — you're 95 years old, you're probably not going to do the top highest amount of protein
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=151s)** — versus if you were an athlete at 20 years old. And some people might even need to go up to 2
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=156s)** — grams of protein per kilogram of lean body mass. Now let's get into the surprising things
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=162s)** — that can increase the speed of muscle growth. First thing on the list is creatine, right? And
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=168s)** — by the way, creatine is in foods, especially meat. But if we want to speed up the growth of
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=175s)** — muscle, we want to take it as a supplement. It's not necessarily creating muscle itself,
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=181s)** — but indirectly it is. Because creatine is kind of like a buffer or a substitute for energy,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=188s)** — especially the initial high intensity exercise with short duration. Even before glucose is made,
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=197s)** — you use a type of creatine. And that's used as energy to allow you to recycle or recover
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=203s)** — this ATP. And what's unique about that is when you exercise high intensity, short duration,
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=210s)** — that is what increases the muscle growth. And so creatine allows you to do that. If you don't
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=216s)** — have enough creatine, you're not going to have the energy to work out like that, number one.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=220s)** — And the energy that's supplying the system actually can help you grow this muscle. It allows
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=224s)** — you to do more work. I mean, if you're going to go work out and build muscles,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=229s)** — and you're tired and you don't have enough energy, it's probably not going to happen.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=233s)** — Now, as far as how much creatine you need, if you're really serious about building muscles,
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=237s)** — I would use 20 grams for about five days, and then go down to like a maintenance dosage
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=245s)** — of three grams for the rest of the month. And then you would cycle to a higher amount,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=251s)** — 20 grams for five days, and then cycle back to your smaller maintenance amount. Number two,
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=258s)** — cold therapy. Now you can do cold showers, cold immersion, cryotherapy. There's a lot of
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=264s)** — versions of this. When you're in the cold, the body has to do something very, very unique.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=270s)** — It has to maintain the core temperature. So it has to generate a tremendous amount of energy
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=276s)** — to do that. So to do that, you're going to generate this type of brown fat, which then
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=281s)** — will stimulate the white fat, and you're going to burn a lot of calories. And so the
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=286s)** — of burning more calories, burning more fat, and the cold therapy, both in rats and humans,
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=295s)** — increases the expression of the muscle genes, certain genes in your muscles that help the
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=303s)** — growth of muscle, as well as something called the RNA, which is kind of like the protein
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=309s)** — factory that makes different proteins. Cold therapy increases that. Cold therapy also
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=316s)** — decreases inflammation. Now you may have heard studies that show that cold therapy
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=322s)** — actually does not increase your muscle. It actually will shrink your muscles.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=329s)** — That is true initially, but in the recovery phase, it will increase the muscle size. It's
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=339s)** — stressed in the body to create some cool changes. All right, number three,
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=344s)** — intermittent fasting. There's one school of thought that if you're not eating,
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=348s)** — your muscles are going to waste away. But what happens when you do intermittent fasting,
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=352s)** — you stimulate growth hormone, you stimulate all sorts of things that indirectly can
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=358s)** — potentially increase muscle through the hormone growth hormone. Here's the catch 22.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=364s)** — You're probably not going to grow any muscles if you're doing any type of prolonged fasting.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=369s)** — I'm talking about just doing intermittent fasting like two meals a day, not cutting your calories
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=375s)** — down, just not having the snacks. Because intermittent fasting will also make insulin
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=380s)** — more sensitive. So by fixing insulin resistance, you can actually get more insulin to the
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=385s)** — muscle because the snacking just kills this whole process. Here's another catch 22.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=392s)** — You got to be somewhat healthy to do fasting. I mean, if you take a really sick person and
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=399s)** — you start to put them on this stress of fasting, it might not be the best thing
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=405s)** — to start them out on. I'm talking about a person who is not sickly, who has somewhat
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=411s)** — of a good health and that can do this correctly and also combine at the same time
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=417s)** — the exercise because they have the energy to do it. Number four, arginine. And it can significantly
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=423s)** — help you increase growth hormone by inhibiting another hormone called somatostatin. So arginine
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=430s)** — kind of takes the breaks off of growth hormone. They've even given children that are
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=434s)** — a bit shorter than they should be about 2.2 grams of arginine. And notice that they actually
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=440s)** — grew taller. But arginine is another surprising way to enhance the growth of muscle. But what
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=446s)** — you want to do is you want to take a bit higher amounts, between three to six grams per day on an
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=451s)** — empty stomach. And I think the best time to take it is about 30 minutes before you work out.
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDHHIgcwlU&t=457s)** — Now, if you have not seen my other powerful video to grow muscles, I put it right here.
