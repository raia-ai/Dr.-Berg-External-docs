- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=0s)** — Unfortunately, in the medical profession, they don't do this. They don't look deeper.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=4s)** — Basically, I'm taking one symptom and I'm going to show you how I find out what's underneath
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=8s)** — the symptom. Because you never want to just treat the symptom without finding the root cause.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=12s)** — For example, the ridges on the nail are the tip of the iceberg. They don't ask,
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=16s)** — why do I have ridges on my nails? There are several connections between ridge nails
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=22s)** — and a nutrient deficiency. You have to kind of know the potential causes. But the question is,
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=27s)** — do we know which one of those potential causes is the cause? There's really only three deficiencies
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=33s)** — that are going to create the vertical ridges. Number one, an iron deficiency. Number two,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=39s)** — a zinc deficiency. And number three, a biotin deficiency. Biotin is a B vitamin. Basically,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=45s)** — what I do to figure this out is I will start with iron and I'm going to ask them
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=50s)** — questions to find out if they are iron deficient and if that's the problem. If
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=55s)** — they're female, are you menstruating too much? Do you have symptoms of anemia? Like, are you
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=60s)** — tired a lot? Did they get weak easily? Of course, I'll get into the diet too. Are they
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=65s)** — a vegan? Because vegans never eat red meat and red meat is loaded with iron. And when you
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=71s)** — consume plants like spinach, there's iron in there, but it's not very bioavailable. I also
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=76s)** — know that someone could actually have a genetic problem with iron where they have too much
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=81s)** — iron. This is interesting because if they have too much iron, they're also going to be anemic
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=85s)** — because it's dysfunctional. Ask them questions about their liver. Do they have a history of
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=90s)** — cirrhosis of the liver? Do they feel better when they donate blood? Have you ever had a genetic
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=95s)** — test where they said something about iron looking for an iron deficiency or an iron excess?
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=100s)** — I might ask a question like, do you crave ice? And even people that crave dirt are
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=106s)** — deficient in iron. And then I also might ask them, are they cold? Do they have cold feet,
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=110s)** — cold hands? And that just would kind of give me a clue if it's more of an iron deficiency
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=114s)** — based on those questions. But of course, I'm not just only going to ask them those questions.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=118s)** — I'm going to shift also to some other questions to rule out. Is it a zinc deficiency? Do they
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=123s)** — ever have a problem with getting sick frequently and taking a long time to overcome
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=128s)** — an infection? I'm going to ask them about testosterone because zinc definitely helps increase
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=134s)** — testosterone. And let's say they have a libido issue or rectal dysfunction or a loss
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=139s)** — of muscle mass that could help me kind of associate those symptoms with the cause. I will
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=143s)** — also ask them when they're driving at night, do they have a difficult time seeing in the dark?
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=148s)** — Night blindness is usually a vitamin A deficiency, but zinc is also necessary for vitamin A to
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=155s)** — work. And this is all related to a certain pigment in the eye that allows you to see
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=160s)** — in dim light. As far as hair goes, alopecia would be one symptom of a zinc deficiency. I'm
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=169s)** — rashes inflammation of the skin is definitely related to zinc. I might also ask them, did they
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=174s)** — drink a lot of alcohol or do they eat junk foods, which will really deplete you of zinc.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=179s)** — Then I also might ask them about the foods related to zinc, because you're going to get
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=183s)** — a lot of zinc if you have red meat, but also shellfish, seafood, things like that. After I
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=188s)** — have those questions, I'll shift to the biotin deficiency questions. What's unique about
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=193s)** — biotin is that a good percentage of your biotin is made by your own microbes. I will ask
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=198s)** — do you have a history of a lot of antibiotics because that's going to destroy the microbes that
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=203s)** — make biotin. Then I'll ask them about their hair. Does their hair break easily? Is their
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=209s)** — nail thin? That's going to give me a huge clue on if it's a biotin deficiency. Sometimes when
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=214s)** — people just bang their nail on something and it just breaks, it could be a biotin deficiency
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=219s)** — as well. If someone's very severely deficient in biotin, they're going to have neurological
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=223s)** — problems. It's called peripheral neuropathy in their feet. So that would be something I would
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=227s)** — look for. But what you need to know is biotin, zinc, and iron all control collagen. And if
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=233s)** — you're deficient in those, you're not going to make the collagen necessary for the nail to be
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=239s)** — formed correctly. After assessing all these questions, it's going to be very easy for me
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=242s)** — to isolate the real underlying cause, the most likely cause, which then I will either recommend
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=249s)** — eating more of that food or I will recommend consuming it as a supplement. As far as iron
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=254s)** — I never like recommending an iron supplement because it's very harsh and I don't like the
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=260s)** — types of iron that they give people. I might recommend grass-fed liver pills or spleen extract
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=266s)** — pills. They work great. Or just consume more red meat. That's for iron. And of course with zinc,
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=272s)** — the best source of zinc is shellfish. Oysters are the top of the list, but you could also
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=279s)** — get a good amount of zinc in grass-fed beef. As far as a zinc supplement, I would recommend
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=283s)** — taking probably 50 milligrams of zinc in a blend of other trace minerals that include copper.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=290s)** — Because anytime you take zinc in higher amounts over a long period of time, it can deplete you
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=294s)** — of copper. I like my zinc to be in a blend of trace minerals with copper. You always want to
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=299s)** — have 10 times as much zinc as copper. So it would be like a one to 10 ratio. And this is
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=304s)** — a very rough estimate. So if you're doing 10 milligrams of zinc, you have one milligram
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=308s)** — of copper. Then we get to biotin. If we need more biotin, I would recommend taking a
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=312s)** — zinc supplement. But here's the problem. You don't necessarily want to buy the supplement
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=316s)** — that has the most biotin, because there's bottles of biotin that have like 30,000 times
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=324s)** — the RDA. So you don't need to go that extreme. But I do know a lot of people take biotin,
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=330s)** — boy, their nails get really super strong. As far as re-establishing biotin in your body,
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=335s)** — like consuming foods, it's not necessarily going to be adding certain foods that will
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=340s)** — increase biotin, because biotin is in so many different foods, as it is to build up your gut
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=345s)** — microbiome. And for that, you want to take a good probiotic or consume foods that are
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=349s)** — fermented. One other interesting thing about biotin is if you consume raw egg whites,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=356s)** — you can become biotin deficient, because there's something in this raw white of the egg
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=361s)** — that blocks your ability to absorb biotin. I just wanted to give you a simple example of
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=367s)** — best way to figure things out is not to treat this tip of the iceberg to find out what's
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=372s)** — deeper. Really understand that for every effect or symptom, there's a cause. All 5700 videos that
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=378s)** — I have are all about making these connections. And this is a huge gap within our healthcare
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=384s)** — system. They don't make these connections. They just treat the symptom as a problem.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=390s)** — And it covers up the real problem. Thank you for watching and I will see you in the next
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTOAIP9DfYo&t=394s)** — video.
