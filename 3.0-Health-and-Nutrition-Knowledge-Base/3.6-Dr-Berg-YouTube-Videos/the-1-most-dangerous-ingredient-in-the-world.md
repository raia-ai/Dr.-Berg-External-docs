- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=0s)** — You know, when I was in high school, I was lifting weights and I wanted to bulk up.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=3s)** — So I went to the health food store and I bought these Muscle Gainer protein powders, right?
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=8s)** — And I started consuming them. And man, did I feel like crap. And now I know why. Because
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=14s)** — there's one ingredient that is pretty dangerous. And they put this certain ingredient into these
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=19s)** — products to enhance muscle growth. But you're going to find out it's not going to do that.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=25s)** — Personally, I think it's a very dangerous ingredient. It can increase acne, bloating,
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=31s)** — inflammation in the gut, mental irritability and anxiety, insomnia. It's highly addictive
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=37s)** — because it increases dopamine, which is like the reward neurotransmitter. And it'll actually
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=42s)** — produce more acid in your mouth to promote cavities. But the worst thing it'll do,
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=47s)** — it'll spike your blood sugar so high, way more than sugar, and then create a crash right after.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=55s)** — Now, if you do this repetitively, you're going to develop belly fat, high cholesterol, and you know,
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=61s)** — a fatty liver. Other than that, I'm sure it's going to be fine. And this ingredient is usually
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=65s)** — the first ingredient in the list on the label, which means it represents most of the product.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=72s)** — And this ingredient is called maltodextrin. This is one of the worst ingredients in most
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=78s)** — ultra processed food products, aka junk food, where they start out with dent corn. What's dent
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=85s)** — corn? Dent corn is an edible. You can't eat it. Okay, it's for feed and things like that.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=90s)** — They grind it up into powder, and then they add acids and alkaline chemicals to it. And
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=96s)** — then they'll heat it up, they'll put pressure into it. And they have to take the color out,
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=101s)** — take the odor out. And then you end up with this powder. And what's wild about
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=106s)** — maltodextrin is that it's a filler. It's just some cheap material to add bulk to a product,
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=113s)** — so they can make more money. I mean, there's absolutely no benefit to taking this for your
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=117s)** — body. It's classified as a carbohydrate, but it acts like a sugar. So when you read the
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=124s)** — label, you're looking, oh, yeah, it's low in sugar. Take a look on the glycemic index,
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=128s)** — which is the index that shows you how much an ingredient spikes your blood sugar. Table sugar
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=134s)** — is about 65. Glucose is 100. Maltodextrin is between 105 and 185 on that scale. So it creates
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=145s)** — way more of a spike than even glucose. And check this out, in one serving, they're going
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=150s)** — to put 253 grams. Now in your mind, you're going, well, okay, it's 253 grams of carbs.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=157s)** — No, it's not. It's 253 grams of sugar, which is equivalent to 60 teaspoons of sugar. This is
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=165s)** — just in one serving. 1012 calories of sugar. Actually, it's something that's even worse than
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=171s)** — sugar. You're going to put in your body to supposedly bulk up your muscles. I mean,
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=177s)** — per serving, they're only going to give you 50 grams of protein as whey protein and 253
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=183s)** — grams of carbohydrate and sugar, right? It's not a good ratio. I mean, you don't want to combine
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=189s)** — protein with that much starch or sugar because it creates all sorts of issues in your body.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=195s)** — So when you dump that much carbohydrate into the energy factory called the mitochondria,
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=201s)** — your demand for certain vitamins are going to go super, super high. Like for B1, for
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=212s)** — much pure sugar. Of course, they add some vitamins in there, but they only add like
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=218s)** — 0.4 milligrams of B1. That's not going to even come in the ballpark of how much you need. So
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=224s)** — what happens is you end up depleting your nutrients when you take this much refined
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=229s)** — carbohydrate. I mean, just think about what this starch really is. It's ultra processed,
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=235s)** — which means they're extracting enzymes, vitamins, trace minerals. When you consume that,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=242s)** — it takes a lot of nutrient reserves that you have in your body to be able to even metabolize
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=248s)** — that. So you end up depleting things down the road when you can keep consuming it.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=254s)** — And in the process, you're creating a lot of what's called oxidation, which is kind of like
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=258s)** — you're rusting your body out from the inside out. And that's going to lead to inflammation.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=263s)** — And you not knowing that, not even realizing you're getting that much sugar, you might think,
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=267s)** — oh yeah, it's a great product. It's because everyone else is doing it. It's become normalized.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=273s)** — It doesn't even fit the definition of the word food. So it can't even be called ultra
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=277s)** — processed food, because it can't sustain life. You can't live on it. So you can imagine what's
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=282s)** — happened to the pancreas too, because every time you consume that it's like a massive spike
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=287s)** — of blood sugars. And that cell that makes this is pumping out of this insulin, it's just
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=291s)** — going to be like whiplashed every time you take it. And you're going to find that after you take
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=296s)** — it, you're going to feel kind of groggy. Blood sugars kind of feel funky. Next morning,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=299s)** — hard to get out of bed. And you wake up with low blood sugar, because you ate sugar the day
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=305s)** — before, which will cause you to want more of that to fulfill this emptiness. But then you
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=312s)** — keep doing this over weeks and months. And now what happens is the body's going to start
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=317s)** — developing something called insulin resistance. And now it's going to be harder and harder to get
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=322s)** — energy into the cells. And it's going to be harder to grow your muscles. To grow muscles,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=327s)** — you need exercise, you need protein. Nowhere have I ever observed that you need high doses
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=335s)** — of refined sugar to grow muscle. Yes, it increases insulin. And insulin is an anabolic
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=342s)** — hormone. But the problem is, when you start to stimulate insulin over a period of time,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=347s)** — you develop what's called insulin resistance. And that's what really creates a deficiency of
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=351s)** — insulin because you develop this resistance. It's just part of the body trying to protect
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=356s)** — itself from getting that much sugar. It'll start blocking it because sugar is toxic.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=361s)** — So if you haven't seen my full video on how to grow muscle that healthy way,
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ7MLOc9k9c&t=366s)** — I'm going to put this video up right here. Check it out.
