- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=0s)** — I'd like to talk about some not commonly known symptoms of a zinc deficiency. And because zinc
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=8s)** — is so important in your body, it's a trace mineral, you don't need a lot of it. But if you're missing
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=13s)** — it, it can create a lot of problems. I think this video is valuable to identify all these kind of
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=19s)** — abstract symptoms that you may not connect with a zinc deficiency. Now typically people might know
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=27s)** — usually that a zinc deficiency can produce a loss of smell because of the concentration of zinc
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=33s)** — in the sinuses and also in the brain right behind it, which is called the olfactory bulb.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=38s)** — And also if a child is deficient in zinc early on, they're not going to be as tall. Okay,
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=44s)** — so they can have a lack of development. And of course, most people know that zinc is so
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=49s)** — important for the immune system. So if you're deficient, you're going to be more susceptible
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=52s)** — to having infections, especially respiratory infections, and especially viruses. They may also
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=59s)** — know that if zinc is deficient, the thyroid might not be able to convert T4 to T3, the active
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=66s)** — version of the thyroid hormone. And they may also know that it's related to hair loss or
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=71s)** — thinning of the hair and diarrhea, as well as dermatitis because of the concentration in
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=78s)** — And they may also know that it can create some mental agitation or irritation or even fatigue.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=84s)** — But I want to explain seven symptoms that not many people know about. So let's talk about
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=88s)** — number one. Okay, we talked about lack of smell, but let's talk about lack of taste. And
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=94s)** — I'm talking about when you eat food, you may find your food is just bland. It might taste
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=102s)** — more bitter. It might be more metallic. Number two is a lack of flavor, okay, which relates to
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=112s)** — something being bland. But with a zinc deficiency, you won't be able to perceive different
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=119s)** — flavors, which would really suck if you're trying to enjoy your food and everything is
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=124s)** — the same flavor. That would be devastating. So having enough zinc can help you perceive
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=133s)** — through your taste buds different flavors, which is very, very important in that perception
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=139s)** — that normally we're supposed to have. Number three, hypogonadism. Okay, so in other words,
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=146s)** — the testicle actually shrinks. It gets smaller, which is going to relate to a decreased
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=153s)** — testosterone. Okay, it's also going to relate to lower amounts of sperm because out of all the
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=160s)** — fluids in the body, a lot of the concentration of zinc is in the sperm for a survival mechanism
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=165s)** — and also to increase the quality of sperm. And so this could relate to infertility.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=172s)** — And low testosterone is a big deal with men. And so having enough zinc is a real nice way to
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=177s)** — make sure that your testosterone is at the right level. Number four, if we take the brain
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=183s)** — and we look at the areas of the brain that has the most concentrated zinc, the hippocampus
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=190s)** — comes up as number one. There's other parts of the brain. The hippocampus normally should
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=195s)** — have a lot of zinc. So if you're deficient in zinc, what can happen? What kind of symptoms
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=201s)** — could happen if the hippocampus can't work? Well, let me remember... what was that?
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=208s)** — Memory problems. An inability to learn. A problem with spatial location. All right,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=217s)** — number five, a higher susceptibility with an infection around your nail bed. So if you've
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=224s)** — had like this red swollen puffy tissue around your nails, that is a zinc deficiency. Since we're
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=233s)** — on the topic of nails, there are some other things too. Like you may have these little
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=237s)** — white dots. You may also have white lines that go horizontal. And they can actually
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=243s)** — have different shapes too. But if you see these little horizontal white streaks, that is
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=249s)** — All right, number six, a lack of repair. It takes forever for your body to repair
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=257s)** — after exercise, after an injury, any trauma. So zinc speeds up your body's ability to repair.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=267s)** — And number seven, night blindness. Now typically night blindness is associated with a vitamin A
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=272s)** — deficiency, but also zinc. Now I mentioned the hypothalamus being concentrated with zinc,
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=279s)** — but the retina is also part of the brain. And it too has a very concentrated amount of zinc.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=286s)** — So when you run out of that zinc, it can affect the retina, which is basically brain tissue
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=291s)** — that's extending out of your skull in your eyeball that allows you to see. And especially
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=298s)** — at night. Okay, so anyway, I wanted to cover these very important points. And I also want to
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=304s)** — mention why people are typically deficient in zinc. Usually it's because they're consuming
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=311s)** — too many refined carbohydrates in the form of sugar or pasta, or cereal especially, or bread.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=319s)** — Because not only does this concentrated carb deplete zinc, the phytic acid in the so-called
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=326s)** — healthy whole grains also blocks your ability to absorb zinc. So when you see things on
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=333s)** — the internet, it says whole grain bread or whole grain cereal, whatever, that brand is where
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=339s)** — the phytic acid is and that can block zinc. So you might say, well, okay, well, I won't do
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=346s)** — the whole grain, I'll do the refined grain. Well, then all that sugar can also deplete zinc
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=351s)** — in another way. There's a really simple way to find out if you're zinc deficient. You can buy
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=356s)** — a zinc test, which basically is a little bottle with a dropper full and it has some zinc in
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=362s)** — it. And you put about two teaspoons, I think it's 10 milliliters, okay, in your mouth and you hold it
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=369s)** — for 10 seconds. Now if you are deficient in zinc, you won't taste anything. It'll just be bland.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=377s)** — There'll be no taste. But if you have sufficient zinc, you'll start to notice it's
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=382s)** — going to taste metallic. There's a bitter taste to it. Now I've just talked about the symptoms
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=387s)** — of a zinc deficiency. Let's talk about the benefits of what could happen if you put the
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2T2Vd9utcs&t=393s)** — zinc back in. And for that information, I put it up right here. Check it out.
