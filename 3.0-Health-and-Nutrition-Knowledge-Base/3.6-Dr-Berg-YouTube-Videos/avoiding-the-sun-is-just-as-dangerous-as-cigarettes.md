- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=4s)** — Before you do that, just hear me out.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=7s)** — Avoiding the sun may be just as dangerous as smoking cigarettes.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=15s)** — Now, I know you probably think I'm exaggerating, but just hear me out.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=19s)** — There's an association between at least 17 different cancers and a vitamin D insufficiency
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=27s)** — and autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular disease.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=32s)** — Vitamin D is intimately involved in over 2,000 different genes.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=38s)** — Our immune system absolutely cannot work without vitamin D.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=42s)** — And check this out. It's virtually impossible to get your required vitamin D from your diet.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=47s)** — You're going to get between 5 to 10 percent.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=50s)** — And that's if you're consuming fatty fish, organ meats, egg yolks,
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=54s)** — which a lot of people don't even do that. 90 to 95 percent of vitamin D comes from the sun.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=61s)** — Now check out these statistics. There are over 5,000 deaths per year
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=67s)** — worldwide from too much sun. But look at how many people die from a lack of sun.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=74s)** — 1,684,677 people every single year.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=79s)** — So there's 329 times more people that are negatively affected by a lack of sun versus
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=87s)** — the actual exposure to sun.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=89s)** — This is based on a fascinating book called Embrace the Sun by Mark Sorensen,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=95s)** — who looked at and evaluated 1,300 different studies on the topic.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=100s)** — So they concluded that for every one person who dies from sun exposure,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=104s)** — there's 329 people who die of a lack of sun exposure.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=109s)** — Just think about the mainstream recommendation for sun by the American Dermatology Association.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=116s)** — You must stay out of the sun. And if you're out in the sun,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=119s)** — use sunblock because the sun is dangerous.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=122s)** — Even in the early 1900s, they had sanitariums that you can go to to bathe in the sun
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=130s)** — as a cure for TB and asthma and many different illnesses.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=137s)** — Well, what about melanoma, the deadly form of skin cancer?
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=142s)** — In 1935, one out of 1,500 people developed melanoma.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=147s)** — In 2014, one in 50 people developed melanoma.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=153s)** — And if we compare these two time periods, in the past, we got a lot more sun.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=157s)** — We were on the farm.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=159s)** — Nowadays, we're inside.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=161s)** — 75% of all melanomas are located in areas where we don't expose our skin to sun.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=169s)** — It's a lack of sun that puts someone at risk for melanoma.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=174s)** — And I'm not talking about being out in the sun and cooking yourself to the point
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=177s)** — where you're burned. You should never do that.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=179s)** — I'm talking about a moderate amount of sun so you'd never burn.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=182s)** — But there's something else the sun gives us for protection against cancer.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=188s)** — 7% of the sun is UV rays, 39% is visible spectrum of light,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=196s)** — and 54% of all the sun's rays are infrared potent stimulus of melatonin.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=205s)** — And 90% to 95% of all the melatonin is produced by this interaction between infrared
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=214s)** — and your skin.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=216s)** — And it increases the production of subcellular melatonin.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=220s)** — It's the melatonin that also enhances ATP.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=222s)** — So there's two things that protect the mitochondria, vitamin D and melatonin.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=227s)** — And both of them are triggered by the exposure to sun.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=230s)** — I do know there's going to be people that will disagree because we've been so indoctrinated
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=235s)** — into thinking that sun all of a sudden is really bad for us.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=238s)** — But I hope you could at least take a different viewpoint and just take a look at
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=243s)** — the information. I'm going to put the references down below.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=245s)** — Check it out.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=247s)** — I think your next step should be to start to get more sun exposure.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=250s)** — Be outside more often.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=252s)** — And on that note, if you have not seen my video on vitamin D,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDeLISqGgfs&t=256s)** — you might want to watch it. I put it up right here.
