- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about six main foods, well they are kind of categories of
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=4s)** — foods that can potentially cause cancer. There are some really key things you need to know.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=10s)** — Number one, it's the dose that determines the poison. Okay? And so the key with cancer
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=17s)** — is chronic exposure to a certain thing that can create inflammation and or dysfunction
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=24s)** — in a certain part of your cell. And that certain part is called the mitochondria. The mitochondria
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=30s)** — is the energy factory of your cells that uses oxygen to help burn fuel. With cancer, that
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=39s)** — mechanism is destroyed. Then you have a backup system that is used to keep things alive. And
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=46s)** — that system is called fermentation. Okay? So it's a whole different pathway that's set up,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=52s)** — that acts as a plan B for survival. And so when this shift happens, that cancer becomes out of
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=60s)** — control. It loses its mortality. It can live on forever. In this presentation, I'm not going to
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=66s)** — talk about all the different things that can feed cancer. I'm mainly going to focus in on
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=71s)** — the things that can trigger cancer. Let's talk about this chronic exposure. It can be chronic
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=75s)** — exposure to like pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, things like that.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=79s)** — I mean, just pesticides alone in the United States, we release 1.3 billion pounds of pesticides
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=86s)** — into our environment every single year. Let's say, for example, you do yard work and you're
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=90s)** — constantly involved with pesticides, you're doing farm work, you're definitely more
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=96s)** — susceptible to having more exposure and more chronic damage. But again, it's the dosage.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=101s)** — It's the chronic exposure of that poison. You have something called radon, which is kind of
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=107s)** — invisible odorless gas that can leak in from the soil from your basement. This is why when
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=114s)** — you buy a house, they check for radon because that can potentially lead to lung cancer.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=119s)** — You have cleaning chemicals. You have even old age is a risk factor. Why would old age be a
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=125s)** — risk factor? Well, over time, you kind of lose your mitochondria and become more damaged
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=130s)** — the time making you more susceptible to having this condition occur. Viruses like human papillomavirus
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=137s)** — and certain fungi, even parasites can do it. Even certain type of bacteria can trigger it.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=144s)** — And then of course you get pollution. All right, so now let's start at the top of the list.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=149s)** — Alcohol. Okay, no surprises there. Alcohol damages your mitochondria. But again, it's the
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=155s)** — chronic exposure of alcohol. Number two, trans fats. And a trans fat is something that's
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=161s)** — partially hydrogenated. Why would a hydrogenated oil, which is fully saturated, be any less
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=168s)** — damaging to a partially hydrogenated fat? So from my viewpoint, if you're getting
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=173s)** — hydrogenated fats, which is in a lot of junk foods, that can create a problem with
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=177s)** — your mitochondria. Number three, burnt or charred meat. There's two chemicals that are
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=184s)** — when you burn meat. HCA and PAH. Like on the charcoal grill. A couple of the things you can
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=191s)** — do to counter that. You can add garlic to your meats, rosemary, certain spices to help lower
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=199s)** — the risk factor. Then you have something else called AGEZ. What is AGEZ? It stands for Advanced
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=206s)** — Glycation and Products. What is that? That is a compound created when you combine a protein
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=213s)** — with a sugar under heat or a protein with a fat under heat. So a couple examples of that would
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=221s)** — be barbecued ribs. You're heating up these barbecued ribs and you're creating this advanced
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=226s)** — glycation and products. So there's kind of a situation where the protein fuses together
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=231s)** — and it can create all sorts of inflammatory processes, especially with your mitochondria.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=237s)** — Now what about heated protein and fats? Well you have ice cream. You cook this protein with the
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=245s)** — fat and you create these AGEZ. And then you're consuming this ice cream on a regular basis
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=250s)** — like a lot of people do. Number five, processed meats. You have nitrates in processed meats
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=256s)** — that are potentially associated with cancer. Usually people consuming processed meat are also
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=262s)** — consuming a lot of other things that are probably not healthy. But what they've done
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=266s)** — with this meat is they've combined red meat with processed meat and they lumped it into one
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=273s)** — category of both of those causing cancer. Which I have a big disagreement just because
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=277s)** — the research is so weak. And there's a big difference between grass-fed, grass-finished
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=284s)** — meat and grain-fed. There's a big difference between red meat and processed meat. And what
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=291s)** — if you eat red meat without nitrates? So anytime you look at things that cause cancer,
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=295s)** — you'll see that red meat stuck in there. And so that's one factor that I disagree with.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=300s)** — Especially since there's nothing in the healthy version of red meat that has been evaluated
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=307s)** — with any substantial scientific studies that show evidence of it being damaging at all. In
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=313s)** — fact, I know a lot of people heal their bodies by consuming red meat because there's
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=318s)** — a lot of things in there that are beneficial. All right, number six, ultra processed foods,
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=323s)** — aka junk foods. They rebranded junk foods as ultra processed foods. It sounds a lot better,
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=330s)** — but the actual foods are not a lot better. Now remember I talked about chronic exposure,
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=335s)** — right? Well, guess what? 50% of all of our calories are ultra processed foods.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=342s)** — When we talk about ultra, we're talking about extreme. We're talking about processed.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=347s)** — We're talking about turning something that started out natural into something that doesn't
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=352s)** — resemble what it started out to be. You're going through many, many alterations using
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=358s)** — chemicals, heat, pressure, deodorizing, decolorizing, and you're ending up with this
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=366s)** — end product that is so refined, so different, so altered, so dead, there's nothing alive in
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=375s)** — it. You know, people talk about, well, they're just empty calories. It's more than just
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=380s)** — And so when we consume it, we have to pull from our reserves vitamins and minerals to be able
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=387s)** — to metabolize it. And just think about how much inflammation is created when you're consuming
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=391s)** — synthetic starches. Not even saturated fats. They're unsaturated fats. They're seed oils,
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=398s)** — which go through industrial processing and a lot of refining, and they're very, very
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=402s)** — unstable. I can't think of anything more unhealthy to eat than ultra processed foods. It
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=407s)** — hits the bottom of the barrel. And what's really interesting about this is, let's start with
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=412s)** — maltodextrin. Maltodextrin is considered a starch, not a sugar, even though it reacts like
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=416s)** — a sugar, way more than actual sugar. On the glycemic index, it's way, way, way high.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=422s)** — And maltodextrin is an alter process ingredient that is considered generally recognized as safe.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=430s)** — It's called gross. Generally recognized as safe is something that a company can use. They can
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=436s)** — basically do their own studies and they can just tell the FDA, it's safe. There's no FDA
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=442s)** — testing on this. People think, oh yeah, it's been tested, but it's only tested by the
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=448s)** — manufacturing company. And there can be a lot of different shady loopholes with that. Maltodextrin
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=453s)** — is considered generally recognized as safe, gross. We have modified starches, which are
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=459s)** — gross. We even have high fructose corn syrup, which is gross. Corn oil, soy oil is considered
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=466s)** — gross. Canola oil is considered gross. Corn syrup is considered gross. And here we have the
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=472s)** — situation where manufacturers can kind of use this gross to give you the illusion that it's
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=478s)** — safe, when in fact, from my viewpoint, it's not too safe. Now, if you haven't seen my
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=483s)** — in-depth video on the most unhealthy food in the world, okay, you should check it out. I
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZPuEvVuTaw&t=489s)** — put it up right here.
