- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=0s)** — Today we're going to talk about a natural way to get rid of histamines.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=5s)** — Now, what's a histamine? A histamine is something developed when encountered with some type of
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=11s)** — thing that you're allergic to, also an injury or an infection. And the symptoms are the following.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=19s)** — Mucus, sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, red eyes. And so whether you have seasonal allergies
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=26s)** — or some other type of inflammatory condition, it might be a good idea to know more about how
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=31s)** — to speed up this process and get rid of these histamines. Now, unfortunately, histamines are
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=37s)** — also in the food supply too. So unknowingly, you could be consuming histamines and aggravating
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=44s)** — the condition. But there are certain organs that have enzymes to help you dismantle and break
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=52s)** — histamines. And the first one is called diamine oxidase. We're just going to call it DAO. So
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=58s)** — this enzyme is located in the small intestine as well as your kidney. Now, it's in the small
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=64s)** — intestine because of all the histamines you get from foods. So you need this enzyme to
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=69s)** — help break it down. But it's also in the kidney. And another enzyme, which is fairly a
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=75s)** — chemical compound, HNMT stands for histamine N-methyl transferase. Not that you needed to know
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=84s)** — that, but this enzyme also breaks down histamine and it's located in your liver,
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=88s)** — it's in your lungs, and it's even in your central nervous system. And so if we look at
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=94s)** — these histamines, the liver and kidney are probably the most important organs. The liver
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=99s)** — receives a tremendous amount of blood flow, just like the kidneys. In fact, one third of
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=104s)** — all the blood in your entire body travels through the liver every minute. And so anything that
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=110s)** — inhibits liver function can be a problem. So this relates to like, you know, junk foods,
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=117s)** — alcohol, or even smoking can actually kind of make things worse. So the two central good
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=124s)** — remedies for dealing with histamines would be getting some grass-fed beef kidney extract,
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=132s)** — as well as grass-fed beef liver extract. Now if you can find these in a freeze-dried form,
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=140s)** — that would be best because you'll have the maximum amount of these enzymes,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=144s)** — plus a lot of other additional things that will help detoxification. I mean, you have
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=149s)** — selenium, you have antioxidants, you have nutrients that will all help speed up the
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=155s)** — process. Now the other remedy that I'm going to recommend would be milk thistle. So the
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=160s)** — compound in milk thistle is called silymarin. And that compound not only is great in protecting
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=168s)** — the liver and other organs from poisons, like snake bites, poisonous mushrooms, certain drugs
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=176s)** — that can poison you, but milk thistle has been known to help anaphylactic shock, which is a
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=183s)** — allergic reaction. So it's great in any allergies. Now since histamines come from a certain immune
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=190s)** — cell called the mast cell, milk thistle stabilizes the membrane around the mast cell,
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=198s)** — decreasing histamines directly, and then avoiding the foods high in histamine. And that would
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=204s)** — be anything fermented, as in alcohol, like beer, wine, other alcohol beverages. This includes
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=212s)** — fermented dairy, as in aged cheeses, cream cheese, yogurt, kefir, things like that. I would also
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=219s)** — avoid fermented vegetables like sauerkraut or kimchi, even though I usually recommend them.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=224s)** — But if you're in a histamine reaction, you should probably avoid them. Other fermented
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=229s)** — products would be like bread, vinegar, which includes apple cider vinegar, steered meats.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=235s)** — Okay, I would avoid those. And then other things like smoked meats and smoked fish,
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=241s)** — shellfish, spinach, and even chocolate. All of these are high in histamine. So if you avoid these,
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=246s)** — you're going to have less of a reaction and you can overcome this a lot faster. Now if
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=250s)** — you haven't seen my other very popular video on mucus, you might want to check that out. I
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpF65KLQUHY&t=255s)** — put it up right here.
