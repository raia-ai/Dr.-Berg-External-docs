- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=0s)** — We can learn a lot about the number one selling drug in the world. Now, I'm not going to tell
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=6s)** — people not to take this drug. I'm not going to tell people to take it. And I'm definitely
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=11s)** — not here to get in the middle of you and your doctor with this medication. But if I had this
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=16s)** — particular illness and needed this drug and I was told about this drug, I would want some
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=21s)** — additional information. And that's what I'm going to share with you today. This drug is projected
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=26s)** — to produce over $27 billion at the end of this year, 2024. And it's a cancer drug. And it's very
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=37s)** — unique in that it's creating a paradigm shift in oncology. Because what it does is it actually
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=43s)** — targets a very specific thing for certain types of cancer, not all of cancer. It's called
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=48s)** — precision medicine. So it's not a broad-based antibiotic or like chemotherapy. It's very
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=55s)** — targeted to this one thing. It releases the brakes on your own immune system. Cancer is
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=65s)** — always trying to evade your immune system. This specific drug is called ketruta, which
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=72s)** — does something to block that mechanism and allows your own immune system to be able to
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=79s)** — tag and see where the cancer cells are so they can kill it. So that's one thing I
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=84s)** — like about this strategy is that you're getting your own immune system to do the work. It's like
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=90s)** — training this elite special forces to do a very specific job to attack a very specific
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=98s)** — invader. They also use this drug for autoimmune diseases, infections, and cancer.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=105s)** — I like this strategy better if you have the type of cancer that this can help you with,
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=110s)** — versus chemotherapy, which kills off cancer and your immune system. It pretty much wipes
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=116s)** — everything out. We're dealing with something called immunomodulation. This is something that
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=121s)** — either increases or decreases or blocks your immune system. There are quite a few side effects
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=130s)** — as I'm going to scroll down. You can see all the different side effects. There's many. So it
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=135s)** — doesn't come without its problems. Now the other problem with this drug is that it doesn't
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=142s)** — work on all types of cancer. Cancer is very diverse. In other words, there are certain
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=146s)** — cancers that don't even have the specific pathway for this to deal with. And cancer
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=152s)** — has a super ability to also adapt. The cancer cells that are remaining from that insult,
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=158s)** — they become resistant, they become super strong, and they can go out of control.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=163s)** — Similar to taking an antibiotic, these microbes resist that and become stronger. Now you have
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=168s)** — these superbugs. Also, this drug does not address the fuel for the cancer, or doesn't
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=175s)** — block the raw materials that it needs to build cancer cells. And the drug doesn't address
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=181s)** — the microenvironment where this cancer lives. I think an approach that uses multiple strategies
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=188s)** — at the same time just would be really smart if you have cancer. So the first question is,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=195s)** — is there anything natural that is in an immunomodulator? And the answer is yes. There
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=201s)** — are a lot of different natural remedies that help to increase or decrease the immune system.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=208s)** — In fact, this is how a lot of drug companies get their ideas and develop patents for
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=213s)** — research in the area of plant chemicals. If I'm not mistaken, I think it's over 50%
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=219s)** — of all drugs are derivatives of something that came from nature. So we have astragalus.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=225s)** — Okay, that's very potent. We have the reishi mushroom. There's also other types of mushrooms
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=231s)** — too that deal with cancer. And then of course you just have vitamin D in relationship to
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=235s)** — cancer. And think about what vitamin D does as in an immunomodulator. I mean, I personally
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=239s)** — take 20,000 I use of vitamin D3 every single day, especially if someone's dealing with
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=244s)** — autoimmunity type problem or inflammation. I would also address the diet. I would do things
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=250s)** — to avoid fueling the cancer cell. I would also do fasting because that is the most powerful
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=258s)** — thing to help starve off cancer. And if you can't do prolonged fasting, you can do the
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=264s)** — mimicking diet, okay, which is a bit easier. And you would do that for five days, once a month,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=270s)** — maybe every three weeks. And also there's something that medicine doesn't really get
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=274s)** — into. It's the mindset. I personally know people who are very strong willed. They're
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=279s)** — not going down with cancer. There's a reason why when the doctor says you have this
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=284s)** — amount of time to live that there's a high correlation between the person only living
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=289s)** — that amount of time because somehow that gets in your mind and you agree with it. And then all
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=293s)** — of a sudden that happens. But I think it's really, really important to disagree with cancer and
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=300s)** — basically say, you know, I'm going to survive no matter what I'm going to make it happen.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=304s)** — There are also nutritional protocols to help starve cancer. And if you have not seen my
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=310s)** — video that I recently did, I cover all the protocols and what you need to do. And I put
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeCwKDdWyM&t=315s)** — that video right here. Check it out.
