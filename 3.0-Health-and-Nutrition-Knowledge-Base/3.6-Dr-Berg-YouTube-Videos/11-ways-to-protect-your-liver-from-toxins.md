- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=0s)** — So there's one cell in your body that takes a beating. It does the majority of detoxification.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=7s)** — And that cell is called the hepatocyte. And hepatocytes are liver cells. So your liver is the main detoxification organ of the entire body.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=17s)** — To a lesser degree, the kidneys help you detoxify, the small intestine helps you detoxify, the skin can help you detoxify, and even your fat cells can help to some degree detoxify.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=29s)** — But it's that liver that takes a beating. So today we're going to talk about how to make sure your liver is doing its job.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=37s)** — But I want to give you some solutions that are simple, easy changes to protect yourself.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=42s)** — But you do need to be aware of the quantity of chemicals that we are swimming in every day.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=49s)** — Because they do affect us in a negative way, but it's hard to pinpoint one thing versus another because there are so many chemicals and variables.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=57s)** — It's very hard to test for this. I mean, think about this. We have 27 trillion pounds of chemicals that are produced or imported from other places to the U.S. every single year.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=70s)** — That's 74 billion pounds every single day, which comes out to about 250 pounds of chemicals per person.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=79s)** — So there is a lot of exposure of chemicals. Now, you might say, well, I live a pretty clean life and I'm not really exposed to chemicals.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=86s)** — It doesn't include fuels, doesn't include pesticides. It doesn't even include the chemicals in your food.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=94s)** — And I'm not even including the poisons. I'm sorry, did I say poisons? I meant medications from health care.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=101s)** — I mean, it's just bizarre to me that if we think about health care, well, that's just another way we're exposed to more chemicals to suppress symptoms.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=111s)** — I mean, really what's missing in health care is the health part. I mean, what is in health care that's actually creating more health?
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=118s)** — These chemicals, they build up a half-life and some of these chemicals can be from weeks to years to decades.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=125s)** — And a half-life of the substance is that you're reducing the potency of something by 50% over a period of time.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=133s)** — So it becomes less activated. And a lot of times they'll measure the half-life of certain chemicals.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=139s)** — Okay, the book on toxicology. You can see there's actually quite a few toxins in our environment and a lot of information on it.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=146s)** — But the half-life of a lot of these chemicals are measured usually through the blood, not necessarily through your tissues, the cells outside the blood, which is a whole different thing.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=157s)** — We definitely need to do three things. We need to be aware of the chemicals. We need to reduce the exposure to the chemicals.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=162s)** — And we definitely need to increase the ability to detoxify the chemicals.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=168s)** — And the main support needs to be to the hepatocyte, that liver cell.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=173s)** — And now a lot of these chemicals in the environment act like estrogen.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=177s)** — Okay, so they're called estrogen disruptors or even endocrine disruptors, because what they do to the endocrine system, they can act and mimic like your hormones.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=188s)** — And so they can really throw off the thyroid, the adrenals, the pituitary, all these different hormonal pathways.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=195s)** — And there's definitely a direct connection between what those chemicals do and how they damage the DNA, how they alter the DNA.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=201s)** — They can mutate and change the DNA and they create a lot of diseases, a lot of oxidation and free radical damage.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=208s)** — And of course, this free radical damage can create a whole cascade of problems.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=212s)** — And this is why antioxidants help to counter that.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=216s)** — Our bodies make antioxidants and we also can get antioxidants from food.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=221s)** — Now, another really interesting thing about certain chemicals in foods that can help us detoxify is the fact that we already have the machinery, the enzymes within our bodies.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=235s)** — OK, we have certain enzymes that can turn poisons into harmless particles, but they can become activated by certain things in our foods.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=245s)** — So sometimes we have this idea that it's just the antioxidants that are kind of countering the oxidation, but also they're activating something that we already have inside.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=255s)** — We just need to turn on those genes to do the job a little bit better.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=259s)** — And I just had my DNA tested and apparently I also have certain detoxifying genes that are not working like they should.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=267s)** — So I have to work harder at getting them to work.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=271s)** — So there's a group of enzymes that are called the cytochrome P450 enzymes.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=277s)** — And there's this whole biochemical pathway that goes from phase one, phase two, phase three, that helps to turn these poisons into things that are harmless.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=286s)** — So the majority of that occurs in that hepatocyte, but it does incur in other places in the body.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=292s)** — So I'm going to be going through things that we can do to minimize exposure to the poisons, what you can do to activate them,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=299s)** — and also the number one food that will help you activate these enzymes that you already have.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=305s)** — All we have to do is trigger them.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=306s)** — We have toxins and pollution from the air, from the water, from the food, from beauty products, right?
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=315s)** — Oceans, shampoo, hair gels, conditioners, hair dyes, etc., etc.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=321s)** — We need to make sure those are as clean as possible.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=325s)** — This is kind of good on the list and just talk about air pollution.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=328s)** — I would highly recommend getting some type of filter.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=331s)** — There's one good one called Merv VIII, and that can be very essential if you live in polluted areas,
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=336s)** — especially if you live in the city.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=337s)** — You want that air filter to minimize the amount of chemicals, and that can make a big difference in your exposure.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=344s)** — Number two, growing certain plants that can help soak up chemicals like benzene and formaldehyde
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=353s)** — and many of the other chemicals in the air. So it's not a very expensive thing to just
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=357s)** — have more plants in your house. And I'm going to put a video down below of what plants I
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=362s)** — would recommend. Spending more time in nature is very, very therapeutic from just breathing
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=368s)** — in healthy air. All right, what about a water filter? Do you have a shower filter?
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=373s)** — Do you have a water filter? You definitely need to get one. The amount of crap that's in our water.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=379s)** — I mean, even chlorine. Yes, chlorine will kill off pathogens, but on the flip side, it can
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=386s)** — increase the risk of cancer. So we have chlorine, we have fluoride, we have all these other
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=391s)** — chemicals in the water. So you need to get a water filter and they don't have to be expensive.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=396s)** — I mean, a really simple, relatively inexpensive water filter. And you get all different kinds.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=400s)** — You can get it from the shower or a pitcher or under the counter or over the counter.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=405s)** — Just go to Zero Water. I'll put a link down below. I'm not affiliated with them, but they
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=409s)** — have a good system. They have three ways of getting rid of chemicals. The carbon filter,
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=413s)** — they have one that binds to heavy metals, and they have another filter that will help
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=418s)** — reduce other things like chloride and fluoride and things like that. Now, another really
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=423s)** — important thing is fish. Okay, always it's wild caught. Farm raised fish are loaded with
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=429s)** — okay, just more chemicals. You want to do wild caught. And you definitely want to consume the
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=434s)** — fish that are smaller. You don't want to consume the big fish. Like avoid swordfish,
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=440s)** — shark, tuna. These fish accumulate a lot of mercury because they tend to eat smaller fish
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=448s)** — that eat smaller fish. So there's a much higher concentration of mercury, like sometimes up to
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=452s)** — a thousand times more. And that mercury can accumulate in your body. But with the smaller
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=456s)** — fish, there's much, much less mercury and the selenium can bind to the mercury that's in there
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=462s)** — and inactivate it. So it's not a problem. Now, what about organic vegetables? Absolutely.
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=467s)** — Let's say you just can't afford organic. You can break down a considerable amount of
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=473s)** — organophosphates by using apple cider vinegar and water. You just put a fourth of a cup
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=478s)** — of apple cider vinegar and a gallon of water and wash your vegetables. You can remove a lot
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=484s)** — chemicals just by that simple procedure. So organic food is without pesticides and it is
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=490s)** — more nutrient dense. Now I already mentioned the chemical free beauty products. So many people
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=496s)** — are exposing their bodies, deodorants and hand creams, and they're not really reading the
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=501s)** — label. These things accumulate. They go into the liver. The next thing I would really avoid
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=506s)** — is canned foods. Canned foods greatly increase things called BPAs. And I'm not going to
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=513s)** — get into the technicalities of them, but if you go through this book right here and look at the
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=519s)** — section of BPAs, you're going to find that they create a lot of problems with your endocrine
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=524s)** — system. They're endocrine disruptors and you're going to get a lot of them if you're
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=528s)** — consistently eating canned foods, especially those soups. So I would just avoid canned foods
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=533s)** — or if you do consume them, don't consume them often. All right. So let's bring up the
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=538s)** — number one food to help strengthen and trigger the detoxifying enzymes in the hepatocyte,
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=548s)** — the liver cell. And that is cruciferous vegetables. Now there's a lot of other things
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=553s)** — that will do it too, like garlic, for example. Onion will do it. Oregano. But the
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=559s)** — cruciferous family of vegetables are potent inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes. And
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=567s)** — there's a tremendous amount of research on this. It's hardcore data. Those foods consumed
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=570s)** — on a regular basis can help to not just pull chemicals out, but they also provide a lot of
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=577s)** — other benefits. Anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer. Now every time you deal with toxins or free
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=584s)** — radicals or antioxidants, people always think about plants, right? Because we all know that
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=592s)** — these antioxidants are not in, you know, meats. Well, that's not actually true. I recently was
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=599s)** — involved in a study sending my beef from my farm into a study. Okay. It's called the beef
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=607s)** — nutrient density study. I just want to show you this one graph right here.
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=612s)** — I don't know if you can see this. See this, this green bar right here. Okay. Right there.
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=616s)** — Versus the blue bar versus the other colored bar right here. I think it's pink.
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=622s)** — So right here we have Dr. Berg's beef, and then we have other farmers on average of the
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=628s)** — grass fed beef, and then we have the grain fed beef. Now what this is evaluating
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=635s)** — is phytonutrients. These are plant based chemicals, plant based chemicals in beef.
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=641s)** — Now the healthier the beef, the more you're going to have these plant based chemicals
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=646s)** — that can act as antioxidants and create a lot of other health benefits. But you can see there
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=651s)** — are definitely more, if you compare grain fed to grass fed, definitely more. But the healthier
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=656s)** — the beef, like I do grass fed grass finished. Okay. And I really take care of my cattle.
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=663s)** — So you can see the amount of phytonutrients. This would be a great substitute for vegetables.
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=670s)** — If you have gut problems, right? Because there's definitely an increase in people doing carnivore
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=677s)** — because of their gut issues. And people will say, well, you can't get all the nutrients from
- **[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=681s)** — beef or other types of organ meats. Well, apparently you can, but I really think it's the
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=685s)** — quality. Well, this just proves it. It's the quality of meat. You're not going to go down to
- **[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=690s)** — the local Safeway grocery store and get deli meat and think you're going to be getting
- **[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=697s)** — those phytonutrients. You're going to have to go to the farmer's market or you're going to have
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=701s)** — to get grass fed grass finished to really get the full health benefits of these products.
- **[11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=708s)** — Is the animal being fed grains? Okay. Or grass and weeds grown on healthy soils.
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=715s)** — So we have the cruciferous vegetables like the kale, the broccoli, the arugula,
- **[11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=719s)** — the radish, all those are very, very key. But you also have all the herbs too that can
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=725s)** — And then we have things that contain B vitamins that can help you detoxify. I did a whole video
- **[12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=731s)** — on that. It's actually a very interesting video, which I'll put a link down below.
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=734s)** — And then we have minerals that help you detoxify like selenium, like in Brazil nuts,
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=739s)** — very important to help increase glutathione, which is another enzyme to help break down
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=745s)** — poisons and your gut microbiome is so important in supporting detoxification. If you don't have
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=754s)** — the full diversity of your gut microbes, that's going to limit your ability to get
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=758s)** — rid of poisons. So start consuming foods with microbes like sauerkraut, kimchi,
- **[12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=763s)** — kefir, very important. The next thing I want to talk about is fasting. When you fast,
- **[12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=768s)** — especially periodic prolonged fasting, you increase your own body's network of antioxidants.
- **[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=777s)** — You strengthen and turn on the genes that help you detoxify. Your liver starts increasing its
- **[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=786s)** — capacity to get rid of poisons. You go through what's called autophagy, which is
- **[13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=792s)** — the recycling of old damaged proteins and getting rid of pathogens, strengthening the
- **[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=798s)** — systems that help keep you clean. I had this really bizarre thought. I would love to go into
- **[13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=805s)** — nursing homes and just replace their food, just to see what would happen to the health
- **[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=810s)** — of these elderly people. I think the need for medications would go way down and it would
- **[13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=818s)** — probably just be miraculous. But unfortunately, I just found something out that's pretty

- **[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=827s)** — even hospitals that they have to eat every 14 hours and they have to have these certain
- **[13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=833s)** — foods, which I'm looking at being not very, very healthy. So I think it'd be very difficult,
- **[13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=839s)** — unfortunately, to put them on some type of intermittent fasting program, which is exactly
- **[14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=843s)** — what they need and actually have them eat food that came from the farm. That would be just
- **[14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=848s)** — awesome. But if you have the ability to do intermittent fasting, do it. It's going to help

- **[14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=859s)** — exercise, you stimulate genes that help you detoxify. But if you over train, you're going to
- **[14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=866s)** — really shut down the systems to get rid of toxins. Because think about it, when you
- **[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=869s)** — exercise, you're generating a lot of free radical damage and oxidation from just the
- **[14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=877s)** — metabolism of pushing yourself. So that requires a strong, robust antioxidant system. There are
- **[14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=883s)** — like grapefruit and grapefruit juice and St. John's wort that inhibit that detoxification

- **[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=901s)** — in their body. And I'm not telling you not to consume them. I'm just telling you that
- **[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac1rrcr6xhY&t=906s)** — they do tend to slow down the elimination of poisons. There's a very interesting video
