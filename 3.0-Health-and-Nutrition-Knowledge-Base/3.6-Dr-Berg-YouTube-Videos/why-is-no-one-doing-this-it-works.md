- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=0s)** — Today I'm excited to show you something really cool. To be able to take flabby arms and tone them up.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=5s)** — And I'm going to go through about eight or nine different exercises.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=9s)** — Some people are not going to be able to do certain exercises. I'm going to start really small and then increase from there.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=14s)** — I want you to select the ones that make sense to you. When I do my workouts, I'm not very structured.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=19s)** — I get bored really easy with exercises. I think it's important to switch it up.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=22s)** — I'm going to show you a series of exercises that you can pick or choose which ones that will fit into your routine.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=27s)** — As we age, the muscles in our arms start to atrophy. The fascia that surrounds the arm.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=34s)** — Fascia is this stuff right here. Saran wrap. The tissue that we recently identified as being way more important than what we thought it was.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=42s)** — Because fascia surrounds our entire body like a wetsuit. But not just the outside. In the different layers of muscles.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=48s)** — Around the nerves, around the organs. It really gives the shape of the arm and around your whole body.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=53s)** — It holds everything together. It also shares some of the forces that you put on your body when you exercise.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=59s)** — When you stimulate the fascia, you actually cause collagen synthesis or a rebuilding effect.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=66s)** — What we want as we age is to thicken that collagen layer and make it so it can tighten everything up really nicely.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=72s)** — In the last video I did on toning the arm, we talked mainly about a stretching technique.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=77s)** — Today we're going to focus more on a strengthening technique.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=80s)** — In this video we're not just going to focus on the primary muscles like the biceps and the triceps.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=87s)** — The biceps cause your arm to go this way. The triceps extends your arm that way.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=92s)** — We're not just going to focus on those muscles even though those are the primary movers of the arm.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=97s)** — There are a lot of other associated supportive muscles that have to be toned as well.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=102s)** — We will handle the primary muscles, all the secondary and supporting muscles, and the fascia all with one type of exercise.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=111s)** — This exercise is very safe on the joints. It's going to produce a lot of strength, reshape your arm, it's going to help put tone in the arm.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=118s)** — It's not going to involve a lot of expensive equipment or even going to the gym.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=121s)** — And from what I evaluated, I think this is the best exercise for the arms that you can do hands down.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=127s)** — Most of the exercises we're going to talk about are isometric exercises.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=131s)** — Now what's an isometric exercise? It's an exercise that involves increasing tension in the muscle without lengthening or shortening a muscle.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=140s)** — And if we want to stimulate the primary muscles, the secondary muscles, the associated supporting muscles, and the fascia,
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=146s)** — we want to add as much tension as we can to make changes in the arm.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=151s)** — These exercises might really appear to be very simple, but wow, they really make you sore.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=156s)** — We have the isometric exercise and then we have another exercise.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=160s)** — When you contract your muscle, this is called a concentric movement.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=164s)** — When you extend the muscle and you lengthen the muscle, that's called eccentric movement.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=170s)** — And so some of these exercises that we're going to show you are going to involve this eccentric motion, this lengthening the muscle very slowly under tension.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=179s)** — Why do we want to do that? Because it produces very fast results. It's very safe in the joint.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=183s)** — It's fairly easy to do versus going to the gym and doing this two-dimensional exercise like this.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=189s)** — You're only going to work those primary movers. You're not going to work everything else.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=193s)** — As far as the equipment for the exercises, it would be great if you had a band like this.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=198s)** — There's also going to be another piece of equipment that you may want to get.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=201s)** — It's not that expensive, but it's called an isometric band.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=204s)** — I'm also going to demonstrate a few things on the TRX, which I will show you really quick.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=209s)** — Those are not that expensive either. Or if you have some gymnastic rings, I have those as well.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=214s)** — I personally like those, but you don't really need to do these exercises on those. You can just use the TRX.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=218s)** — And even if you don't have any of those, I'm going to still show you what to do without using anything. Just using your body weight.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=223s)** — I'm excited about a new product we just released called Tudka.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=227s)** — Tudka is a special type of bile salt that helps to clean the liver, the gallbladder and the tubes connecting between the two.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=234s)** — One indication that you might need some Tudka is a full sensation underneath the right rib cage that sometimes refers up to the right shoulder or upper trap area.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=243s)** — Tudka basically thins the bile sludge and greatly assists in the digestion of fats.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=249s)** — Take two on an empty stomach either once or twice a day, depending on how severe you have the problem.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=254s)** — In this first exercise, it's real simple. You put this band around your neck.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=257s)** — As you can see in this video, the person is extending their arm, hold it in this position where you're bent over for 20 seconds and do three sets of that.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=268s)** — This is primarily going to work the back of the arm.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=270s)** — This next one I really like as well because you can actually put this band right on top of your door.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=276s)** — And then you can actually bring it down halfway and hold that position.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=281s)** — This is an isometric exercise to really also build the back of the arm.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=285s)** — And again, for all of these exercises, just to make it really easy, I would hold them for a count of 20.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=291s)** — If you can do that, if not, do it less, like do 10 seconds and then with a 10 second rest and just do it three different times.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=298s)** — In this next video, I really like this guy because Matt Schifferle does a lot of great isometrics.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=303s)** — He has several books that I have. I really like the way that he explains things.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=307s)** — Overcoming isometrics are where we're trying to push or pull against an immovable object.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=311s)** — That way the amount of resistance against your body is always equal to the amount of force you're putting into it.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=317s)** — The anterior chain is all the muscles in the front part of the body.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=319s)** — The posterior chain is all the muscles on the back part of your body.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=322s)** — And the lateral chain is all the muscles on the side of the body.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=326s)** — There's three really cool isometric exercises that you can do to just maximize your tension in your muscles to really tone those arms.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=337s)** — Let's listen to what he has to say.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=338s)** — This is why I'm particularly excited about the new isometrics that I've been doing.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=342s)** — Because they include both resistance against gravity plus an overcoming aspect where you can put as much force as possible into your muscles.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=351s)** — And it's always going to match you.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=352s)** — So let me show you some of the exercises you can try with this.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=356s)** — The best ways to do this are for the three support chains.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=360s)** — Your flexion or anterior chain, posterior extension chain, and your lateral chains.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=365s)** — So we start off with our squeezing plank where we get into hollow body and then we're into a plank.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=373s)** — So that's our yielding isometric aspect.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=376s)** — But then if we squeeze the floor between our hands and our feet.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=383s)** — Now you can kind of hear in my voice I'm shaking a little bit.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=386s)** — I can feel my core going nuts.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=389s)** — And now the amount of work in my muscles is dramatically increased.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=394s)** — You can also do the same thing for your backside of your body with a squeezing table bridge.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=399s)** — So we've got our shoulders packed down and back.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=402s)** — Right. And then we lift up.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=405s)** — And then again we squeeze the floor together between our feet and our hands.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=411s)** — My hamstrings and my glutes are going absolutely crazy to make that happen.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=418s)** — The first couple times I did that my hamstrings cramped up really quickly.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=422s)** — So feel free to apply a little bit less force the first time you try that.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=427s)** — Here's another exercise. I really like this one as well.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=429s)** — We're going to take a band underneath your feet and you're going to pull up your arm halfway.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=435s)** — This is going to work the bicep. This is called isometric bicep curl.
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=439s)** — For this next one it's a little bit different.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=441s)** — And this is called an eccentric movement where we're going to take some weight.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=446s)** — You can use a dumbbell or on a bar.
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=448s)** — And then you're going to bring it up and then slowly, slowly bring it back downward,
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=454s)** — lengthening the bicep.
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=455s)** — This is going to work your front part of your bicep.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=458s)** — And this might look pretty easy, but it's not.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=460s)** — And you're going to feel really sore after you do it.
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=462s)** — I would recommend do this maybe starting out only five times.
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=467s)** — But the key is to let it down really slow and gradually.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=470s)** — For this next one you're going to need something called an isometric band.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=474s)** — You can get these on Amazon. They're not that expensive.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=477s)** — And you're going to be doing an isometric pushing your arms over your head.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=482s)** — And so this is another arm exercise that kind of graduates into working your shoulders as well.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=487s)** — Let's dive into this video. I think Matt will explain it very thoroughly.
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=490s)** — Employ what I like to call the PTR principle, position, tension, resistance.
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=494s)** — Don't just jump in and be like, okay, here we go.
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=497s)** — Instead, take your time setting up for the position to make sure everything's where you
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=503s)** — want it to be. You've got good alignment because a lot of isometrics are full body exercises.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=508s)** — So elbows in good position, hands in good position.
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=511s)** — Then proactively engage the muscles you want to be working.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=516s)** — And then finally, apply the resistance against the handles or whatever equipment that you're using.
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=522s)** — This ensures that you have proper position, but also good tension control in the muscles you want to be using.
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=529s)** — And then you apply the resistance.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=531s)** — If you apply the resistance too quickly and then think, oh yeah, that's right, my hands need to be
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=536s)** — in a little bit or wait a minute, my tension in my abs isn't quite engaged enough.
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=541s)** — It's a little bit harder to get that stuff really dialed in once you're already working.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=547s)** — So even just a moment of position, tension, and then you apply the resistance can go a long
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=554s)** — way at making the exercises safer, more comfortable, and a lot more effective.
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=558s)** — Stability is also a very important factor because you're only as strong as you are stable.
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=563s)** — And if you're really fighting to stabilize your body during an exercise, that's less energy and
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=569s)** — effort you can put into actually working the muscles. So in particular, if you're using
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=573s)** — something like the ISO trainer or something, and you notice that when you apply force against
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=579s)** — your feet, there's coming in or you're a little bit on a narrow, unstable surface.
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=586s)** — And that's why I highly recommend running a strap or the equipment you're using underneath some sort
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=592s)** — of a platform like an aerobic step or a plyo box or something. Now I'm going to have a lot
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=598s)** — more stability with the straps and my feet are on a very stable platform. They're not getting
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=603s)** — pulled inwards or outwards. And I can really put a lot more force directly into the muscles
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=610s)** — without worrying about compromises to my stability. And lastly, don't forget that the
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=615s)** — point of any strength training endeavor is to adequately work the muscles, not to
- **[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=621s)** — necessarily lift the weight or move the cable around. And the same is true for isometrics.
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=626s)** — Your goal is not to put as much force as possible into your handles. The goal is to
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=631s)** — contract the muscles as hard as possible. And you may find that this is going to be easier
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=636s)** — if you don't try to always have your maximum absolute amount of force that you're applying
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=642s)** — into your equipment. So as you're using that rise time, give yourself permission to only apply
- **[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=649s)** — 75-80% of the effort you have. You don't need to max out all the time. And I'm contracting
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=656s)** — or focusing on contracting my biceps and my back very, very hard as opposed to trying to
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=664s)** — just pull on the straps. That way you're putting your effort into creating a stronger
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=670s)** — stimulus in the muscle itself versus just trying to see how hard you can pull against the handle,
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=675s)** — which might lead to all sorts of compensation in your technique. Other muscle groups are really
- **[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=681s)** — trying to overkill things. You do definitely want to have everything working. This is a
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=686s)** — full body exercise. There's just emphasis in the biceps. And if you find that you can do
- **[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=691s)** — that with a little less than maximum force, you're probably going to be better off for it.
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGRKrUPIpfU&t=696s)** — If you want to learn more, check out my book, Overcoming Isometrics. The links to that in the
