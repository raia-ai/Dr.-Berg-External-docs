- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=0s)** — You know, the worst food for your teeth is not sugar. Now it is true that sugar does increase
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=6s)** — bacteria that make more acids that can erode your teeth, but there's a much worse type of acid
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=12s)** — that will severely erode your teeth and it doesn't have anything to do with sugar. Of course,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=19s)** — if we talk about fruit juice, like apple juice or orange juice is five times worse than soda
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=27s)** — Yeah, interesting. And I'm going to explain why that is in just a minute.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=31s)** — Diet soda compared to regular soda. Can you take a guess what's worse for your teeth?
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=37s)** — Believe it or not, diet soda might be worse. And I'm going to explain why that is as well.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=43s)** — Number two, candy. The stuff that you suck on, like a lollipop, for example,
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=47s)** — you're constantly exposing your teeth to a lot of sugar and that can definitely create microbes
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=52s)** — that make more acid. Number three, powdered starches. Starches can act just like a sugar
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=59s)** — and feed these microbes and create the acids. And that would be like modified food
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=64s)** — starch or modified cornstarch or maltodextrin, which is in pretty much most junk foods.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=70s)** — And then we just get liquid sugar, as in high fructose corn syrup drinks, right?
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=75s)** — And I'm talking about the ones that you have added sugar. In this case, you're not chewing,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=80s)** — you're just bathing the teeth in just pure sugar. And just if we differentiate between natural
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=86s)** — sugars, like if you eat fruit versus drink the juice from fruit, especially if it's
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=92s)** — pasteurized, there's a big difference. And then number five, we get into actual sodas
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=97s)** — with phosphoric acid. And believe it or not, phosphoric acid is not the worst acid for your
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=103s)** — teeth. There's another one that's actually way more dangerous, but phosphoric acid is not
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=108s)** — good. It's going to leach the calcium out of your teeth. So here you have a soda with not
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=113s)** — just liquid candy syrup, like high fructose corn syrup, but also the phosphoric acid.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=120s)** — But there's something else in there, which I'm getting to very shortly. Number six is like
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=125s)** — the gummy bears. It sticks to your teeth. So now we have the situation where we take the sugar
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=132s)** — and we stick it to the teeth and we keep the exposure there longer, which is going to
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=137s)** — increase more bacterial fermentation and more acid. And you also have the caramel too,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=143s)** — and different candies that are sticky, but the gummy bears are at the top of the list.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=147s)** — Now there's other things too that people will talk about, like acid reflux coming up and
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=152s)** — ending up on your teeth. Of course, that's still not the acid that I'm going to talk
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=157s)** — about. The acid that is the worst for your teeth... and I'm going to just read this off
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=164s)** — some of this sugar water right here and see if I could see this right here. It says water,
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=170s)** — sugar, dextrose, and citric acid. That is the worst thing for your teeth. Citric acid.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=178s)** — Now, citric acid, isn't that a natural thing? Yeah, it's in lemons and limes and things
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=184s)** — like that, but they also make it synthetically. And apparently what's unique about citric acid
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=189s)** — is that it's a very powerful chelator for calcium. If you saw my video on kidney stones,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=196s)** — you take lemon juice. Why? Because the citric acid binds with the calcium. So it's a super
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=203s)** — strong chelator, which means to claw and bind, okay, into the mineral calcium. And so if
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=210s)** — you're consuming this in certain amounts, you're basically eroding your teeth and you're
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=215s)** — pulling this calcium out of the teeth. And what's interesting is that the pH is not even
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=220s)** — that acid. This is like going beyond just the acid problem. And if you ever read the
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=226s)** — label on a juice bottle, guess what they add in there? Citric acid. What do they put in
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=232s)** — diet sodas? Citric acid. And of all the citrates, it's the trisodium citrate that's
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=238s)** — the worst. And it's usually labeled as sodium citrate. So citrate is citric acid. Same thing.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=246s)** — And that is the worst acid for erosion of your teeth. Normally, like your pH should be
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=253s)** — slightly neutral or alkaline, okay, which is basically just slightly above seven. If the pH
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=259s)** — gets down around 5.5 or less, that's when you start to get erosion and the loss of
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=266s)** — minerals, not just calcium, you basically get de-mineralization of your teeth. So what does
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=272s)** — this mean in practical terms? It means that if you consume anything, you should probably take
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=278s)** — some water, gargle with it and swish it in your mouth and spit it out just so you can
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=283s)** — clean your teeth of anything, whether it's sugar or citric acid. I think that would be
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=288s)** — a smart thing to do. And also other acids, I would highly recommend that you, you know,
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=292s)** — use the same process of washing your teeth out with water after you consume apple cider vinegar.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=298s)** — And of course, start reading labels to make sure you're not consuming so much
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=302s)** — citrate in these products. Now, if you're consuming like a potassium citrate or magnesium
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=307s)** — citrate, that's a different situation. That's actually bound with a mineral and you're not
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=313s)** — going to leach out your teeth. It's going to go into your digestive system and it's not
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=316s)** — going to be a problem. But anything that actually exposes the citrate to your teeth for
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=322s)** — you have to really watch out for. Now, since we're on the topic of teeth, I think it'd be
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=326s)** — a really good idea for you to have a good recipe to make your own toothpaste. And if
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafi94q8gPg&t=332s)** — you want to check that out, I put it up right here.
