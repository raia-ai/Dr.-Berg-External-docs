- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=0s)** — There are five critical warning signs that you should never ignore.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=5s)** — A lot of people have one of these five symptoms and they're normalizing them.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=10s)** — And I'm here to tell you that you don't want to ignore these five signs because
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=14s)** — you can usually do something about it if you catch it in time.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=18s)** — Far too often when you go to the doctor, they just basically treat your symptoms.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=21s)** — What's causing your blood pressure? It could be this or that. Here, just take this medication.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=24s)** — High cholesterol, take this medication. Arthritis, take this medication.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=28s)** — I am more interested in finding the underlying root cause so I don't have to take medication the
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=34s)** — rest of my life. So let's start with number one. Chronic fatigue. You could be fatigued
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=40s)** — chronically from so many things. If you have anemia, that could be either low B12 or iron.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=48s)** — I was chronically fatigued for many, many years and I was taking tons and tons of
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=54s)** — vitamins thinking that's going to help me. I'd be driving down the street with my wife and
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=58s)** — say, honey, let's go over there. They might be able to help me in this health food store.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=63s)** — I'd be asking them maybe I need this vitamin or that vitamin. I'm here to tell you that
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=67s)** — the vitamins will not work for various symptoms unless you correct the diet. There's
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=72s)** — a basic diet that I recommend that will handle a lot of problems to the point where you might
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=77s)** — not need any vitamins at all. It wasn't until I started having protein for breakfast
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=82s)** — that I really had this realization that, wow, that's the protein that I needed that just
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=87s)** — woke me up. Another cause of chronic fatigue is low vitamin B1. If you're deficient in B1,
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=94s)** — you're going to have a lot of racing of the mind thinking about problems before you go to bed,
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=99s)** — restless leg syndrome. You're going to have a lot of nervous energy. Chronic fatigue could
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=103s)** — come from a tick bite. This microorganism in these ticks, they downgrade your vitamin D
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=109s)** — receptors. Very sneaky, leaving you with the inability to use vitamin D3. If you have a
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=115s)** — liver disease, heart disease, autoimmune disease, that's involving a lot of inflammation.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=122s)** — And then let's say, for example, you've checked all these things and nothing is working.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=126s)** — There is a small rare chance that it could be something more serious, possibly cancer,
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=132s)** — probably not, but you can always get an assessment to rule that out. Number two,
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=137s)** — sudden weight loss. It could be any number of things. It could be hyperthyroidism,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=144s)** — and that can actually speed up the thyroid and cause you to lose weight. Also, type 1 diabetes
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=150s)** — can cause weight loss. A disease with your adrenal glands, where they're kind of shutting
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=155s)** — down, called Addison's disease, also could cause you to lose weight. Parasites can cause you
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=162s)** — to lose weight. Number three, persistent weakness. This could be iron. You could be
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=172s)** — a low sodium. Low sodium will cause weakness, but you can also be weak if you're low in magnesium,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=179s)** — vitamin E, and then potassium deficiency can also make you weak. Number four, chronic diarrhea.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=186s)** — Mostly, diarrhea comes from food poisoning or eating something that your body disagreed with.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=193s)** — It could also be low zinc. One of the symptoms is diarrhea. I think a common reason
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=198s)** — a lot of diarrhea is side effects from medication. So you want to look at that as well.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=203s)** — And a lot of people have irritable bowel syndrome, and they're doing a lot of grains,
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=208s)** — and the grains are just tearing up their colon or getting diarrhea from that. But I think
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=212s)** — a big one, especially if you travel overseas somewhere, getting a parasite that can create
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=218s)** — diarrhea, in which case, when you get back, you need to take a probiotic, a strong one,
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=224s)** — for a long time to fix that problem. And then number five is persistent stomach or abdomen
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=231s)** — pain. I would start eating better and then get rid of the junk food. That should handle
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=237s)** — 95% of the problem right there. If it doesn't, suspect other reasons, which could be coming
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=245s)** — from a gallstone or a kidney stone. And you won't be able to tell the difference unless they
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=250s)** — do an ultrasound or some other test. And so a kidney stone too is not always felt in the back
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=256s)** — part. It could be felt in the front as well. There's another condition called small intestinal
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=261s)** — bacterial overgrowth where the microbes are in the small intestine, not the large. The
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=265s)** — solution is to do intermittent fasting, garlic, and some betaine hydrochloride. But this is
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=271s)** — all generated from being very, very sick. With the abdomen, you could have like appendicitis.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=277s)** — You could have a parasite. I mean, it could be cancer, rare. It could be an ulcer or gallbladder
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=284s)** — sludge, which is actually more common than you think. The bile starts to thicken in the tubes
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=290s)** — and cause backup in the pancreas. It can even create inflammation in the pancreas called
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=294s)** — pancreatitis, in which case the remedy is TUDCA. That will thin the bile, give you a
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=304s)** — IQ on the area of nutrition and food and diet. And it's very ironic that I went to the
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=311s)** — exact opposite extreme, focusing most of my time now on studying this topic. If a doctor
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=318s)** — diagnoses you and says it's all in your head, ignore them and go to another doctor
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=323s)** — and realize when someone gives you a prescription or even a remedy for something like this,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=327s)** — you have to question, is this really correcting the underlying cause or is this suppressing in a
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBOrKcsVbOs&t=332s)** — symptom that will keep the problem there longer?
