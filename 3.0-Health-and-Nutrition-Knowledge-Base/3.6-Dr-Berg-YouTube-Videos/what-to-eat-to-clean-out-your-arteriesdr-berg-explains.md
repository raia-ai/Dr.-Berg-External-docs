- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=0s)** — You know, heart disease is right at the top of the list among all causes of death. And I talk a lot
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=7s)** — about what to avoid for heart problems and cardiovascular disease. But today we're going
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=11s)** — to talk about what to eat to clean out your arteries, whether you already have an existing
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=17s)** — heart problem or you want to just prevent some things. So I'm going to talk about what to eat.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=21s)** — But I think it's going to be important to also cover what not to eat. So I just want to
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=25s)** — briefly talk about that and then get right into exactly what you should eat. So that way
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=29s)** — you know why you should eat certain things. All right, so where does this heart problem actually
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=33s)** — start and originate? Well, it starts on the inside of your artery. There's a very thin
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=40s)** — layer of cells. In fact, it's just a one cell layer thickness inside your arteries. And it's
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=45s)** — called the endothelial layer. And it's permeable. It allows things to go back and
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=51s)** — forth. And it lines all your vascular system, as well as the lymphatic system. And your
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=57s)** — kidneys are connected to this. So when you filter blood to the kidneys, you have this
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=63s)** — little thin wall that helps to filter things out, as well as keep things in. And so this
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=68s)** — cell wall actually has a lot of different receptors for controlling blood pressure.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=75s)** — There's hormonal interactions. There's a huge immune part of these cells. So whatever's in
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=80s)** — your blood is going to affect that layer. I mean, the obvious thing is like when you
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=85s)** — those things as toxins end up in your blood, and it actually influences that cell wall.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=90s)** — And I do want to emphasize the word chronic, because you have people that
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=94s)** — occasionally go off their plans, right? But then you have people that chronically
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=98s)** — do certain things, right? They're chronically exposing their arteries to whatever's in the
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=102s)** — smoke or whatever's in their food or alcohol. And that really creates the big problem. And
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=107s)** — you also have as another aspect, stress can affect that cell layer. And of course,
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=113s)** — sugar, refined sugars, especially refined carbohydrates, even sometimes worse than sugar,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=120s)** — even the gluten and grains can irritate that cell wall. And another big one is seed oils,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=126s)** — okay, canola, soy oil, corn oil, cotton seed oil. So when the inside layer of your arteries
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=133s)** — are exposed to these things, you induce inflammation. And that is really the start of
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=138s)** — this cascade of things where your body starts triggering this healing response where
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=142s)** — you get this band-aid, which includes proteins like fibrous tissue called fibrin. And then you
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=148s)** — have a combination of cholesterol and calcium. So that's what makes up this clot. And there's
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=153s)** — really some good tests out there, especially the coronary artery calcification test, the CAC
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=159s)** — test, I would highly recommend to do that. I had it done. You want it zero. And that's a
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=163s)** — really good predictor of mortality. Another really good test is a heart rate variability
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=169s)** — test. There's a lot of research on that, which is a certain devices that you can hook up to
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=175s)** — even your finger or a band around your waist or your arm to pick up what's happening with the
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=180s)** — contraction and relaxation of not just the heart, but all the vessels involved. And from
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=185s)** — that test, you can tell what's happening with the cardiovascular system. It's really good,
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=190s)** — especially with long distance runners who look healthy, but some of them are not healthy.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=195s)** — They're overtraining or something, and they have inflammation going on in the arteries,
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=199s)** — which then can create a problem like a heart attack after they reach the finish line. So
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=204s)** — you can't always go by how someone looks on the outside. There's certain tests that can pick
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=209s)** — up things on the inside. Another really good test would be to measure the small dense particle
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=214s)** — size of your LDLs. That's a really good indicator of something called oxidative LDL,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=220s)** — which is basically this protein carrier of certain fat that has been exposed to certain
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=226s)** — things. And it's a bit pathogenic because it can invade inside of that layer and get deeper
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=232s)** — into the area. And it can create inflammation and it lingers around longer than the other
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=237s)** — LDL called the large buoyant, which I don't want to get too deep into that topic,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=242s)** — but you just need to know that there's two types of LDL and there's kind of one that is
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=246s)** — pathogenic and one that is not as pathogenic. You also have this other bar marker, which
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=252s)** — actually indicates a B vitamin deficiency. Okay. And that would be homocysteine. So that's
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=257s)** — another test that could be done. If homocysteine is too high, this means that you're deficient
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=263s)** — certain B vitamins that are necessary to protect the inside of the artery. And if you
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=269s)** — have high homocysteine, you can be at risk for heart attack and stroke. And for that,
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=273s)** — you're going to need natural forms of certain vitamins like folate and also B6 and also B12.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=283s)** — Because here's the thing, there is a certain genetic problem that a lot of people have,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=289s)** — and it's called MTHFR. And if you have a problem with this, this means that you can't
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=293s)** — convert these synthetic versions of these vitamins to the active form. A lot of people
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=300s)** — homocysteine level goes up and they're at risk for a lot of problems. So a simple solution is
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=306s)** — just to consume more folate, not folic acid, which is in a lot of the enriched flour products
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=313s)** — and rich grains. They also put in energy drinks and they put in supplements. You want to stay
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=318s)** — away from folic acid. And then we have this question of like, how does the calcium end up
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=321s)** — in the arteries? Well, there's one protein in the body that helps you keep calcium from
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=327s)** — building up in the soft tissues in the arteries. And that protein is controlled by vitamin K2.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=334s)** — So part of this list of foods are going to be heavy in the vitamin K2 because we want to
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=339s)** — keep the calcium out of the arteries. Another really common deficiency that creates a lot of
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=347s)** — problems in the arteries, because it's a real strong protective thing for the inside of
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=350s)** — the arteries, is vitamin E. So part of this list is also going to include vitamin E. And
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=355s)** — one food that really depletes your vitamin E is the refined grains. The problem with grains
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=361s)** — is it's loaded with gluten too. And then you say, well, what if I have gluten free? Well,
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=364s)** — then it's refined. So we have this higher sugar, this product that turns in the sugar
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=369s)** — faster. And we don't want sugar to end up in the arteries. Niacin is another really
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=374s)** — important nutrient that is going to be in these lists of foods. And of course, vitamin C
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=379s)** — is going to be in there as well, because that's a very important antioxidant that can
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=383s)** — decrease some of the damage that you're exposed to in the environment with the foods you eat
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=389s)** — and other things. So let's dive right into the list. Okay, number one is the heavy on
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=394s)** — the omega-3 fatty acids. That would be of course salmon, other fatty fish, sardines,
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=399s)** — very, very important. And there's one more thing too, that I consume on a regular basis.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=404s)** — And you probably heard of cod liver oil, but you may have not heard of cod liver. That's
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=413s)** — the cod liver in the oil. And sometimes I crave it. So I'll do this, you know, maybe once or
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=420s)** — twice a week, it has my protein source. It's bathed in this omega-3 fatty acid. So
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=426s)** — I wouldn't drink all that. I would just have the salmon and maybe feed the oil to your
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=432s)** — animals, like dogs, for example, they like it. But it's a lot of oil to consume. And
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=437s)** — sometimes I'll do sardines as well. And of course, the sardines, I do an olive oil. So
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=441s)** — that would be number two. Olive oil. Olive oil has a lot of great properties for the cardiovascular
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=447s)** — system to help people prevent the high blood pressure. It's a really good fat. It's loaded
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=452s)** — with heart healthy, supportive things for the endothelial cells. And you really want to make
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=457s)** — sure that it's extra virgin olive oil from a location or farm that really cares about their
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=462s)** — olive oil, that does a good job of producing it compared to some of the olive oil that you
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=467s)** — take. It's just so bland. It's not even real. And there's also a lot of fake olive oil out there.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=472s)** — So make sure you have the good stuff. I like the stuff from Italy, but there's also great
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=476s)** — stuff from Greece, Spain, France, all over the place. And number three, dark leafy green
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=482s)** — vegetables. Okay, so you can put the olive oil on that dark leafy green to help extract
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=488s)** — these phytonutrients, because a lot of the phytonutrients in plants, especially salad,
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=493s)** — are fat soluble. And the dark leafy green vegetables have a good amount of vitamin C.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=499s)** — Okay, they also are loaded with folate, which is the natural form of B9. And the
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=504s)** — dark leafy green vegetables also has magnesium, as well as potassium. Okay, and the next food
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=509s)** — I'm going to recommend is a type of cheese that you'll put on your salad. Now a lot of
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=513s)** — people use the American version of this called parmesan cheese, right, which is I think by
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=518s)** — craft, from my viewpoint, doesn't even compare to the real stuff that they specialize in a
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=524s)** — certain part of Italy to create this one type of cheese, which is loaded in vitamin K2,
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=530s)** — which is really important in keeping that calcium out of the artery. And please excuse
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=533s)** — me if I butcher the name of this, but it's called parmigiano. And you can usually find
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=538s)** — this at any store. You have to make sure that you get the right kind, because a lot of
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=542s)** — times the regular parmesan cheese that you get in America, they have this added ingredient
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=546s)** — called cellulose, which is from wood pulp, kind of like a filler. Like, let me ask you this,
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=551s)** — why would you want to put a filler in this cheese? I will guarantee if you get the real
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=555s)** — stuff from Italy, they're not going to put wood pulp in there, okay, in the form of
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=558s)** — cellulose. And I actually did a tour of how they make this cheese, and they put a lot of
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=563s)** — care into this traditional cheese. It's dynamite on your salad. So you get all this vitamin K2,
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=569s)** — you add the extra virgin olive oil on there. And then I also put nutritional yeast, okay.
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=575s)** — Remember when I said unfortified, right? You want to get the one that's not fortified with
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=579s)** — anything synthetic. If you fortify it with natural vitamins, fine, but not with synthetics,
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=583s)** — like most companies do. But the point is that this nutritional yeast has a good natural
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=589s)** — form of B9. And the one that I recommend, which I'll put a link down below, also has the
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=594s)** — right form of B12, which is methylcobolamine. But it gives it a natural boost of B vitamins,
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=600s)** — including B1 for stress. And it also has a nice little cheesy taste to it. I love it.
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=604s)** — So there's another food that I'm going to add to this list that's loaded with vitamin K2
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=609s)** — and loaded with vitamin C. In fact, it is the top food that I know of that has the most vitamin
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=615s)** — C of anything, and it's raw sauerkraut. So it's very important not to buy sauerkraut in
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=622s)** — a bottle that has been pasteurized. You want it raw. But sauerkraut is loaded with vitamin
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=628s)** — K2. And it's also a probiotic. It's a prebiotic. And it also has a lot of vitamin C, like 700
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=636s)** — milligrams per cup. The next heart healthy food I'm going to recommend almonds, believe it or
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=641s)** — not, are loaded with magnesium. And so is spinach, and also vitamin E. But both of those
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=646s)** — are loaded with oxalates. So if you have cheese close to the meal, okay, you'll have
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=653s)** — calcium that will bind with the oxalates and prevent that potential irritation to your kidney
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=659s)** — or even a kidney stone if someone is predisposed to it. All right, the next food I'm going to
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=664s)** — recommend is liver. That's right. And you can do beef liver. You can even do this
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=670s)** — cob liver, right? It's liver or chicken livers. Make sure they're quality. But I know you might
- **[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=676s)** — disagree with me on this point. But just think about it. If you have a high quality
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=680s)** — liver product, like a beef liver or whatever, look what you're getting. You're getting pretty much
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=686s)** — all the nutrients you can imagine. I mean, almost every vitamin that's in there in great
- **[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=690s)** — quantities. It has the folate, which is high in vegetables, and it has vitamin K2. So we're
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=696s)** — about to tell you the last one. And then I'm going to explain why I'm telling you this.
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=701s)** — Okay. First of all, if you do a search on heart healthy foods, they will give you,
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=707s)** — you know, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, right? Which we know is not very healthy from
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=714s)** — my viewpoint. And then they say stay away from, you know, sugars, junk food. And then they say
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=721s)** — red processed meat. And that is everywhere. So they're including red meat as being very
- **[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=728s)** — dangerous to your heart. And so they kind of lump in all this meat together, okay,
- **[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=732s)** — but hasn't man consumed red meat for quite some time? Haven't we evolved on red meat? I mean,
- **[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=740s)** — is that really the source of all of our heart problems? Red meat, really? And of course,
- **[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=744s)** — I'm talking about the grass fed. I'm not talking about grain fed. And I know a lot
- **[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=748s)** — of farmers in the area and a lot of them use grains too fat in the cattle, because it
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=754s)** — makes the meat marbleized. And the same thing with pigs and even horses, right? You could
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=758s)** — grain too much to a horse or a pig, they get fat. I mean, what about humans? Why would we want to
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=764s)** — recommend like 65% of our carbohydrates being grain? Why do we want to make that push? If
- **[12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=769s)** — you consume grass fed grass finished beef, it's leaner, and it's healthier. And I raise my
- **[12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=775s)** — own beef, and it's extremely healthy for the heart. It has all of the B vitamins I
- **[13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=780s)** — talked about, including folate and B6 and B12. It has iron, people aren't going to be
- **[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=786s)** — allergic to it. It's not going to irritate your gut. It's loaded with glutamine, which is good
- **[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=790s)** — for inflammation. So I just want to talk a little bit more about this red meat because
- **[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=794s)** — there's been an extensive, extensive, very large credible study that was done fairly recently
- **[13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=801s)** — that I'm going to share with you. And I actually found it in an article from Time Magazine
- **[13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=805s)** — titled, Eat less red meat. Scientists said, now some believe that was bad advice. So check
- **[13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=812s)** — this out. It says the evidence is too weak to justify telling individuals to eat less beef and
- **[13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=817s)** — pork, according to the new research. The findings erode public trust, critics said,
- **[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=822s)** — which I'm going to get to why they're saying that. If there are health benefits from eating
- **[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=827s)** — less beef and pork, they're small. The researchers concluded. Indeed, the advantages
- **[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=832s)** — are so faint that they can be discerned only when looking at large populations,
- **[13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=837s)** — the scientists said, and are not sufficient to tell individuals to change their meat eating
- **[14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=842s)** — habits. I mean, that's incredible because, I mean, look what they're trying to push with
- **[14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=846s)** — this red meat. They're trying to get rid of the cows, you know, mainly for environmental
- **[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=849s)** — thing, but they throw in there that it's bad for your health, which is absolutely based on
- **[14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=856s)** — no real evidence. Already they have been met with fierce criticism by public health
- **[14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=861s)** — researchers, the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, and Harvard Chan
- **[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=869s)** — School of Public Health and other groups. Some called for the journals editors to
- **[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=874s)** — delay publication altogether. In a statement, scientists at Harvard warned that the
- **[14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=879s)** — conclusions harm the credibility of nutrition science and erode public trust in scientific
- **[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=886s)** — Let me just ask you a question. If we find something based on science that is more true,
- **[14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=895s)** — that's kind of a new piece of knowledge, what you think that's because it's conflicting
- **[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=901s)** — with what we've been told before, that's going to erode trust, it's going to basically
- **[15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=904s)** — increase trust. And who's telling us that? What should we just ignore this new finding
- **[15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=909s)** — because, you know, we don't want to confuse the public. I mean, for me, I want to know
- **[15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=914s)** — That's what builds trust. Hiding it from the public or telling a different narrative
- **[15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=918s)** — creates more distrust. I mean, it's so funny. It harms the credibility of nutritional science.
- **[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=924s)** — Well, if nutritional science was based on good studies, then they wouldn't be harmed because
- **[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=928s)** — they would be telling the truth. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a group
- **[15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=933s)** — advocating a plant-based diet, on Wednesday filed a petition against the journal with the
- **[15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=938s)** — Trade Commission. Wow. So you're going to attack a research paper based on your disagreement. Now
- **[15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=945s)** — you're going to start involving the Federal Trade Commission? Like this is like, ridiculous. This
- **[15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=949s)** — is not science. In science, we want to welcome opposing viewpoints. We don't want to science
- **[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=955s)** — the other side, the competition, basically. This is what they said in the study. It says,
- **[15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=959s)** — the World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer has indicated that
- **[16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=964s)** — red meat is probably carcinogenic to humans, whereas processed meat is considered carcinogenic
- **[16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=971s)** — to humans. These recommendations are, however, primarily based on observational studies
- **[16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=976s)** — that are at high risk for confounding and thus are limited in establishing
- **[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=983s)** — causal inferences. Nor did they report the absolute magnitude of any possible effects.
- **[16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=989s)** — Furthermore, the organizations that produce guidelines did not conduct or assess rigorous
- **[16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=995s)** — systematic reviews of the evidence, were also limited in addressing conflicts of interests,
- **[16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1001s)** — and did not explicitly address population values and preferences, raising questions regarding the
- **[16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1008s)** — adherence to guideline standards for trustworthiness. So in other words, this
- **[16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1014s)** — red meat is a probable cancer is based on information that has conflict of interest,
- **[17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1022s)** — which I've already been through that research and I'll share more of that
- **[17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1026s)** — down below with some links. So check this out. Our analysis has several strengths. We
- **[17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1032s)** — conducted five separate rigorous systematic reviews addressing both the evidence and
- **[17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1037s)** — randomized trials and observational studies regarding the impact of unprocessed red meat
- **[17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1043s)** — and processed meat on cardiovascular and cancer outcomes and community values and preferences
- **[17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1049s)** — regarding red meat and processed meat consumption. Despite our findings from our assessment of
- **[17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1054s)** — intake studies versus dietary pattern studies, their conclusion is that unprocessed red meat
- **[17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1061s)** — and processed meat are unlikely, the causal factor for adverse health outcomes. I wanted
- **[17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1069s)** — to bring it up because one of the things that the tobacco industry used to do or started to do,
- **[17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1074s)** — which then the ultra-processed food companies are doing, is putting doubt into your mind about
- **[18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1081s)** — what is good and what is bad to keep everyone confused. And one definite thing about red meat
- **[18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1086s)** — is to put doubts in your mind that that could be bad for you. And so here you are avoiding
- **[18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1090s)** — it when really it's not based on sound science at all. Just going forward, I'm going to
- **[18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1099s)** — add PR on how unhealthy red meat is. I mean, it's really important to look at the source of
- **[18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1104s)** — this data that's being pushed out there. Who's pushing it out there and who's really
- **[18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1107s)** — going to benefit from people not eating beef. But red meat when it's high quality is very good
- **[18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1113s)** — for the heart, especially if you're not consuming with it these grains and sugars and
- **[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1118s)** — junk food. Now, if you enjoyed this video, there's another video talking about the best meal
- **[18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1125s)** — for your arteries to keep your arteries really clean. If you haven't seen that video,
- **[18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-K2kwojNXw&t=1129s)** — which is very popular, I'll put that up right here. Check it out.
