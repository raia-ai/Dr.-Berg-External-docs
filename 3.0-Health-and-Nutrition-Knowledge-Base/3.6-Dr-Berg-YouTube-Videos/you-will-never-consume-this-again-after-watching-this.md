- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=0s)** — One French fry equals the toxicity of one cigarette.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=3s)** — Doctors do learn what dietitians learn, but you know, that's very limited.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=7s)** — What we do learn is most of it is not true.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=10s)** — Never before in history, to my knowledge, had an entire organization
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=14s)** — done the deal with the devil, which they did.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=17s)** — Kids born in the year 2000 were going to live to be 120.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=21s)** — And I was like, that's not what I'm seeing.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=25s)** — I'm seeing a health catastrophe unfold.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=28s)** — So today I invited Dr. Kate Shanahan to talk about an important topic, seed oils.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=36s)** — So welcome, Dr. Kate. I really appreciate you being on here.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=40s)** — Thank you so much, Eric, because this is such an important topic.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=43s)** — And I am so delighted to be able to speak about this with you.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=48s)** — Yeah, and the reason I wanted to bring you on is because you're
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=51s)** — you're basically the first person to really bring this kind of mainstream,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=55s)** — this really important point on some of the dangers of seed oils.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=60s)** — But I just want to just very quickly give us a little summary on
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=64s)** — you graduated in 1994, right?
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=67s)** — Yes, from medical school. Yes, medical school.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=70s)** — So in school, I'm sure they don't probably give you a lot of information
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=74s)** — on nutrition or even food therapy. Right. Am I correct?
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=77s)** — We had a nutrition course. We learn what dieticians learn.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=81s)** — Doctors do learn what dieticians learn.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=83s)** — But that's very limited.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=85s)** — What we do learn is most of it is not true.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=87s)** — So I'm sure you've had people discussing before.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=89s)** — Salt doesn't cause hypertension.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=91s)** — Fat doesn't make you fat.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=93s)** — Sugar is not the ideal fuel for ourselves.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=96s)** — So, you know, most of what we learn about nutrition is actually
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=100s)** — misinformation. And so it's dangerous.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=103s)** — And so doctors are actually dangerous when if you're trusting
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=107s)** — your doctor's nutrition advice, you're going to end up sick.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=111s)** — Yeah, even if they bring up the topic, because I don't even remember
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=114s)** — any doctor that I've ever been to ask me, OK, so the first question
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=119s)** — is, what have you been eating?
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=120s)** — Yeah, they'll bring it up.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=121s)** — You know, if your cholesterol is high, which isn't actually a problem,
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=124s)** — that is a problem they've invented.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=126s)** — Like, they'll bring it up under limited circumstances.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=128s)** — But the medical doctrine is not to look for real root causes.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=134s)** — And so, like, that's what really lights a fire under my parts
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=139s)** — about like getting getting the word out here, because if we could get
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=143s)** — to the root cause, we can fix everything.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=146s)** — And I've seen it happen, you know, hundreds of times personally
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=150s)** — and thousands of testimonials now, as I'm sure you have,
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=153s)** — since you give similar advice.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=155s)** — But the degree of, you know, how powerful it is and just how
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=161s)** — how much we can prevent is just so exciting.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=166s)** — And it's so simple if you boil it down the way that I do in my latest book,
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=170s)** — Dark Calories.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=172s)** — You know, I got I got your book and it just is I love the title of the book,
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=176s)** — Dark Calories, because I just pulled me right.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=178s)** — I'm like, oh, what's that all about? Right.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=180s)** — So I have a series of questions I want to ask you.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=183s)** — And I want to dissect this topic starting from how can you possibly take
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=188s)** — seed oils, which is very unstable.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=190s)** — What do they do to preserve it?
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=191s)** — So the oil actually is problematic because they initiate the formation of toxins
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=201s)** — and that there is no preservation.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=204s)** — What's happening is invisible toxicity is developing in the bottle.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=210s)** — Most of us can't even detect what would be a signal that these oils are no good,
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=216s)** — which is called rancidity, which is different from oxidation.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=222s)** — It's not. So these oils are not necessarily are they rancid or are they oxidized?
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=229s)** — They are both.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=230s)** — And it depends on the time frame you're talking about.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=233s)** — So the oils that are bad are all seed oils that have these unstable fatty acids,
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=239s)** — as you mentioned, but they have also been refined, bleached and deodorized.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=246s)** — And all of the stabilizing factors that were in the seed that makes the seeds
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=252s)** — actually even nutritious in some cases, those are stripped away as part of the refining.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=259s)** — The reason that there's no rancidity actually is part of the refining, too.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=262s)** — That's a necessary part of the refining.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=267s)** — And it's actually the free fatty acids that make it rancid.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=272s)** — So things like olive oil can also go rancid, right?
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=276s)** — But they take a longer time because they've got the stabilizing factors
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=280s)** — and they've got the better fatty acids.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=282s)** — But it's just the problem with these oils is the lack of any nutritional value
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=287s)** — pretty much whatsoever. There's very few.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=289s)** — In nature, you have these seeds that have protective factors.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=292s)** — So we're removing all that stuff. And in the industrial process,
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=298s)** — what are some of the stages that you go through?
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=299s)** — You mentioned bleaching and things, but what do they actually do
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=302s)** — to turn the seed into this oil?
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=305s)** — Well, the first thing they do is they create a crude oil
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=307s)** — using a lot of heat and pressure that extracts the oil.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=312s)** — And this process can be done with what they call cold pressing.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=317s)** — Once it's kickstarted, you cannot stop it.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=321s)** — So these toxins will continue to develop and multiply and even change.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=328s)** — Like some toxins that are there at day two after refining
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=333s)** — are gone by day 14.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=336s)** — And then when you cook with them, you get more toxins.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=340s)** — When you reheat it, you get more toxins.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=343s)** — So by the time you've made the, say, a French fry,
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=346s)** — which is cooked, you know, regular French fry from a fast food joint,
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=349s)** — continuously heated for a few days or weeks,
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=353s)** — the average French fry contains as much as smoking a cigarette.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=358s)** — One French fry equals the toxicity of one cigarette.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=362s)** — What? Oh my gosh, that's crazy.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=365s)** — So that's how they multiply.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=366s)** — I mean, so this multiplication problem is real.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=369s)** — Could we relate this to free radical exposure or not?
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=374s)** — Is this just a different type of toxicity?
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=377s)** — Free radicals are definitely involved.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=379s)** — They're involved in the process of creating the toxins
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=382s)** — because oxidation and, you know, free radicals are kind of slightly different,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=386s)** — but very similar in that they destroy our cellular membranes.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=391s)** — They destroy our cellular health, both of them, oxidation and free radicals.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=394s)** — Once if you have oxidation, you're going to get free radicals.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=397s)** — If you have free radicals, you're going to get oxidation.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=400s)** — So when we're consuming this seed oil,
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=404s)** — what is it actually doing to our membranes?
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=407s)** — The toxins that form in the bottle, that form when we cook with seed oils,
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=412s)** — that form in our foods when we cook with seed oils,
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=415s)** — those toxins have the capacity to damage our cells.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=420s)** — And it just will not function because these oxidation reactions
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=425s)** — are the very thing that triggers the inflammatory response system.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=430s)** — You see this on your skin, right? With sunburn, actually,
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=433s)** — is the simplest form of visible membrane oxidation damage.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=440s)** — And it happens worse when you have a high seed oil diet
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=443s)** — because a little bit of toxicity, a little bit of oxidation reaction
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=450s)** — becomes unstoppable on a high seed oil diet because of how it affects us.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=456s)** — There's so many other consequences that, you know,
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=459s)** — I have to write separate chapters about each of these.
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=462s)** — It's just unbelievable.
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=465s)** — But the good news is that means it's the most powerful lever
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=468s)** — by which you can improve your health.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=472s)** — And none of this is something that I learned in medical school.
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=475s)** — Let me go without saying.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=478s)** — Right. This is all stuff I had to figure out because
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=481s)** — I wanted to be able to help my patients,
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=485s)** — really, truly help them.
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=486s)** — And I didn't feel like drugs were doing much.
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=489s)** — What initially got you to...
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=491s)** — start looking outside the box?
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=494s)** — Was there something that occurred?
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=496s)** — I met a family, a four generation Hawaii family,
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=500s)** — and the grandmother was...
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=502s)** — actually, this is the great grandmother who had brought in her great grandson.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=506s)** — And she was in her 80s.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=508s)** — And in stellar health, her chart was about five pages thick,
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=513s)** — coming in for, you know, cutness shots and stitches.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=516s)** — And her great grandson was just 10.
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=520s)** — But he was on three daily medications, had thick bottle,
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=523s)** — you know, bottleneck glasses, braces,
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=526s)** — lots of chronic allergies, chronic learning disorder problems.
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=530s)** — The dominant narrative was we had just spent the 20th century
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=534s)** — expanding our longevity.
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=536s)** — You know, at the beginning, it was like 40 years.
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=538s)** — By the end, it was 77 on average.
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=541s)** — They were predicting that kids born in the year 2000
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=545s)** — were going to live to be 120.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=547s)** — And I was like, that's not what I'm seeing.
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=551s)** — I'm seeing a health catastrophe unfold right before my eyes.
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=556s)** — I'm a family practice doctor.
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=558s)** — So that's why I was caring for all these different generations.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=562s)** — And I knew the family intimately.
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=564s)** — And I was like, this is...
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=566s)** — I had just met the great grandson.
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=568s)** — And that was the tipping point, because I'm like, this is wrong.
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=572s)** — And I've got to get to the bottom of this.
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=574s)** — And I also had my own health problems,
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=576s)** — my own health challenges that had kind of just spurred me
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=579s)** — to start looking into nutrition as well.
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=582s)** — And so I felt like I needed to get to the truth
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=585s)** — because the narrative was saturated fat was the problem.
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=589s)** — And so I was like, OK, so what is doing this to us?
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=592s)** — Is it just the deprivation of nutrients
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=596s)** — like Weston Price talked about?
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=597s)** — Or is there something else going on?
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=600s)** — And two halves of my life came together
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=602s)** — because before I went to medical school, I was a biochemist.
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=605s)** — I went to Cornell for biochemistry to get a PhD
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=610s)** — and being able to modify bacteria to digest plastic.
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=614s)** — And as soon as I found out about these oils that were everywhere
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=618s)** — and I hadn't been paying attention,
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=620s)** — I was like, this is so important.
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=623s)** — And I just dove into trying to figure out the connections.
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=627s)** — And really, there wasn't any...
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=629s)** — I couldn't just read something that existed.
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=631s)** — I had to use the understanding of biochemistry that I had gained
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=637s)** — before going to medical school
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=639s)** — and then kind of push that into what I learned about medicine
- **[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=643s)** — to create basically a whole new way of thinking about the root cause of disease.
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=648s)** — And that's what I've been writing about for like 14, 15 years now.
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=653s)** — Wow. You know, on top of this heart-healthy seed oil,
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=659s)** — so you're thinking, oh, yeah, it's fine.
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=660s)** — You know, that's just been ingrained in our minds.
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=663s)** — How can they claim that?
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=664s)** — The doctors don't know that the data that supports that claim
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=671s)** — was bought and sold by Procter & Gamble,
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=674s)** — who funded the American Heart Association,
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=678s)** — the entire organization.
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=682s)** — There have been doctors who, like individual doctors throughout history,
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=686s)** — who were willing to, you know, take money and say whatever.
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=689s)** — Say cigarettes are healthy. You know, that happened repeatedly.
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=692s)** — But never before in history, to my knowledge,
- **[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=695s)** — had an entire organization done the deal with the devil, which they did.
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=700s)** — The person who stepped up to basically defend seed oils is Ancel Keys.
- **[11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=706s)** — And Ancel Keys had this big idea that saturated fat clogged our arteries,
- **[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=711s)** — but polyunsaturates being liquid wouldn't.
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=714s)** — I mean, really, it was really that simplistic and frankly stupid idea.
- **[11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=719s)** — That's not how the body works.
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=720s)** — He wasn't a medical doctor, but he went around the world
- **[12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=724s)** — with all this money that Procter & Gamble gave him,
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=727s)** — creating just reams and reams of paperwork that passes for evidence.
- **[12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=735s)** — Because nobody reads it.
- **[12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=736s)** — Like when I look at it and when I read it myself, I was like,
- **[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=740s)** — I can't believe this stuff is ever got published.
- **[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=743s)** — It's basically random musings and rantings.
- **[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=748s)** — There's nothing systematic about it.
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=750s)** — And it contradicts itself because there's other authors who disagree
- **[12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=753s)** — with Keys because he was kind of a jerk.
- **[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=756s)** — And he was trying to gaslight everybody that was working with him
- **[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=760s)** — and to going along with his theory,
- **[12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=762s)** — but the evidence wasn't showing his theory was right.
- **[12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=765s)** — Wasn't there another book called The Prudent Diet that was pushed at that time?
- **[12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=770s)** — The American Heart Association got behind this other doctor
- **[12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=775s)** — who was promoting his diet book, which was full of seed oils and margarine,
- **[13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=781s)** — because he saw the trend coming.
- **[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=785s)** — They were interconnected buddies.
- **[13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=787s)** — And he was like, OK, great. So this is the trend.
- **[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=789s)** — So let's jump on this trend.
- **[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=790s)** — I'm going to write a book that basically the American Heart Association
- **[13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=796s)** — supported. There was mutual interests.
- **[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=798s)** — They supported each other.
- **[13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=800s)** — And it became wildly popular to avoid saturated fats thanks to that book,
- **[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=807s)** — which, again, no evidence, no evidence.
- **[13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=811s)** — But it was so promoted and popular that it radically changed
- **[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=819s)** — what Americans ate forever.
- **[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=822s)** — This is going to go down in history.
- **[13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=825s)** — Unfortunately, I don't know when there's going to be class action.
- **[13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=828s)** — So, you know, like trans fats have been around for like 100 years.
- **[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=832s)** — And they finally say, OK, now it's bad after 90 years.
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=835s)** — My goal is just on a grassroots level to get people to be aware of this
- **[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=840s)** — and start to avoid it and do the alternative things.
- **[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=845s)** — But what about the relationship between seed oils and insulin resistance?
- **[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=849s)** — Is there a connection there?
- **[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=851s)** — This is so important.
- **[14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=853s)** — And this is what I call my energy model of insulin resistance,
- **[14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=859s)** — because insulin resistance is nearly ubiquitous in this country.
- **[14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=864s)** — Something close to 99 percent of the population was found to be insulin
- **[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=869s)** — resistant on a large survey done and done in the year 2006.
- **[14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=878s)** — And it's probably worse, but nobody knows what the root cause of insulin resistance is.
- **[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=886s)** — And people are talking about it being carbohydrates.
- **[14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=888s)** — And I would say that that's not what the science suggests.
- **[14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=892s)** — It boils down to the fact that your body fat, when you've been filling it up
- **[14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=896s)** — with the polyunsaturates from seed oils, does not give your mitochondria
- **[15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=902s)** — the fuel that they need. And it can actually hurt your mitochondria.
- **[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=906s)** — I just want to just pause there because this is very interesting.
- **[15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=910s)** — We consume fats, we consume carbs that turn into fats, but seed oils,
- **[15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=916s)** — I just... people assume, well, they're just burned up as energy, right?
- **[15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=920s)** — Just burned up just like any other fuel.
- **[15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=922s)** — But that's not true.
- **[15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=923s)** — That's not true.
- **[15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=925s)** — Wow. Wow. So they get stored somewhere in the fat cell or something,
- **[15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=931s)** — and they just... our bodies can't use it effectively?
- **[15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=934s)** — They get stored in the fat cells. That's exactly right.
- **[15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=937s)** — And they... because of the amount that the average person is eating now,
- **[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=941s)** — where 80% of their fat calories are coming from seed oils...
- **[15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=945s)** — What percentage?
- **[15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=946s)** — 80% of our fat calories are coming from seed oils.
- **[15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=949s)** — Now, it's not all polyunsaturates.
- **[15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=950s)** — It doesn't mean our body fat is that many polyunsaturates,
- **[15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=953s)** — but it has way more, right?
- **[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=955s)** — It has normally historically somewhere around 5%, maybe less.
- **[15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=959s)** — Some people say more, but somewhere around 5% historically.
- **[16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=963s)** — And now people have something like 20%, 30%, 40%.
- **[16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=968s)** — We've changed the chemistry of the largest organ in our body,
- **[16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=974s)** — our adipose fat tissue.
- **[16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=976s)** — And it's making us crave foods that will raise our sugar
- **[16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=982s)** — because that's an alternative fuel, right?
- **[16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=985s)** — So just our cells are like, well, fat's not working for us.
- **[16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=988s)** — They don't know from polyunsaturate or whatever,
- **[16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=991s)** — but they do know another fuel is glucose,
- **[16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=996s)** — always in our bloodstream.
- **[16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=998s)** — And that's the key to understanding this connection
- **[16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1002s)** — between seed oils and obesity
- **[16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1005s)** — and seed oils and insulin resistance
- **[16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1008s)** — and seed oils and all metabolic diseases.
- **[16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1012s)** — Wow.
- **[16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1012s)** — Right? That's the key.
- **[16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1014s)** — You know, I'm developing an app to pick up and scan
- **[16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1017s)** — and be able to identify seed oils and foods
- **[16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1019s)** — because it's in mayonnaise, it's in dressings,
- **[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1023s)** — it's in pretty much all the restaurants.
- **[17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1025s)** — You can't find a restaurant without them cooking something
- **[17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1028s)** — in seed oil.
- **[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1029s)** — Yes. So that's why in the back of Dark Calories,
- **[17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1032s)** — I give people a script to say to different restaurants
- **[17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1037s)** — in different settings, like I help you navigate this
- **[17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1040s)** — because it is a minefield.
- **[17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1042s)** — The entire world wants to shove these oils
- **[17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1045s)** — down your throat.
- **[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1046s)** — They don't care.
- **[17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1047s)** — It's cheap.
- **[17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1048s)** — There's all these excuses they use,
- **[17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1050s)** — high smoke point neutral, nobody's allergic to it,
- **[17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1053s)** — like peanut oil, for example.
- **[17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1055s)** — And, you know, so it's everywhere
- **[17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1057s)** — and you have to have your defenses ready.
- **[17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1062s)** — So that's what the last third of the book,
- **[17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1065s)** — Dark Calories, does is it gives you the defenses
- **[17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1069s)** — you need to protect your health and your family's health,
- **[17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1073s)** — your children's health, everybody you care about.
- **[17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1076s)** — If a person is trying to figure out
- **[17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1078s)** — what to replace it with, can you give us some ideas
- **[18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1080s)** — and what are some safe oils that we could cook with?
- **[18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1083s)** — Yeah, so I have my favorite five,
- **[18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1086s)** — but there's a list of delightful dozen in the book.
- **[18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1089s)** — So my favorite five are olive oil, butter,
- **[18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1093s)** — coconut oil, peanut oil, and sesame oil.
- **[18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1096s)** — There's so many choices and these things are delicious.
- **[18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1099s)** — Right? It makes your food taste better.
- **[18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1101s)** — Because the other thing about these deodorized oils
- **[18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1104s)** — and being refined is they have no flavor agents in them.
- **[18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1110s)** — And what they do, since they're so slippery and wiggly,
- **[18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1114s)** — these palli and saturates that are flexible,
- **[18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1117s)** — breakable molecules, they totally coat your taste buds.
- **[18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1123s)** — So they actually kind of can make it harder
- **[18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1125s)** — for you to taste other things.
- **[18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1128s)** — Wow, I didn't know that.
- **[18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1130s)** — If someone stops consuming seed oils,
- **[18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1132s)** — how long does it take to get it out
- **[18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1135s)** — of your fat cell or your body?
- **[18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1137s)** — Is it possible over time?
- **[18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1139s)** — It is absolutely possible.
- **[19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1142s)** — And it takes a while because we're talking about,
- **[19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1147s)** — exchanging pounds of molecules, right?
- **[19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1151s)** — So the estimates are somewhere around a year and a half.
- **[19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1154s)** — A lot of people do focus on,
- **[19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1156s)** — oh my God, I don't want these things in my body
- **[19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1158s)** — and I have to wait a year and a half.
- **[19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1161s)** — That makes people feel panicky and they want to try
- **[19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1165s)** — all kinds of unproven detox methods and stuff like that.
- **[19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1170s)** — You don't need to because you are going to be able
- **[19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1174s)** — to help your mitochondria to improve your energy
- **[19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1177s)** — and all the good things, reverse insulin resistance.
- **[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1180s)** — Starting from day one,
- **[19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1181s)** — you start to improve your mitochondrial function
- **[19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1186s)** — because the foods that I recommend in dark calories
- **[19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1191s)** — give your mitochondria energy.
- **[19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1193s)** — They help you get energy.
- **[19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1195s)** — And the other thing that they do is they help support
- **[19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1198s)** — your body's antioxidant system,
- **[20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1201s)** — which is so, so important so that your mitochondria
- **[20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1205s)** — aren't quite so susceptible to shutting down
- **[20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1210s)** — from burning a little bit of PUFA,
- **[20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1212s)** — a little bit of the polyacetrate fatty acids, right?
- **[20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1214s)** — And so we really need to eat a diet that helps our body
- **[20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1219s)** — create our own antioxidant enzymes from scratch.
- **[20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1224s)** — It's enzymes that we need,
- **[20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1226s)** — which are biological machines made out of protein.
- **[20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1229s)** — And they use vitamins, they use minerals
- **[20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1232s)** — to do their machine work of capturing the free radicals
- **[20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1238s)** — and literally catching the bad oxygen molecules.
- **[20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1244s)** — They break these free radical chain reactions.
- **[20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1247s)** — They block the oxidation,
- **[20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1248s)** — but it's enzymes that we need and they come from protein.
- **[20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1252s)** — And a lot of folks, a lot of women,
- **[20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1254s)** — especially menopausal women, I've found don't get anywhere
- **[20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1258s)** — near enough protein in their diet.
- **[21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1261s)** — Right, that's really important.
- **[21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1264s)** — So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put your link
- **[21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1267s)** — in the description and I highly recommend everyone
- **[21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1269s)** — read that book because it's called Dark Calories.
- **[21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1272s)** — Amazing, you won't be able to put it down.
- **[21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1274s)** — It's just filled with gold information
- **[21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1276s)** — that wish we would have got like 30 years ago,
- **[21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1279s)** — when I was started getting interested in nutrition.
- **[21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1282s)** — So I just appreciate you spending the time
- **[21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1284s)** — giving us this data and I'll have to have you back
- **[21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1287s)** — on real soon, but thank you so much.
- **[21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1291s)** — I appreciate your expertise, thank you.
- **[21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKJvrUIAw0&t=1293s)** — Absolutely.
