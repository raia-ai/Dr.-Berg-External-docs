- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=0s)** — Okay, welcome back. We are going to talk first about the gallbladder. It is a little sack underneath the rib cage on the right side.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=6s)** — It actually stores something called bile. And it concentrates bile. And then when you eat fats, it squeezes out the bile and it helps you dissolve the fat
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=15s)** — in extracting vitamin A, D, E, and K. These are vitamins called fat soluble vitamins. Vitamin A is for the eyes and the skin. Vitamin D is for the bones.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=26s)** — Vitamin E is for the hormones. Vitamin K is for clotting. And also vitamin K2 is for removing calcium out of the arteries in the joints.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=35s)** — So these are really, really important. So here you are having all sorts of vitamin A deficiencies, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K deficiencies.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=42s)** — Well, it could be that you just don't have a gallbladder or enough bile like your gallbladder is congested. So that alone could cause these deficiencies.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=53s)** — Especially if you are taking these vitamins and noticing symptoms. So let's just say, for example, you have macular degeneration, okay?
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=61s)** — Yet you're consuming kale with all these amazing fat soluble vitamin vital nutrients. And it's not actually fixing the macula.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=72s)** — Or let's say you're consuming vitamin A and your vision, you still can't see it at night. Okay? But you're taking this.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=79s)** — So you're taking this. It could be that you just don't have enough bile. So you could take bile salts, purified bile salts.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=87s)** — It's in something called gallbladder formula. And you take that at the same time of consuming vitamin A or D or E or K.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=97s)** — So you're taking the bile salts with this vitamin. It drives in like a rocket ship. It just goes right into the body.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=103s)** — So anytime you want to enhance a vitamin, especially a fat soluble vitamin, and you take bile salts, you can do it very easily.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=113s)** — So some people have these skin issues where it's a classic vitamin A deficiency, yet vitamin A isn't enough because they need a little booster.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=122s)** — So this actually just helps drive in that nutrient into the cell. So if I developed something called macular degeneration,
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=128s)** — I would not just consume the kale with high levels of lutein, which actually help the macula, but I would add some bile salt at the same time
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=137s)** — and really drive that right into the eye so I can actually start to improve that situation.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=143s)** — So stomach acids are really important in the absorption of minerals, trace minerals, and proteins.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=150s)** — So if you're deficient in any of the trace minerals and minerals that you're taking them, you're not seeing any difference,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=156s)** — well, start adding some alpacite vinegar, add some betaine hydrochloride. Those are two things that acidify the stomach,
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=164s)** — and it can really help you absorb these minerals, especially if you're trying to fix your weak nails, hair loss, that type of thing.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=173s)** — But minerals have a lot of different functions that go from building proteins, to also metabolism, to energy, to hydration,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=182s)** — and making sure that your heart is in rhythm, many, many different things, okay?
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=186s)** — And then we have insulin resistance. This is a pre-diabetic situation. When you have insulin resistance, you can't absorb certain minerals and vitamins.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=195s)** — You can't absorb potassium, for example, magnesium, vitamin D. It's hard to absorb B vitamins.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=203s)** — So here you are, here consuming everything, you're taking your vitamins, but it's not working because you're pre-diabetic or you're diabetic.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=211s)** — That's why. So you have to fix this right here to start absorbing it.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=216s)** — What's really interesting is that once you start taking more of these vitamins that can't go in, like potassium, magnesium, vitamin D, B vitamins,
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=226s)** — well guess what? That actually improves insulin resistance. And then improving insulin resistance helps the absorption of those nutrients.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=234s)** — So that's the saving grace with that. And then we have low-friendly bacteria in the gut.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=239s)** — If your gut doesn't have enough of the right bacteria, you'll start showing deficiencies of B vitamins.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=245s)** — So it shows up in the skin as rashes, psoriasis, itching, all sorts of skin issues.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=252s)** — So you want to start to consume things with a lot of probiotics. One of the best things, which is even better than a lot of probiotics, is sauerkraut.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=261s)** — Sauerkraut is like consuming 10 times the amount of probiotics.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=266s)** — So if you have like a cupful a day and just consume that, you'll actually get enough of the good bacteria that you need.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9llWp0ixs&t=273s)** — So in this last video, I'm going to show you a summary of everything. I'll see you then.
