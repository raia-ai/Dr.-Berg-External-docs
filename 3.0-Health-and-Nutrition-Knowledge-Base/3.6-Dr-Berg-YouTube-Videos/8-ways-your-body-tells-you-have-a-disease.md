- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=0s)** — Anytime you understand warning signs to predict what's going to happen to your body
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=4s)** — before it happens is a very valuable thing. There's a great book, one of my favorite books,
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=10s)** — called The Technology of War. It's by Sun Tzu. Having advanced knowledge so you can predict
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=16s)** — things. Now this book, they're talking about advanced knowledge of an enemy coming so you
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=20s)** — have knowledge about if you want to go to battle with them or not. But what I like
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=24s)** — to apply this to is your body. Having advanced knowledge of what's going on and reading
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=29s)** — different indicators of your body is so important. The problem in health care is when you go to the
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=34s)** — doctor and you have these clues or symptoms, whatever, they treat them directly. They don't
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=40s)** — use them to understand what's going on. But what if you were to use these indicators
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=45s)** — differently to help understand what the body really needs? So I'm going to go through
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=51s)** — eight diseases and give you some of the warning signs that your body is trying to
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=57s)** — There's a problem so you can do something and prevent this problem from occurring. So let's
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=62s)** — start with the first one, heart attack or cardiovascular disease. So the warning signs
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=67s)** — for that are usually chest pain, pain in your left jaw, pain in your left shoulder,
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=74s)** — or pain that goes down the left arm. Or maybe when you climb stairs or go anything up an
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=80s)** — incline, you don't feel right. Something feels off, whether it's you feel out of breath,
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=85s)** — dizzy. This could be the beginning of a heart attack and one really good test to get is called
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=91s)** — the CAC test. This is a relatively quick test that can measure the calcification
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=96s)** — inside your arteries, which is a really good predictor of whether you're going to have
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=102s)** — heart attack or not. One of the best things to take as a natural remedy is vitamin E in
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=110s)** — of tokatrinols. Another good remedy is vitamin K2 because that helps remove calcium in the
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=116s)** — arteries and of course radically change your diet. Alright, number two, stroke. Some of the early
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=122s)** — warning signs of a stroke or that you're getting a stroke could be anything on one side of your
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=128s)** — body being a problem. Let's say you smile and the left side of your face just doesn't
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=133s)** — quite move or you raise both of your arms up and one arm doesn't go up. Those are classic
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=138s)** — examples that you could be having a stroke. Another one is your speech is slurred. So when
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=145s)** — you have a stroke there's always this short period of time where you can do something about
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=150s)** — it quickly and they can give you a certain medication that thins the blood to get rid of
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=155s)** — the clotting because the problem with a stroke is a lack of oxygen in a certain part of
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=161s)** — your brain. It's called epoxy. And the longer that your brain goes without oxygen the more
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=166s)** — that can occur. So the best thing to do is to go to the emergency room and get that checked out.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=171s)** — Alright, number three, an infection. Some of the early warning signs would be like a little
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=175s)** — tickle in your throat, this irritating cough that won't go away, or maybe it's your
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=180s)** — excessively sneezing or you might have a runny nose. All of these can be indicators that
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=185s)** — your body is coming down with something. The most important thing to do would be to take
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=190s)** — vitamin D3 in large amounts. I'm talking about 50,000 IUs. Adding some zinc and vitamin C would
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=197s)** — also be helpful. If you have any echinacea around that's another good one. And then also just
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=202s)** — to stay really hot and warm to the point where you're sweating so if you can generate
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=209s)** — a fever that can actually quickly kill it off. Versus what a lot of people do is they'll
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=213s)** — take some medication to suppress the fever which is the very thing that's going to help
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=219s)** — overcome the virus. In fact, when people take aspirin to cut the fever down,
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=225s)** — now the duration of the infection is longer. All right, number four, fatty liver disease.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=230s)** — One of the warning signs for that would be like a full feeling or maybe even a tender or
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=236s)** — tightness underneath the right rib cage. That sometimes refers to the right shoulder, this
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=243s)** — muscle right here. Or it could even go back into the rhomboid. All of that is more
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=250s)** — liver, gallbladder, kind of swollen. Could be a fatty liver. But one of the big indications
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=254s)** — of a fatty liver is that your stomach is protruding. You have belly fat. The extra is
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=259s)** — spilling off into and around the organs in your midsection in the lower part of your body.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=264s)** — Other symptoms of fatty liver could be itchy skin. The solution for that is to go on a
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=271s)** — healthy ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting. And you're going to have to definitely
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=276s)** — avoid alcohol, eating frequently like snacks. And you may even want to take some choline,
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=282s)** — which actually can help strip off fat from the liver. All right, number five, gallstones.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=287s)** — Some of the warning signs for a gallstone would be your urine is darker, your stool
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=293s)** — floats, your stool is light colored, or you might have constipation. All of those items
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=299s)** — I mentioned are a symptom of low bile salts. Bile salts are made by the liver,
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=307s)** — stored in the gallbladder. And when you don't have enough bile, you start developing
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=312s)** — a super concentrated crystal form of cholesterol. If you had enough bile,
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=320s)** — it would dissolve all that cholesterol. But you don't. So now you get these cholesterol
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=324s)** — stones that are developing because you don't have enough bile. So the solution for this
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=329s)** — is to add more bile salts and then do that for a period of time. Next disease I want to talk
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=334s)** — about is kidney stones. One of the early warning signs of a kidney stone is a kind of a deep
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=339s)** — pain that is either on the left abdominal area or the right side. Or it could be in the back
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=347s)** — part called flank pain, which is usually going to be like a dull, achy like pain on one side.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=353s)** — There's this little tube between your kidney and then the bladder called a ureter. And a lot
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=359s)** — of times if the stone is stuck in there or right before that at the level of the kidney,
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=364s)** — that can back up pressure and you can feel pain, especially in the deeper part of your
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=371s)** — abdomen. So if you have this, what I would recommend is you start doing lemon juice, like
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=376s)** — at least two ounces with water. You can drink it down, fresh lemon or just lemon juice,
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=381s)** — because you need that citric acid to help it combine with the oxalates, which are the most
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=386s)** — common stone. Combine with that at least two and a half liters of fluid a day, because that
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=391s)** — way you can prevent the super saturation from happening. Another really good thing to take would
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=395s)** — be magnesium. I would take magnesium glycinate and I would also avoid foods high in oxalates.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=401s)** — Okay, that would be almonds and almond flour, chocolate and spinach. All right, number seven,
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=409s)** — what kind of early warning signs would be an ulcer? Well, there's not really any early warning
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=415s)** — signs, but there are signs because most of the time it's asymptomatic. If you have an ulcer,
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=421s)** — you're going to have pain or burning pain in your stomach area. You'll feel better when you
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=427s)** — eat. Now, if you eat and you get stomach pain, usually that's not an ulcer. That's indigestion
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=433s)** — because you don't have enough stomach acid. And the remedy for that would be betaine
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=437s)** — hydrochloride. But if you have pain on an empty stomach and you have an ulcer, if you added
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=442s)** — betaine hydrochloride, which is an acid, that's going to make it worse, which then you'll know
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=446s)** — it's an acid, right? And the remedy for that would be wheatgrass juice powder with water,
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=452s)** — and then drink that down as a chlorophyll healing agent. Another good remedy would be zinc
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=458s)** — carnosine, whether you have an ulcer in the stomach or the small intestine. And then number
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=464s)** — diabetes. Okay, what are some early warning signs of diabetes? It's very difficult for you to skip
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=470s)** — a meal without being really super hungry. You may be hangry, which is kind of a combination of
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=475s)** — hungry and angry, irritated when you don't eat, and then you feel better or you're nicer to
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=481s)** — be around when you eat. You may also crave carbs. You may need a nap after you eat. You
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=492s)** — start to have this urinary frequency thing where you start to urinate more and you're more
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=497s)** — thirsty. And it just blows my mind what the medical profession does for diabetes. I mean,
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=502s)** — they give you a medication to lower your blood sugar, but they don't change your diet. You
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=507s)** — need to get off carbs. You need to go low carb and you don't want to be eating all these
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=512s)** — snacks. We want to do intermittent fasting and the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. Now,
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=517s)** — I've done a lot of videos on how to use various clues to figure things out.
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpg9J3qUkU&t=523s)** — If you have not seen this video, I think you'll be very interested in it.
