- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=0s)** — Now I have a question. Would you buy this product if I added multodextrin to it?
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=7s)** — Chances are you probably wouldn't. Okay? I'm going to teach you a scientific,
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=11s)** — simple, quick test that you can apply to any food or supplement to determine
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=18s)** — if there is hidden starches, okay? Like multodextrin by simply adding a little iodine.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=26s)** — Check this out. All right. I'm going to show you an experiment. This test is to determine if there
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=32s)** — are carbohydrates in your supplements or even your food, okay? And primarily I'm going to focus
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=38s)** — on multodextrin because that's the hidden carb, which is really a sugar, in a lot of
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=45s)** — supplements, especially in flavors. Now, the works like this. All you need is some iodine,
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=51s)** — okay? If you combine iodine with the starch, it turns the color blue. Now, if we take just normal
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=58s)** — water, okay? I'm just going to take water. We just take a drop or two of iodine in just
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=69s)** — regular water, tap water. You can see it doesn't turn blue. It stays kind of gold and yellow,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=76s)** — okay? But if we take some iodine on some wonderful bread, you can see it will turn it blue,
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=87s)** — okay? That's the chemical reaction that occurs, which I'm not going to get into why, but
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=91s)** — it just does that. Now, if we take pure multodextrin, for example, and put it in some
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=97s)** — water right here, okay? Mix it up. Put a couple drops of iodine in it. You can see
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=110s)** — the color blue or purple. Okay, that's pure multodextrin. Now, let's take this other
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=120s)** — electrolyte powder, which is a competitor's brand, which has a very similar formula to
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=127s)** — a copycat formula. They state that this is without sugar or multodextrin. Okay, cool.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=137s)** — Okay, so let's add a scoop of that and a couple drops of iodine. Let's see if it has
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=145s)** — multodextrin in there. Whoa! Turns purple blue. Apparently it does.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=159s)** — All right, now let's take my electrolyte powder. Let's see if it has any multodextrin in there or
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=164s)** — or carbs, starches, I mean. Okay, mix it here. Let's put a couple drops of iodine in there.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=178s)** — No purple, no multodextrin. In fact, let's put some even more iodine in there.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=185s)** — See if it eventually turns it purple. And the answer is no. It stays yellow gold.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=194s)** — And you can try this with anything. Okay, so you just need some iodine and you can add it to
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=200s)** — the food or put it in some liquid if there's a powder. And you can detect hidden multodextrin
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=206s)** — and other starches in your supplements and food. As I went ahead and did the iodine tests
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=211s)** — on every single one of my products. And I also learned something new about this iodine test or
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=219s)** — starch test. And that is this iodine will also react against chlorophyll. And so if a product
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=225s)** — has chlorophyll like a wheatgrass juice powder or cruciferous or a leafy green, because of the
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=231s)** — pigment chlorophyll in interacting with iodine, it will turn the substance a little bit brown.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=237s)** — Not purple, but brown. We also learned that if a product has inulin, it can also alter the color.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=246s)** — So I just wanted to bring that up because it's not just multodextrin or other starches
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=251s)** — that can turn things a different color. All right, so now that you know how to determine
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=255s)** — if there are hidden starches in your products that you buy. Let's talk a little bit more about
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=262s)** — hidden starches. And the main starch that is put in so many of these products is multodextrin.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=269s)** — It's a nearly four billion dollar industry. Where are they putting all this multodextrin?
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=275s)** — Well, they use it as a bulking agent, a thickening agent, a carrier for various things
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=282s)** — like flavorings. They use it to add certain texture. They use it to increase shelf life.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=289s)** — They promote it as being plant-based and something that's very, very inexpensive.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=294s)** — One metric ton of this stuff is like only $520. So if a manufacturing company wants to use it
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=302s)** — to add something as a filler, maybe add some texture, they're only spending pennies. Okay,
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=307s)** — so the profit can go very, very high. There's some other sneaky added benefits
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=311s)** — to a company that you should know about. Number one, multodextrin can be classified
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=317s)** — on the label as a carbohydrate, but not as a sugar. Despite behaving like a sugar,
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=325s)** — I mean on the glycemic index, you have table sugar, 65. Glucose, 100. Multodextrin is
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=335s)** — between 105 and 185. I mean, when that stuff hits your bloodstream, you are majorly spiking
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=341s)** — your blood sugars and majorly increasing insulin. And what's wild is there's a
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=347s)** — carbohydrate and not as a sugar. In fact, and also when multodextrin is .5 grams per
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=356s)** — serving size, they don't have to list multodextrin on the label. And it's usually
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=362s)** — made from corn, but it's also made from wheat, rice, potato. But many of the supplements
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=368s)** — that you are probably taking right now have it in there as a hidden ingredient
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=371s)** — for various reasons. One, as a kind of a carrier or a conversion of liquid
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=378s)** — flavoring to powdered flavoring. In fact, it was very, very difficult for me to find
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=384s)** — a flavoring company that did not use multodextrin. And unfortunately, many of
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=387s)** — the supplement companies out there are developed and formulated by marketers who don't really
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=393s)** — care about the quality. But you have flavorings, you have supplements, you have energy gels
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=399s)** — that are used for long distance runners that actually even have in the label like sugar free,
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=405s)** — but it's just filled with hidden sugars as carbohydrates. They're even going after the
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=412s)** — baby formulas. Yeah, baby formula, loaded with multodextrin. And definitely the sports
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=419s)** — products in muscle building, powders, energy drinks, etc. But unfortunately, a lot of
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=427s)** — people don't know about this. It's that little dirty secret that if people found out,
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=432s)** — they wouldn't buy a product that has this very, very high glycemic index sugar in it.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=437s)** — If you're going to exercise, right, and you're going to take a sports drink or sports gel,
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=442s)** — would it help to have that be candy or sugar? Does that improve your performance? Really? No,
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=449s)** — it's going to spike your blood sugars and it's going to come down and you're going to
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=457s)** — suppose to be keto friendly. They're not very keto friendly. And this could definitely be one
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=463s)** — reason why people might try keto with some of these products, unknowingly not able to get
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=469s)** — into keto because of the amount of hidden multodextrin. And then maybe say, well,
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=475s)** — you know, it didn't work. Let me go on to the next diet. So I just wanted to create
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=478s)** — this video to teach you a tool that you can use using simple iodine. And since we're on
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=485s)** — topic of multodextrin, if you haven't seen this video, you definitely need to check it out. I put
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyAbqak0xk&t=489s)** — it up right here.
