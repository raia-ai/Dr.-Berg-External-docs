- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=0s)** — So I've gotten this question a lot.
- **[00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=2s)** — What remedy
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=3s)** — can help with my brittle nails?
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=6s)** — Now that's a good question because there's a lot of different remedies that can work,
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=9s)** — but I always like to use the nail as an indicator
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=13s)** — to look deeper inside the body. And the nail is a really good place to start
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=17s)** — because it gives you a lot of clues
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=19s)** — on what's going on in the body. But brittle nails is very similar to like
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=23s)** — a symptom of fatigue.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=25s)** — There could be many different reasons for that problem.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=28s)** — So you have several options. You can actually take a remedy to strengthen your nails
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=32s)** — or better yet you can try to understand what the nail is doing
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=37s)** — so you can actually fix the problem once and for all. Unfortunately in medicine
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=41s)** — they don't do that.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=43s)** — Everything is based on
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=45s)** — a certain symptom and a treatment. So today let's do this differently. Let's take a
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=49s)** — look at the nail
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=50s)** — and look at all the potential reasons why you might have
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=54s)** — slow growing nails or brittle nails or lines to your nails
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=59s)** — or a problem with the nail. And when I go through this I think what's going to
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=63s)** — happen is one or two things that I talk about
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=66s)** — will become more real to you and it will pop out as a potential problem.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=71s)** — Let's say for example something that's missing in your diet or maybe
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=74s)** — something that you're eating that you shouldn't be eating. So let's start out
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=77s)** — with
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=78s)** — protein. Your nail is protein. It's a very specific type of protein called
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=83s)** — and the thing that you need to know about
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=85s)** — is that it's
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=87s)** — very high in
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=90s)** — and also amino acids because protein is just a combination of
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=95s)** — amino acids. So doing a deep dive and understanding kind of what's making up
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=99s)** — this specific body tissue
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=100s)** — can give you clues on what you may need to eat more of. So the two main
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=105s)** — sulfur amino acids
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=107s)** — are cysteine
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=109s)** — and
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=109s)** — methionine.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=111s)** — And so for example if you're
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=112s)** — eating foods that don't have
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=115s)** — those two amino acids
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=116s)** — or are incomplete
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=118s)** — that could be the reason why you are missing those amino acids and
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=121s)** — developing problems with your nail.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=123s)** — And realize if you have a problem with your nails it's not just
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=125s)** — happening with your nails
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=127s)** — it's happening all over the place.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=129s)** — So you could either be deficient in sulfur
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=132s)** — which by the way the number one symptom
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=134s)** — of a sulfur deficiency
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=136s)** — is brittle nails
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=137s)** — or it can be very specific amino acids that you're deficient in
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=140s)** — because you're eating foods that are not complete with the amino acids.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=145s)** — Now rather than
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=146s)** — bore you and complicate things
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=148s)** — tell you all the foods that don't have that
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=150s)** — I'm just going to recommend
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=152s)** — eating foods that contain
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=154s)** — plenty of all of the amino acids. That way you don't have to worry about
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=159s)** — trying to focus on
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=160s)** — just increasing very specific amino acids. You've got to realize that amino acids is not just about
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=165s)** — making your
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=167s)** — nails, your hair, your muscle, your skin.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=169s)** — It's about making all these other proteins involved with
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=173s)** — biochemistry, energy production, digestion,
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=176s)** — everything. Your body has millions of different enzymes
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=179s)** — and they need these amino acids.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=181s)** — So what kind of foods can you eat to get a complete
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=184s)** — amino acid profile?
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=187s)** — Well the best foods you can eat would be animal products, specifically
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=191s)** — things like eggs, fish,
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=194s)** — meats,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=195s)** — versus
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=196s)** — legumes
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=197s)** — or grain type proteins.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=199s)** — With those you're always going to be missing
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=202s)** — one or two amino acids or
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=204s)** — those amino acids are going to be very very low
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=206s)** — and you're going to have to do
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=209s)** — food combining
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=210s)** — to fix this problem.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=212s)** — You also have the factor of the hydrochloric acid in your stomach. If you don't have
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=215s)** — enough hydrochloric acid you can't
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=217s)** — digest these
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=219s)** — proteins to extract amino acids from the protein.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=222s)** — And so how do you know if you have
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=224s)** — a lack of hydrochloric acid? Well you have indigestion, you have gas, you have bloating,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=229s)** — heartburn. If you have intestinal inflammation
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=233s)** — you could also have a problem with amino acid absorption. Now the other
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=238s)** — thing that's interesting about protein is that
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=241s)** — you may tend to
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=244s)** — not be satisfied when you eat unless you have
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=247s)** — sufficient amount of
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=250s)** — that balanced
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=251s)** — amino acids as your requirement.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=253s)** — Because out of all the macronutrients like carbs, protein, and fats,
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=257s)** — proteins are probably needed as the most important survival
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=261s)** — raw material. And so in other words, let's say you're eating a lot of food
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=266s)** — but you're not
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=268s)** — hitting that requirement for amino acids.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=272s)** — The hunger won't turn off. You'll just stay hungry. You'll never be satisfied.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=276s)** — So this is one problem with vegans.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=278s)** — Is that they'll tend to try to get their amino acids
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=281s)** — from plant type things and grains and legumes. But since they need to consume
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=286s)** — so much of those foods to get the required amount of amino acids
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=291s)** — they end up overdoing it on the carbohydrates. Now if you want a general
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=296s)** — pretty good estimate of how much protein a person would need on average.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=300s)** — Now
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=301s)** — this is on average. It could go up, it could go down.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=304s)** — I would do this. I would take
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=306s)** — .64
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=308s)** — grams times your body weight in pounds
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=311s)** — that you weigh and you get a good estimate of roughly how much protein
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=315s)** — that your body requires. You know when you're deficient in amino acids, boy,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=319s)** — all sorts of things will happen. Not just the
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=322s)** — increase in appetite without being satisfied
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=325s)** — but you could even develop edema in your legs,
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=329s)** — a swollen belly. You can be chronically fatigued.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=332s)** — But again, I'm just emphasizing out of all the macro nutrients
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=336s)** — protein is the most important. And if you're deficient in amino acids and
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=340s)** — it's showing up in your nail,
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=342s)** — realize it's also going to be affecting your immune system,
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=346s)** — your endocrine system, your reproductive system.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=349s)** — The next topic is trace minerals and minerals.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=353s)** — Trace minerals act as helper
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=355s)** — called cofactors or coenzymes for
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=359s)** — proteins. So we just talked about amino acids which are proteins.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=362s)** — Now to activate these proteins that
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=366s)** — help you grow nails, you need certain
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=370s)** — helper minerals or trace minerals which are
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=373s)** — just kind of minerals needed in smaller amounts. So the most important
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=377s)** — mineral would be sulfur. You can get it in cruciferous
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=381s)** — vegetables. You can get it in eggs.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=385s)** — You can get it in meats and fish.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=388s)** — You can also get it in garlic and onion.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=391s)** — There's also a product that can help brittle nails called
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=394s)** — MSM. But I would recommend try to get it from the food.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=398s)** — Then you have zinc, another very very important
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=401s)** — cofactor. Where do you get zinc? Red meat,
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=404s)** — animal products, shellfish, seafood.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=408s)** — Selenium is another one. Copper is another one.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=411s)** — Magnesium is a factor. It's not very common but
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=413s)** — it can show up in the nails if you're deficient in magnesium and that
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=417s)** — would be more of the leafy greens.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=418s)** — But the amount of calcium that's in the nail is
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=422s)** — very very very tiny. So if you have a calcium
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=425s)** — deficiency it's probably not going to show up necessarily in brittle nails.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=428s)** — I mean potentially it could but it's more likely these other elements.
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=432s)** — Silicon also. A lot of people take silicon to
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=435s)** — improve their nails because silicon is involved in the formation of
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=438s)** — collagen. Now another important vitamin
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=441s)** — to strengthen the nails is vitamin C.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=445s)** — Now typically you're going to get enough C if you're doing leafy green.
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=448s)** — Or sauerkraut.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=451s)** — Or peppers. Or lemons.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=454s)** — But if you're consuming a lot of sugar that is definitely going to block
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=458s)** — your vitamin C. Biotin is another
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=462s)** — B vitamin that people take
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=464s)** — in very high levels to help their nails.
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=468s)** — And yes that will work but what you have to realize is that
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=471s)** — you produce just as much
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=474s)** — Biotin as you get from your diet.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=477s)** — And chances are
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=478s)** — the real reason why you might be deficient in Biotin has to do with
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=481s)** — your gut microflora
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=484s)** — more than your diet. Maybe you had an antibiotic.
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=488s)** — Maybe you have some type of gut issue. Maybe you're
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=490s)** — not eating right. Maybe you don't eat enough probiotic
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=493s)** — foods or prebiotic foods. And that's
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=496s)** — why you're low in Biotin. But Biotin is very high in
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=499s)** — chicken liver, beef liver,
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=502s)** — eggs, salmon, and pork. And
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=505s)** — a couple other reasons why you might be deficient in Biotin.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=508s)** — You drink a good amount of alcohol. You're on some type of
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=511s)** — medication. You have low hydrochloric acid.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=514s)** — You are an athlete. You exercise
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=517s)** — a lot. That can create a major deficiency in Biotin.
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=520s)** — Or you're getting older. And so the
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=523s)** — requirements for Biotin go up. B6 is another vitamin
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=526s)** — that is involved in the production of protein.
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=529s)** — But typically it's not going to be very common for you
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=532s)** — to have brittle nails if you have a B6 deficiency.
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=536s)** — B12 is another factor that can
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=538s)** — affect the blood flow to the nail. Any type of anemia,
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=541s)** — whether it's B12 or iron, can
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=544s)** — show up in the nail as a brittle nail.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=547s)** — Choline is another...they classify it as
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=550s)** — a B vitamin. If you're deficient in choline,
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=553s)** — maybe you have a genetic factor that doesn't allow you to absorb
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=555s)** — choline like myself. And that puts you at risk
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=559s)** — for a fatty liver. And if you want to eat foods
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=562s)** — high in choline, eat more egg yolks.
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=565s)** — Now to keep the keratin strong, there are two
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=568s)** — fat soluble vitamins that are also very important.
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=570s)** — Vitamin A and vitamin D.
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=573s)** — Where do you get vitamin A from? I'm not talking about like
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=576s)** — spinach. That's beta keratin, which turns into
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=579s)** — vitamin A, but just a small amount.
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=582s)** — You want to get your vitamin A from egg yolk,
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=586s)** — fish, or animal organs,
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=588s)** — like liver and things like that, or even cod liver
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=590s)** — oil. And of course vitamin D is difficult to get from the
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=593s)** — food, but cod liver oil has it. You can get it
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=596s)** — from the sun. And other types of fatty fish or seafood
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=599s)** — has some vitamin D in it.
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=602s)** — Now, I created another video on nails that's actually
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=605s)** — quite interesting that goes beyond just the brittle
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=608s)** — nail. And if you haven't seen that video, I put it up right here.
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ2jCDQMQ00&t=611s)** — Check it out.
