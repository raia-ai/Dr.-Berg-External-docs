- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=0s)** — Let's show you the seven ways to burn more fat while you are sleeping. There's nothing worse than
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=7s)** — poor sleep to stop you from burning fat. I had this patient who came in long ago who lifted
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=14s)** — over three million pounds in the gym over a course of a year. She was hardcore dedicated and she
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=20s)** — lost I think one or two pounds. Very depressed. The problem that she had was she wasn't sleeping
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=26s)** — that great. I fixed her sleep with what I'm going to show you now. And the first month she lost 16
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=33s)** — pounds. So let's start with number seven. Work backwards. Then I'll eventually get to the most
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=40s)** — important thing you need to do out of all of these tips. Okay, number seven. You want to
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=45s)** — let your appetite dictate what fasting pattern that you should be on. And then because you
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=50s)** — don't have an appetite, it allows you to go longer. And you just really want to pay attention,
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=54s)** — be in tune with your appetite. So if you're not hungry, just don't eat. All right, number six.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=60s)** — Reduce the extra excess fat, extra butter and MCT oil in the coffee or you're adding more
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=68s)** — fat. Don't do that. What we want to do is we want to force our bodies to burn our own
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=74s)** — body fat and not the dietary fat. I don't want you to go low fat. But I don't want you to add
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=80s)** — additional fat that is excess to the normal fat that comes with your protein, your meat,
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=85s)** — things like that. Number five. Make sure your carbs aren't too high. I think an easy way to
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=90s)** — do it without having to count carbs is just to eat meat and vegetables. Most vegetables,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=95s)** — especially salads, they don't have a lot of carbs. They have a lot of fiber. You're not
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=100s)** — going to ever gain weight on salad. I'm sorry. If anyone ever says that, they don't
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=104s)** — know what you're talking about. Some people might have a thyroid issue and they have a hard
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=110s)** — time converting T4 to T3. T3 is like the active form of the thyroid hormone. This happens in
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=115s)** — some people, especially when they go low carb for a longer period of time. What they should do
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=120s)** — to solve this is not to start adding a lot of sugar and stuff like that, but just add more
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=127s)** — berries. That would be something that could potentially help your sleep because it helps the
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=133s)** — thyroid. And if you're getting bloating, you're not on the right eating plan. Start
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=136s)** — eliminating things. The nuts. Maybe you eliminate the cheese, that type of thing, or dairy. And
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=142s)** — some people that have inflammation in their gut do very well in the carnivore diet,
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=148s)** — which is also a diet that eliminates a lot of potential things that bloat you. Now let's go
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=154s)** — to four. Overall sleep hygiene. Making sure that you invest in a good mattress. I'm telling
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=160s)** — you, you spend one third of your life in bed. Might as well invest in a good mattress. The
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=167s)** — best way to get a mattress is to go to a mattress store and start testing things out
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=171s)** — because some people do better on the softer. Some people do better on the firmer. Make sure
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=175s)** — the room is not too hot. If you can crack the window open and get more fresh air,
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=180s)** — that would be great. If you have a dog in your bed that keeps you up, you're going to
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=186s)** — put the dog somewhere else because I mean just the excess noise and the movement in bed.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=193s)** — And unfortunately, if you're sleeping with someone that snores, it just throws everything
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=197s)** — off. Growing up, I slept in the basement. Okay, it was cool, dark, and boy, that was great
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=204s)** — because I could just bundle up and go to sleep and it was the best sleep environment.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=208s)** — Nowadays, there's lights on. We have the computer, the LED lights, the blue lights. It's
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=213s)** — very, very bad for sleep. So you really want to start dimming the lights early on. The more light
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=220s)** — you have, especially blue light, that's going to interrupt the melatonin. So that's going to
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=223s)** — prevent you from going to sleep. Now we're at number three. These are sleep aids. Okay,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=228s)** — apple cider vinegar through the day, like maybe once or twice or three times in some
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=233s)** — water, like a tablespoon. That'll help your blood sugar. It will help you sleep. So that's
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=239s)** — two. Collagen is a good supplement to take. One third of it is glycine. Glycine is usually
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=246s)** — deficient in most people. Glycine is needed to sleep. Another remedy is niacinamide. Take a
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=253s)** — little bit, maybe 100 to 150 milligrams at a time. Vitamin D is also very important for
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=258s)** — sleep cycles. Sometimes I'll take vitamin D right before bed. It really helps, especially
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=263s)** — And lastly, sea salt. All right, number two, do a full workout where your whole body gets
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=270s)** — not just tired, but you sweat. Okay, so you want to push yourself to the intensity that
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=276s)** — if you're doing weights, it's to a failure. Okay, so we don't want to just do a little
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=282s)** — exercise, maybe in the beginning, but you want to graduate to something more intense. Let's
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=287s)** — say you're sprinting up a hill and you hit a wall. That would be good. You know, do several
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=291s)** — those because we want to do enough exercise to deplete the energy in your body and also
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=297s)** — stimulate growth hormone. Growth hormone is activated by the intensity of exercise. So we
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=304s)** — want that workout, but not very frequently. Those people who had the hardest time losing
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=308s)** — weight were the most desperate and serious about it. And that alone, that mindset,
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=316s)** — that emotion stresses people out and it adds more cortisol. So I highly recommend you go about
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=323s)** — this in a relaxed manner as much as possible and relaxed and don't worry about it so much.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=329s)** — Self-induced stress can activate cortisol. Don't expect things just to bounce back right
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=334s)** — off the bat. You have to have what's called in medicine, patience. This is why we put you in
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=341s)** — a waiting room, right? And also when you're starting out weight loss, especially if you're
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=346s)** — menopausal, you don't just have a weight loss problem. You have also a loss of muscle problem
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=351s)** — that's called atrophy. And in the process of healing, sleeping, you're going to rebuild
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=357s)** — muscle. All right, number one, the most important tip, okay? You want to go to bed
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=363s)** — between nine and nine thirty. Okay? And you want to sleep for nine hours. Now,
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=370s)** — before you think I'm crazy, let me tell you why. Think about what's going to happen. You're going
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=376s)** — to get a lot more repair of proteins, muscle, and your metabolism is a function of how much
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=383s)** — lean muscle mass you have. You think you're like wasting the day away, but you're actually
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=387s)** — doing a lot of productive work with your body. It's part of the healing phase. So get that
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=391s)** — nine hours of sleep, be in bed by nine, nine thirty. And if you can't sleep that long,
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=396s)** — maybe you take a nap or you get up and you go back to sleep. But the point is that the more sleep,
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=401s)** — especially in the beginning, the better, the more weight loss. Why? Because you burn all the fat
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=405s)** — while you're sleeping. So might as well ride the wave. So since we're on this topic of sleep,
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=409s)** — I think it's really important to know a little bit more about this hormone cortisol that can
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=413s)** — prevent you from going to sleep. And I have this wonderful download on my website that you
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vpuB13Lvg&t=418s)** — can download all the things that help you reduce cortisol in one document. So click the
