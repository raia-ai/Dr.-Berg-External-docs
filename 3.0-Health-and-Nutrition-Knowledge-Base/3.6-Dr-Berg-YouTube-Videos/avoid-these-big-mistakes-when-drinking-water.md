- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=0s)** — I'd like to talk about three really common mistakes that a lot of people make when they start the ketogenic diet.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=6s)** — So when interviewing people who are either plateaued or they're running into problems,
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=12s)** — these three things keep coming up over and over and over again.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=14s)** — So I'm going to make it really simple and this is going to be a fairly quick video,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=19s)** — but these are very important points.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=22s)** — So that way, if you're starting keto, you can be very successful.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=26s)** — And the first mistake relates to fat, okay?
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=29s)** — People sometimes think that a ketogenic diet is just a high-fat diet,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=33s)** — and that's what makes you burn fat and turn it into ketones.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=39s)** — That's not true. It's not eating more fat.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=41s)** — Eating more fat is not going to make you more into ketosis.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=44s)** — It's the lowering of carbohydrates.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=46s)** — Now, what is an average person trying to fix when they go on keto?
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=50s)** — They're trying to fix problems with their insulin, okay?
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=56s)** — Primarily this thing called insulin resistance.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=58s)** — Insulin resistance is basically the pre-stage before diabetes.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=64s)** — It starts off mild, it gets worse, worse, and worse
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=67s)** — until the point where it becomes advanced insulin resistance,
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=70s)** — and then you become a pre-diabetic and a diabetic.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=73s)** — So diabetes is advanced insulin resistance.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=77s)** — Now let's just take a look at a really,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=80s)** — like probably the most important function of insulin.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=84s)** — Insulin prevents the loss of fat.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=89s)** — It's a survival mechanism.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=91s)** — Yes, it does help you store fat,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=93s)** — but it prevents the burning of fat.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=95s)** — It also prevents the loss of proteins in the body.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=98s)** — Like, if you think about a diabetic type one,
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=102s)** — where they have no more insulin,
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=103s)** — and what happens with them?
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=105s)** — They're really skinny.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=106s)** — But what's confusing to some people is that,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=108s)** — wow, they're a diabetic, they should be fat.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=110s)** — Now, a lot of times when you have type one,
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=111s)** — you're very, very skinny.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=112s)** — Why?
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=113s)** — Because you have no more insulin to store anything.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=116s)** — So everything just tends to just end up in the blood.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=119s)** — So you have high levels of fat in the blood
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=121s)** — that then don't get stored.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=123s)** — You end up with high levels of sugar,
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=124s)** — and you lose a lot of protein too.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=127s)** — So it's a really nasty problem, diabetes type one.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=129s)** — So how does this relate to fat?
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=132s)** — In order for you to even develop diabetes
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=135s)** — in the first place, advanced insulin resistance,
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=137s)** — or even insulin resistance,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=139s)** — there has to first be a problem in your fat cells,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=143s)** — where your fat cells have insulin resistance.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=146s)** — In other words, there's this dysfunctional fat cell
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=150s)** — that can no longer store fat.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=153s)** — So as a protective mechanism,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=155s)** — the fat cell has to stop that fat from going in.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=157s)** — So it develops this resistance against insulin.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=160s)** — So we no longer have this storage mechanism
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=162s)** — in the fat cell.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=163s)** — But now where does that fat go?
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=164s)** — The fat is now gonna be accumulated outside
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=168s)** — the fat cell.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=169s)** — Okay, that's called ectopic fat.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=172s)** — It's not in the adipocyte anymore.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=175s)** — You're gonna get fatty muscle.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=177s)** — It's gonna be in your liver.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=178s)** — It's gonna be around the organs.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=180s)** — It's gonna be inside the pancreas.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=182s)** — It's gonna be all over the place.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=183s)** — That is when you start developing insulin resistance
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=187s)** — to a point where then it switches to diabetes.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=191s)** — So let's just take a look at that one point
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=193s)** — for a second.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=194s)** — If you're gonna go on keto to fix insulin resistance
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=199s)** — and you're a pre-diabetic or you're diabetic,
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=202s)** — would it make sense to really stuff yourself
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=204s)** — with more fat?
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=206s)** — That's gonna contribute to the problem.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=208s)** — So one of the biggest mistakes on keto
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=209s)** — is people just do unlimited fat.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=212s)** — They do bulletproof coffee.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=213s)** — They're downing tons of butter.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=215s)** — They're doing keto fat bombs.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=217s)** — I actually have a recipe channel
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=219s)** — that teaches you how to make these recipes,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=222s)** — but I do think they serve one purpose
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=223s)** — is when you first start keto
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=225s)** — and you're making this transition
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=226s)** — and you wanna make it easy
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=227s)** — and you eat more fat to be able to fast longer,
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=230s)** — okay, that's a good reason.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=231s)** — But after you've adapted and you're doing good,
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=235s)** — I don't recommend continuing to just dump
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=239s)** — unlimited amount of fat in your system.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=241s)** — What you should do is consume the fat
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=243s)** — that normally comes with the protein.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=245s)** — Don't go low fat.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=247s)** — Don't avoid fat,
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=248s)** — but just don't consume a lot of extra fat,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=251s)** — especially if you're trying to fix insulin resistance
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=255s)** — and diabetes.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=257s)** — So when someone's like plateaued with their weight
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=259s)** — and I asked them what they're eating
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=263s)** — and then I find out they're eating
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=264s)** — like all this extra fat,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=266s)** — like I'll have them make that change
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=268s)** — and they'll do much better.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=269s)** — On the flip side of that,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=270s)** — there are certain programs like ideal protein
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=274s)** — that is protein, low carb and low fat.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=280s)** — But the problem is the quality of ingredients
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=282s)** — are really crappy.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=283s)** — They're getting their protein from soy protein isolates
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=286s)** — and all that stuff.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=286s)** — So that's not necessarily one of the mistakes.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=288s)** — I just want to bring that up.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=290s)** — You want to use healthy ingredients as well,
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=293s)** — like real food,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=294s)** — which relates to the mistake number two.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=296s)** — I mean, this concept of keto snacks
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=300s)** — goes completely against what we're trying to do
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=303s)** — because insulin is not just increased by carbs,
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=307s)** — it's also increased by eating
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=310s)** — and these snacks are going to really just raise
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=312s)** — your insulin.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=313s)** — Especially if you're buying all these snacks,
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=315s)** — you're going to be eating them through the day.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=316s)** — I mean, just go on Amazon and type keto snacks.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=320s)** — There's just everything from keto ice cream,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=324s)** — the so-called protein shakes,
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=326s)** — there's chips, there's cookies.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=328s)** — It just goes on and on and on.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=330s)** — And if you read the label on this,
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=331s)** — they're filled with things like polydextrose
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=334s)** — and dextrose and all these new fibers
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=335s)** — that haven't been tested, tapioca, corn, fiber.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=339s)** — And just because something says keto
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=341s)** — does not even make it keto.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=342s)** — But the point is that you don't want to do these snacks.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=346s)** — I can see using some of these as dessert occasionally,
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=349s)** — but I don't do a lot of these keto snacks.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=351s)** — And that is a big reason why people are failing on keto
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=354s)** — because they're doing all this keto snacks
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=357s)** — and the ingredients are not even keto.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=360s)** — Especially when you get into the Atkins type,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=363s)** — so-called keto friendly foods,
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=364s)** — and then you have slim fast.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=366s)** — But if you see ingredients like maltitol,
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=369s)** — I mean, that's just like almost the same as sugar.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=371s)** — And I have found just by cutting out the keto snacks
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=373s)** — that people do very well, just eat real food.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=376s)** — Don't make your meal a bar, like a keto bar,
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=381s)** — even if they're the correct macros,
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=382s)** — because it's just not real food.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=384s)** — All right, number three, hidden carbohydrates.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=388s)** — And a big one is this maltodextrin.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=391s)** — It's even in your supplements.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=392s)** — It's in the electrolyte powders.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=394s)** — I've done a video on that.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=395s)** — And I think another big thing is too many berries and fruit.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=401s)** — I've had people say, well, fruit has fructose.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=403s)** — Fruit has half fructose and half glucose.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=407s)** — So yes, fructose is low in the glycemic index,
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=411s)** — but your liver is the only organ that can handle fructose
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=415s)** — and it is gonna create a major problem
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=416s)** — with insulin resistance.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=418s)** — So even though it's low in the glycemic index,
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=421s)** — it's still a big problem.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=423s)** — And out of all the things that are very high in fructose,
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=426s)** — a GAVA Nectar is right at the top.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=428s)** — And if you look at GAVA Nectar in some products,
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=431s)** — it says, oh yeah, it's keto friendly
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=432s)** — because it's low in the glycemic index.
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=434s)** — Well, that's just like saying like,
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=436s)** — pizza is good because it has tomatoes.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=438s)** — Well, it has other things as well.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=440s)** — Now there's a really good Kindle book
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=443s)** — that I recently got.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=444s)** — I didn't finish it.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=445s)** — So I can't say that I agree with every single point yet,
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=449s)** — but it's called, Don't Eat For The Winter.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=453s)** — And what I like about it, it's written by an engineer.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=456s)** — Okay. And so engineers are good problem solvers.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=458s)** — They think logically.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=460s)** — And this book is so far really interesting
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=462s)** — because the author mentioned like an acorn,
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=465s)** — a squirrel would start to accumulate all these acorns,
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=468s)** — right? And they're gonna eat those through the winter.
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=471s)** — Now an acorn is like 53% fat,
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=474s)** — it's 41% carb and it's like 6% protein.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=479s)** — A very similar profile to junk food.
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=483s)** — And when you combine that much carb with that much fat,
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=486s)** — well, you're gonna create a lot of storage of fat.
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=488s)** — And he also mentions another interesting point about,
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=491s)** — you know, when do we harvest fruits?
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=495s)** — Okay. Like apples, pears, peaches,
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=498s)** — all this fruit is mainly harvested in September,
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=502s)** — October, maybe early November.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=506s)** — It's very unnatural to harvest fruit all year round.
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=510s)** — That fruit, which is higher in fructose,
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=512s)** — tends to act as a survival mechanism
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=513s)** — so you can survive through the winter.
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=515s)** — But of course we have fruit available
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=517s)** — every single day of the year.
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=519s)** — So you can very easily overdo the fruit,
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=521s)** — especially if you add it with fat.
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=523s)** — Our body and our genes have not evolved
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=525s)** — to handle that much fructose.
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=528s)** — So to summarize, number one,
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=530s)** — don't overdo it with the fat.
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=532s)** — Consume the fat that normally comes with protein.
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=534s)** — And also realize when you're drinking all this fat,
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=536s)** — it's not all being oxidized as fat burning.
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=539s)** — A lot of it can be stored as well.
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=540s)** — And as I'm thinking about this,
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=542s)** — there's actually a fourth one that I wanna bring up.
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=544s)** — I mentioned this in another video.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=547s)** — Now, typically the ketogenic diet
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=549s)** — should be a moderate amount of protein,
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=551s)** — and it definitely should be bioavailable,
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=554s)** — complete protein.
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=555s)** — So if you're doing the ketogenic diet
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=558s)** — with plant-based protein
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=559s)** — or just not enough bioavailable protein,
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=563s)** — that's gonna tell the brain to keep eating.
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=566s)** — So out of all the macronutrients,
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=568s)** — carbs, protein, fat,
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=571s)** — protein is the most valuable to the body
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=573s)** — because we don't store it.
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=574s)** — And there's so many different functions
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=576s)** — that are dependent on this protein.
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=578s)** — So this really relates to when you start doing
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=581s)** — more intermittent fasting and prolonged fasting.
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=583s)** — If you're deficient in amino acids,
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=585s)** — going into a prolonged fast,
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=588s)** — you're just not gonna feel good.
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=589s)** — And so for some people that don't feel good,
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=592s)** — it wouldn't hurt to take a blend
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=594s)** — of complete amino acids just to fortify the body.
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=598s)** — Now, to get more information
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=599s)** — on the healthy version of the ketogenic diet,
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=603s)** — I put that video up right here.
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJEAqOdnF2E&t=605s)** — Check it out.
