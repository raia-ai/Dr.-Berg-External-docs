- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=0s)** — Most doctors know the side effects from taking medication.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=3s)** — But what I don't think hardly any doctors really understand is the side effects from taking multiple drugs,
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=9s)** — the interaction between certain drugs.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=11s)** — Let's talk about some really common medications that can actually cause dementia,
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=16s)** — or at least put you at a major risk for getting dementia.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=19s)** — From my viewpoint, I would get really upset if I got a side effect, especially dementia, from another medication.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=27s)** — Let's go through common drugs that have a known side effect of dementia.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=31s)** — First category of drugs are those that block or inhibit acetylcholine.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=36s)** — That's a neurotransmitter.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=37s)** — These drugs include Benadryl, which is antihistamine, certain drugs for depression,
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=42s)** — as well as drugs that treat an overactive bladder.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=46s)** — If someone's on these for a prolonged period of time, the risk for dementia goes way up.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=50s)** — Next one is something called benzodiazepine.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=54s)** — This drug treats anxiety, insomnia, and seizures.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=57s)** — We're talking about Valium and Xanax.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=60s)** — Apparently this drug affects the central nervous system, aka your brain,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=64s)** — and it can greatly increase the risk of getting dementia.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=66s)** — Then we have something called PPIs, proton pump inhibitors.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=70s)** — Those medications treat indigestion, heartburn, like Prilocyte and Nexium.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=76s)** — They can increase the risk of cognitive decline.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=80s)** — Then the last one, which is a big one, is opioids, like morphine or oxycodone.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=85s)** — Anything that creates sedation on the brain, like when you go in for surgery
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=89s)** — and they give you certain anesthetics,
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=90s)** — that can greatly affect your cognitive function leading to dementia.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=95s)** — There's also the side effects from drug interactions.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=98s)** — And unfortunately, as people get older and eventually end up in an assisted living home or nursing home,
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=103s)** — boy, they just are just given medications routinely.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=106s)** — In fact, let's interview this gentleman that owns several assisted living homes
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=111s)** — and see what he has to say.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=113s)** — We have a whole lot of people that come with between 20 and 30 medications each.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=118s)** — Our record is 54. We have a guy who had 54 medications.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=123s)** — What's really unique about your program is you do this very cutting edge,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=130s)** — complex therapy called introducing real food, right?
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=134s)** — Basically, you just... is that simple? You give them real food because as you told me,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=139s)** — like a lot of these nursing facilities or assisted living,
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=142s)** — they're living on all the processed food, right?
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=146s)** — Very much so. Yes. It's what they use for their budget to keep, you know, costs low
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=152s)** — or the big facilities have contracts with large food distribution companies
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=157s)** — and sort of serve what they provide.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=160s)** — You have to work with the family, of course, and because they have to authorize it.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=164s)** — You have a whole protocol and give me an example of what foods that you don't give them.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=170s)** — How long have you got?
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=174s)** — So anything pretty much if you think of the middle aisles of the grocery store,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=179s)** — that's what we avoid. Any packaged food.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=182s)** — We really try to avoid any sugars.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=185s)** — I have a health coach that has taught my cooks and caregivers
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=189s)** — how to prepare the food and what foods to prepare.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=193s)** — She's given us lists of ingredients that are sugar, basically,
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=199s)** — but they don't call it sugar. There's 65 different names for sugar.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=203s)** — She's taught us how to read food labels.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=206s)** — We really try to get one ingredient foods.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=209s)** — When you buy broccoli or you buy steak, there's one ingredient on that list.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=214s)** — And that's kind of how we do it.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=216s)** — Anything with very multiple ingredients or something from a chemistry class,
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=221s)** — we don't serve them.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=223s)** — So simple. Now, tell me, are any of the people coming to you
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=228s)** — kind of eventually getting off some of these meds?
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=231s)** — Oh, tremendously. We argue with their doctors all the time.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=236s)** — We work off their meds frequently.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=240s)** — Our personal goal is to get them off.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=243s)** — We get a lot of diabetics.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=244s)** — So we worked and we've successfully got people off insulin,
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=248s)** — that form and blood pressure medication, statins.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=252s)** — Obviously, we work with all our medical professionals and get them to de-prescribe it.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=258s)** — We have to by the Department of Health have an order to stop the medications.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=263s)** — But we're constantly having those discussions of what we can do.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=266s)** — The guy with 54 medications,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=268s)** — he's living on his own in the department by himself now,
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=272s)** — and he's down around 20 medications.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=275s)** — So give you an example.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=276s)** — Now, you have people that come to you that were actually in hospice?
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=281s)** — Oh, frequently, yes.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=283s)** — They get charged from a hospital or rehab on hospice and come to us.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=287s)** — And we'll work very hard to get them to no longer qualify for hospice.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=292s)** — We call it graduating from hospice.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=295s)** — What type of results are you seeing in general physically?
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=298s)** — Physically, we're seeing all sorts of...
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=300s)** — A lot of the dementia people, we work with an outside company to do a whole bunch of lab testing.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=306s)** — But we see hormone levels go up.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=310s)** — We see inflammation go way down.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=314s)** — Vitamin D levels, all kinds of vitamin levels go up.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=319s)** — Plus, you see it physically.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=321s)** — You know, we have people come bedbound and they go into wheelchairs,
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=326s)** — and the wheelchairs go to walkers, and the walkers go to walking.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=330s)** — So, you know, then they can spend more time with their family.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=334s)** — We had a 98-year-old gentleman go on a cruise with his family for a week.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=341s)** — You know, something he couldn't have done when he first came to us.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=344s)** — And we let them borrow a caregiver.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=346s)** — She got a free cruise out of it.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=349s)** — And, you know, he had the time of his life, came back,
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=353s)** — passed away six months later, but, you know, was very happy those last six months.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=358s)** — Amazing. I'll tell you one thing.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=360s)** — If I know anyone that is in that situation where they need to go somewhere,
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=365s)** — I'm referring them to you. So, I will, I think you're in Arizona.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=368s)** — I'm going to put your link down below so more people can know about it.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=371s)** — But it's incredible. I wish more organizations did what you're doing.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=375s)** — And I think we need to spread the word.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=377s)** — It's really difficult when dealing with someone, a lot of medications,
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=381s)** — to know what is causing what.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=384s)** — The other complexity on top of that is you have multiple doctors involved.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=388s)** — They each have their own viewpoint.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=389s)** — They're each focusing on a different part of the body.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=392s)** — There's this term called adverse drug reactions.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=395s)** — This is the unexpected side effect directly caused from drugs.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=399s)** — 90% of these are under reported.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=401s)** — Adverse drug reactions are responsible for 10% of all hospital visits.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=406s)** — It's also the fourth leading cause of death.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=409s)** — I wanted to bring on a board certified endocrinologist
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=411s)** — and ask her some questions about this topic.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=414s)** — We know drugs have side effects,
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=417s)** — but have we studied the interaction between drugs?
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=421s)** — Patients don't always know.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=423s)** — They get these little package inserts that are in fine print.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=426s)** — Most of us, it's too difficult to read those little tiny papers.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=430s)** — And, you know, where I practice in India,
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=432s)** — a lot of medications just come in aluminum blister packs without any insert.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=438s)** — So the patient may not really have a list of side effects to read through.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=442s)** — Drug interactions is written in tiny print.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=444s)** — Busy doctors are prescribing.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=446s)** — And what I do is I use a free software.
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=450s)** — There's a free version of it. It's called Epocrates.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=453s)** — E-P-O-C-R-A-T-E-S.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=456s)** — And I look for drug interactions there just to keep on top of it.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=460s)** — Because there are so many new medications coming out.
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=462s)** — Even when I was in practice, I would have patients come in.
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=464s)** — They're on 5, 10, 15, up to 20, even more medications.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=470s)** — Are you seeing some of that as well?
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=472s)** — Just the number of prescriptions are just really going high.
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=476s)** — Really long. And especially in the space of where you and I see a lot of things is chronic conditions.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=484s)** — Where it's not a fever or a back sprain and you're done with your medications in 4 to 7 days or a course of antibiotics.
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=492s)** — It's something more prolonged like blood pressure or diabetes.
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=496s)** — And these pills end up not really being looked at as when do we get you off of it?
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=502s)** — That's something I focus on a lot is to keep looking at the medication list to cut back whenever we can.
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=509s)** — And a lot of times the patient is going to different specialists.
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=513s)** — And unfortunately, the busy specialist might be looking at the one body part that they've been asked to look at.
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=519s)** — And they're not always looking at interactions of what I'm prescribing with what maybe the other specialist is prescribing.
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=527s)** — So even though I'm an endocrinologist and I still count as a specialist or a top, you know, super specialized.
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=534s)** — I end up zooming out and doing what a primary care doctor often does is let's look at all these drugs.
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=539s)** — And we're so often surprised you'll see two things that cause constipation, two things that cause drowsiness.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=547s)** — There's so many interactions.
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=549s)** — Even with my mother-in-law, she started noticing signs of Alzheimer's when she was getting older.
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=553s)** — And so I just looked at her medications because she was on quite a few and I'm like, wait a second.
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=559s)** — I started talking to the doctor. I'm like, this causes dementia, right? As a side effect.
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=564s)** — So do we really need it? I think it was a bladder medication because that's a common one that has a side effect of dementia.
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=572s)** — So yeah, off that she's just started doing better.
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=574s)** — But I mean, I'm sure you see it all the time, all the time.
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=577s)** — And sometimes you're prescribing like a pain medication.
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=582s)** — And sometimes rebound pain comes in or an antidepressant.
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=587s)** — And temporarily some people have increased, you know, negative thoughts.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=591s)** — What I really like about you is you include the diet as part of the equation when you evaluate someone like you're you emphasize that.
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=598s)** — I heard a joke recently where a pet owner was joking that, you know, when you go to the vet with your pet,
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=604s)** — the first thing the vet asks you is what are you feeding them?
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=609s)** — Wow, wow, that would be a smart thing to ask.
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=614s)** — But why don't why don't doctors ask that? That's the question for the human pet owners, right?
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=619s)** — And so it seems like an obvious question for the pet.
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=623s)** — I can't think of anything else that contributes to either more health or more disease than what we put in our bodies.
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=629s)** — 100%. And, you know, I talk about this step by step when I when I work with people over three months or six months is
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=636s)** — the four wheels of the lifestyle car. And, you know, the first wheel is always nutrition is what are we putting in the body?
- **[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=643s)** — You're putting a medication in the body. So like we want to reduce the medication.
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=648s)** — What else is going into your mouth or into your body every day is food.
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=652s)** — And then we go into sleep. Then we go into stress management, exercise.
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=656s)** — And after that may be fasting. But the first wheel is always nutrition.
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=660s)** — I also want to talk about some really common symptoms that are directly caused by so many medications.
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=667s)** — Let's take constipation, for example.
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=669s)** — Did you realize that the side effect constipation can come from over a hundred and fifty different medications?
- **[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=676s)** — The problem with chronic constipation is it can lead to something called mega colon where your colon is just enlarged and you can develop infections.
- **[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=684s)** — It can burst. That's why we have laxatives, right?
- **[11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=687s)** — The doctor is going to probably give someone a laxative to try to stimulate the release of this waste.
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=692s)** — The problem with laxatives is they destroy the lining of the colon.
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=696s)** — And also it's hard to come off of them. Your body depends on them.
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=701s)** — With the diabetes medication, what that does is it gets the sugar out of the blood to help normalize the blood sugar.
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=707s)** — But the question is, what does it do with that sugar? It's pushing it through the kidneys, pushing it out through the urine.
- **[11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=712s)** — Of course, when someone has this symptom, they're then put on medications that cause urinary retention.
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=718s)** — Then they get a risk for urinary tract infections.
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=721s)** — Dizziness is another really common side effect of quite a few medications.
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=725s)** — One big problem, especially with the elderly, is that dizziness is the number one cause of why someone, when they're older, falls.
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=733s)** — So dizziness comes from like taking high blood pressure medication, antidepressants, and even sleeping pills.
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=739s)** — There's also something called paradoxical drug side effects.
- **[12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=742s)** — You're taking a medication for a certain effect, but you end up getting that same effect.
- **[12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=749s)** — This happens quite frequently too. You're taking an antidepressant, but it actually caused you to become more depressed.
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=754s)** — Or you take an antacid, and then you end up getting heartburn.
- **[12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=757s)** — One of the biggest reasons why people develop chronic disease.
- **[12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=761s)** — I personally think it comes from what the patient eats.
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=764s)** — I'm primarily talking about processed foods.
- **[12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=766s)** — Junk food is at the top of the list as far as the reason why people go to the doctor for their chronic disease.
- **[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=773s)** — A really big part of big pharma's medications are really about treating the side effect from this processed food.
- **[13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=782s)** — Because the doctor does not really evaluate what the person's eating,
- **[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=786s)** — it's the doctor's omission of real food and that connection between junk food and chronic disease that is literally holding this whole thing together.
- **[13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=795s)** — And it keeps allowing the drugs to be prescribed and then new medications added to treat the side effect from this other drug.
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=803s)** — What is the one thing that can literally turn this whole thing around?
- **[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=807s)** — It's this tiny little simple thing where we're going to switch out the junk food for real food.
- **[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8zzRq8aMo8&t=813s)** — And if you want more information about what real food is, you should check out this video right here.
