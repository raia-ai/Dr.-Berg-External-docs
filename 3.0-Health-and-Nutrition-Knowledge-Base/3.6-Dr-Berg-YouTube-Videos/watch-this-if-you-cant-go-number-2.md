- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=0s)** — There are three steps I'm going to show you to alleviate constipation.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=4s)** — For example, if you take a laxative for over a year, you start to create damage to the nerves
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=11s)** — and the muscles of your colon. And make sure you always read the ingredients. If it has mineral
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=17s)** — oil, do not take it because what that's going to do, it's going to leach out fat soluble
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=23s)** — vitamins from your liver and other parts of your body. The most common type of constipation
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=29s)** — is called primary constipation. There's not like a tumor in there that's abstracting it.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=34s)** — The first line of treatment for primary constipation is polyethylene glycol,
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=41s)** — petroleum based medication. It's also used to preserve wood that's been waterlogged. It's
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=48s)** — used in propellants for missiles for the U.S. Navy. Now it is considered safe, but growing
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=55s)** — evidence has shown that it's becoming a problem. In between 1990 and 1998, they tested people
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=63s)** — and they found over 72% of those who they tested had anti-polyethylene glycol antibodies.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=74s)** — Which means these people have developed a hypersensitivity to this product, which is in
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=79s)** — a lot of different things, including medications, like I mentioned. But when they're exposed to it,
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=84s)** — in other related products, they tend to get hives, might get dizzy. Now what we've been
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=91s)** — told about constipation, of what we need to do, despite hardly any evidence of this being true,
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=97s)** — is to eat more fiber and drink more water and exercise. Ideally, the microbes consume
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=103s)** — most of the fiber so you don't have this undigested fiber that's actually plugging up
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=108s)** — your colon. So if we just kind of step back and look at what we're dealing with,
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=113s)** — we're dealing with a digestive tube or a pipe, which is roughly between 20 and 25 feet. Now
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=120s)** — to the left and right, you have the gallbladder, which squeezes out bile to help you digest the
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=127s)** — fat. And then you have the pancreas, which releases enzymes to start breaking down the food
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=133s)** — and enzymes that are made by the small intestine, all working together to break down
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=138s)** — and absorb nutrients. Now think about this, if you don't have enough hydrochloric acid in your
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=144s)** — stomach to break down the protein, then you end up with undigested protein that enters the small
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=150s)** — intestine. And so you might get cramping and extra work by the pancreas to pump out more
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=156s)** — enzymes. One thing that humans cannot digest is fiber. A lot of the microbes that you have
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=162s)** — in the body act on this fiber. And ideally, a lot of that fiber is going to be broken down
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=168s)** — so then we have the actual stool or the residue that's left over. So the stool is composed of
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=174s)** — about 75% water, 25% bacteria, and then some dead cells. Now my digestive system was never
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=184s)** — worse than when I went on a vegan diet and I had beans, fruits, I had whole grains,
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=193s)** — I was doing soy. Oh my goodness, did my stomach get bloated and crampy and I was so uncomfortable.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=203s)** — You have to have a super healthy digestive system to be able to be a vegan. Because if
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=209s)** — you have leaky gut, these are really going to irritate the already existing inflammatory
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=213s)** — surface area of your intestine. And this is why some people do so well on the carnivore diet
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=219s)** — because you eliminate all this fiber, we're getting more meat which has a lot of glutamine
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=224s)** — which actually can heal the intestine. So let's talk about the three steps that you should do
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=229s)** — to solve this problem. Okay, number one would be something called intermittent fasting. They
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=235s)** — should bring down their consumption of food to two meals a day, one for lunch, one at dinner,
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=240s)** — and eat nothing in between with those meals. That will at least give your system a chance to
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=246s)** — catch up and have a break. Okay, step number two. This is where we're going to fix the diet.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=253s)** — The more complex your meals are with all these different ingredients, the more chance for more
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=259s)** — stress on the digestive system. Maybe you start off with some meat and maybe two cups of
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=264s)** — vegetables or salad which would be better, easier to digest than like broccoli, things like
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=271s)** — unless the broccoli is cooked or steamed. Now one really good vegetable would be sauerkraut,
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=277s)** — which is really good for healing a leaky gut. So you don't want to get your fiber from
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=283s)** — grain synthetically created. We want to give your microbes things that they recognize and
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=289s)** — they're used to digesting. Things like polyphenols to actually feed the microbes. But
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=294s)** — when you're dealing with the fiber from corn fiber, you're not getting these polyphenols.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=298s)** — Another really really important thing to avoid is seed oils,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=303s)** — soy, corn, canola, because these things have been severely refined. So change your diet and
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=310s)** — the diet I'm going to recommend is the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. And I'm going to
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=314s)** — put a link down below but you're going to tweak it by not consuming a massive amount of
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=320s)** — greens or salad. You can have just a small amount and probably cooked or fermented,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=324s)** — at least initially. All right, the third step, betaine hydrochloride to build up your
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=330s)** — hydrochloric acid in your stomach. So how do you know if you need hydrochloric acid? Well,
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=334s)** — constipation is one symptom of a lack of bile. Then you need betaine hydrochloride.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=339s)** — So you would take like five of those little tablets before you eat. That alone could get
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=344s)** — rid of your constipation because bile helps lubricate the colon. And then we get to
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=351s)** — probiotics. Okay. But realize that if you just get your diet corrected, you may not need
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=357s)** — probiotics. Now, another very interesting thing about your foods, when you consume plants
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=364s)** — that are raised on healthy soils, that plant is loaded with microbes. I mean, this is how
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=371s)** — cows, for example, populate their colons by consuming the grass that has the microbes from
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=377s)** — soil. Another really good thing for you to use is magnesium and more than just like the normal
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=385s)** — RDAs, which could come out to like 800 milligrams or even a little bit more. The other nutrient
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=390s)** — deficiency that is common in constipation is vitamin B1, which is if you've been consuming
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=395s)** — a lot of refined carbohydrates or sugars. And so you want to start taking a good vitamin B1.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=402s)** — So you can then help stimulate the pumping action of the colon. This is where you might
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=407s)** — want to add some castor oil or senna, which is a really common natural herbal laxative that has
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=416s)** — very minimal side effects, if any, especially if you compare that to drugs. So these three
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=422s)** — steps should handle most constipation problems. There is always exceptions to the rules and
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=429s)** — there's other things to take. But for right now, I think the most important thing is to
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=433s)** — start with step one, which is intermittent fasting. So if you have not seen this video,
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sBFSidJcg0&t=438s)** — check it out on intermittent fasting.
