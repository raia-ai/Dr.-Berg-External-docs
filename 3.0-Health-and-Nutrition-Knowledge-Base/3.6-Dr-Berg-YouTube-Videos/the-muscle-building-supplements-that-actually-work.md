- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=0s)** — The three best supplements to build muscle as fast as possible.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=5s)** — Of course, everyone knows that exercise is the most potent stimulus of building muscle.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=10s)** — The more mechanical stress on the muscles, the faster the muscle responds by getting bigger.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=15s)** — What I want to get into is what supplements can you take at the same time to enhance that effect?
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=20s)** — And some other things that are really important to talk about too, because they can slow you down,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=25s)** — if not prevent you from growing your muscles.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=28s)** — One of them does stimulate muscle growth, but when you're just taking three amino acids,
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=32s)** — it's just a very incomplete product. Because you need more than just three amino acids to actually build muscle.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=38s)** — And in fact, on some of the double-blended studies that were done on amino acids, the results are not good.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=44s)** — It really doesn't do anything for your muscles. So that's going to be a waste of time.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=48s)** — Not to mention, it'll turn into sugar. It'll actually increase your blood sugar many times as well.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=53s)** — The other thing I'm going to recommend to avoid if you're trying to build muscle is something called tribulus and fenugreek.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=59s)** — Both of those do tend to increase testosterone a little bit, but not enough to really see any change in your muscles.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=66s)** — And as we age, testosterone goes down. Testosterone is essential to building muscle.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=72s)** — And also our cortisol goes up as we age. And so the combination of low testosterone and increased cortisol is not good for your muscles.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=79s)** — One of the biggest things that will do that is overtraining.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=82s)** — When you overtrain, you greatly spike cortisol and you shut down your testosterone. That's directly going to affect your muscles.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=88s)** — And testosterone actually comes from cholesterol. I don't recommend you go on a low-fat diet or a low-cholesterol diet,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=95s)** — let alone take this medication called statins because statins block cholesterol, which will tank your testosterone and prevent you from developing your muscles.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=105s)** — Another big barrier in developing muscles is having insulin resistance.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=110s)** — And that comes from usually consuming way too much carbohydrates as well as eating frequently with all the different snacks.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=116s)** — And a lack of sleep is a huge factor in developing your muscles.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=120s)** — Since most of the muscle growth occurs when you're sleeping, if you're not sleeping, that could be a big barrier.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=126s)** — One of the best things to help you sleep is magnesium glycinate.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=130s)** — Magnesium is essential in making energy that actually feeds the muscle.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=134s)** — So magnesium is a really important nutrient. But that's not part of the three supplements I'm going to recommend. It's just a side note.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=141s)** — The first supplement I'm going to recommend is something called creatine monohydrate.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=145s)** — Creatine is normally in red meat. Creatine increases ATP, it increases performance, it increases your energy while you're working out,
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=154s)** — more hydration, as well as increasing muscle stimulus directly, increasing the mass or the size of the muscle.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=160s)** — That's number one supplement. Number two, whey protein.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=163s)** — Because whey protein powder per scoop gives you enough leucine to stimulate muscle growth.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=171s)** — And when you have whey protein, you'll get enough leucine as well as all of the amino acids that you need to develop muscle.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=180s)** — If you're going to take whey protein powder, I would just take it once a day.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=183s)** — And number three supplement is zinc. Because zinc increases testosterone.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=189s)** — Even if you're mildly deficient in zinc, you will have less production of testosterone.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=195s)** — Testosterone is very, very important in developing muscle size and strength.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=200s)** — And like I said before, as we get older, when our testosterone goes down, we just cannot develop muscle like we used to.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=207s)** — Now, let me shift gears to the food that you should eat.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=210s)** — Now, if we're trying to build muscle, we want to eat muscle.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=213s)** — Okay. And the best muscle to eat is grass-fed red meat. Why?
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=217s)** — Because grass-fed red meat has high levels of creatine.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=223s)** — It also has all of the amino acids, including leucine.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=226s)** — And it also has zinc, MB12, and carnosine, which is another thing that can help you.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=233s)** — And if that red meat also has fat in it, that can give you the cholesterol, the building block to help build testosterone because you need the cholesterol.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=240s)** — Now, you can also do eggs. Eggs are great too. And fish, salmon.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=243s)** — But out of all of the proteins and foods you can eat to build muscle, red meat is going to be at the top of the list.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=251s)** — And now you know why. There's a couple last interesting points I want to mention.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=255s)** — We talked about overtraining, right? That's the worst killer for trying to develop muscle because you're not going to develop muscle.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=260s)** — You're going to spike cortisol and you're going to reduce testosterone.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=264s)** — It's going to affect your cognitive function and it's going to increase your appetite.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=267s)** — It's going to cause you to eat the wrong foods.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=269s)** — There's also a protein called myostatin that inhibits your muscle growth.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=276s)** — You have this protein that kind of keeps you from growing muscles too big.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=280s)** — And it just so happens that when you do heavy training, resistant exercise training, you inhibit that protein.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=286s)** — And creatine also decreases that protein as well. And vitamin D also can decrease that protein.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=294s)** — So you want to get a lot of sun on top of what I just told you.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=297s)** — So I hope this data will help you.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDzypsisI4&t=299s)** — Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.
