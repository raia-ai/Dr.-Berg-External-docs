- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=0s)** — Okay, so this is what you're going to do about insulin resistance to correct it.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=4s)** — So if you have a dysfunction with insulin, you have to understand what triggers insulin, okay?
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=10s)** — And what will trigger it is consuming sugar, or
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=14s)** — hidden sugars, or
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=16s)** — artificial sweeteners, or
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=18s)** — foods with MSG from going out to the fast food places.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=24s)** — Okay, those are all things that trigger it, but there's one additional important thing. This is very very important.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=29s)** — So I need your attention right here.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=32s)** — It's eating in general will trigger insulin, okay? So that means that all the snacking is
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=38s)** — really bad because it spikes insulin. If we can keep insulin low, you can actually heal insulin.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=46s)** — So if we do breakfast, lunch, and dinner with no snacks in between or at night,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=52s)** — we can heal insulin resistance.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=54s)** — If you really are serious about losing weight, and you want to take it one step further,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=58s)** — over a period of time when you get used to this, and you can do it, you can go to two meals a day.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=62s)** — Unless you're a hardcore workout person, and you're going to need a little bit more food, but most people can actually do a later
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=71s)** — breakfast and
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=72s)** — maybe a dinner later on, you know, so it's spaced out with no snacks in between.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=78s)** — But here's the secret. You need to add
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=80s)** — some fat at the meal to allow you to be satisfied to the point where you can go from one meal to the next
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=85s)** — without being terribly, terribly hungry. We're not talking about cutting calories. We're talking about cutting the frequency of
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=94s)** — eating. This is the most important thing.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=96s)** — I think most people eat out of a habit, out of social reasons. They go to dinner or at night
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=103s)** — they're watching TV and they're bored and they start eating. That's the biggest thing you're going to have to overcome
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=107s)** — out of boredom. So you got to stop snacking.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=111s)** — Lots of potassium foods. Potassium decreases the need for insulin.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=115s)** — The B vitamins decrease the need for insulin.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=119s)** — Chromium decreases the need for insulin.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=125s)** — So all those minerals
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=127s)** — are really, really good. So how do you get your potassium? From big salads, large salads or vegetables.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=133s)** — So you can do a kale shake with beet tops and kale and blend it up. It's a great...
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=138s)** — I have videos on that. So that will actually help
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=142s)** — insulin. Three to six ounces of protein with each meal. Don't have a lot of protein because that will mess you up.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=149s)** — Just a moderate amount. Okay? High quality protein. And increase the fat.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=155s)** — Do not do this program without
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=158s)** — adding fat because if you do lean proteins, you could spike insulin more than if you just had a fattier protein.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=165s)** — I'm talking about healthy fats. Like even
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=169s)** — grass-fed beef is a healthy fat.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=173s)** — Even bacon without sugar, believe it or not, is a... it's healthier than a lot of the chicken that people eat.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=178s)** — You can do avocados. You can do coconut. You can do brie cheese. You can do nuts.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=183s)** — You can do nut butters. All those are really good fats to help you go from one meal to the next. And of course you want to avoid
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=191s)** — sugar. Okay? Avoid sugar. That's what you want to do because
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=196s)** — you will not be able to fix insulin resistance unless you avoid sugar.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=201s)** — But you're going to see if you're a pre-diabetic or a diabetic and you have this condition,
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=206s)** — these are the tools to help you. Now I do have a new
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=211s)** — supplement that actually is really really beneficial for insulin resistance.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=217s)** — So you can click the link down below and check it out. But in this supplement, I have every
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=223s)** — high-powered superfood to support a healthy insulin and glucose
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=229s)** — system. So you can check it out and I go through the ingredients and I explain that.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=234s)** — But if you were to take that, it would definitely support
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qLdSKDkEE&t=237s)** — healthy blood sugars. Okay? Thanks for watching and I hope you enjoy the course.
