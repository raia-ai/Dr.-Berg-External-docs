- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=31s)** — And so he was also a wrestler. So we have definitely have something in common.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=35s)** — He wrestled heavyweight and I think two time national championship, right?
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=39s)** — Yes.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=40s)** — Wow. Well done.

- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=44s)** — So, Jim, tell me a little bit about... did you always have... since you were a heavyweight, I'm guessing you've been big for a while, right?
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=52s)** — Or you've been overweight? I don't know, you tell me.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=55s)** — Yeah, I was always on the heavy side. You know, always chunky, I guess.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=60s)** — Wrestling was a good outlet for me to get in shape. Wrestling and football and sports, I always kind of got in better shape when I was participating in that stuff.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=71s)** — And then I'd always kind of fall off when the season was over. And it was always a struggle.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=76s)** — So you're going along for how many years before you said, you know, I just need I need to lose this weight?
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=83s)** — I was gradually getting higher and higher at one point reached 395. And I was sitting with one of my friends and I said, hey, five more pounds and I'm in the 400 club.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=93s)** — And he said, what are you doing? You're crazy. Stop it. So that kind of dropped me, you know, down to I think I got down to 360 and stayed there probably for the last five years.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=105s)** — I was probably in the 350, 360 range. At that point, did you have any other health problems?
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=111s)** — Yeah, I had a lot of health problems. I was hospitalized a couple of times with cellulitis in my legs.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=119s)** — It was kind of I was always kind of sickly and you don't realize it at the time.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=124s)** — But you just think it's normal, you know, that that you occasionally get ill.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=128s)** — And I did that. And I and then and you just feel like this is kind of the end, you know, you're gradually get older and then you'll just get sick and die.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=139s)** — And hopefully you can make it as long as possible. So it's something you kind of got used to.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=144s)** — I mean, especially like being that heavy. I mean, I would imagine you probably get used to it.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=148s)** — But I mean, just the weight of like close to 400 pounds on your joints, on your knees and your back. I can't imagine.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=153s)** — But you probably just adapted to it. Yeah, it just seemed I think everybody got comfortable with it.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=158s)** — My family, me. Yeah, I just thought it was I would just stay.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=165s)** — Medicated and and, you know, just keep going that way, you know, was there something that when you started to figure out keto, what what how do you run into keto?
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=180s)** — Well, I always knew that, you know, whenever I would shift to a high protein diet, I would.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=189s)** — I lose weight, you know, I was just kind of something clicked and I knew how to do it.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=194s)** — You know, I knew that if I cut out, you know, processed foods and then carbs, I would lose weight.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=201s)** — But what happened was I went to a wrestling meet up at Parkside and I seen their heavyweight get beat and I thought, you know what?
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=208s)** — I'm going to go. I can help this kid. I'm going to go in the room and help them.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=211s)** — So I went into the room and realized I can't move anymore like I used to.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=217s)** — You know, I I can't help this kid.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=220s)** — So I thought, you know what? You need to start start working out, start eating right.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=225s)** — And I really shifted towards as much protein as possible and really cut out.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=237s)** — You know, every every carb I could think of, you know, and I.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=246s)** — And then the weight, this is February of this year that this started and it just fell off me like.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=253s)** — You know, it just it was amazing and I and I did work out throughout the process, but it wasn't like it was crazy workouts.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=260s)** — You know, I was maybe twice a week up at the wrestling room, you know, getting on the bike, slowly getting back into I knew how to work out because I've done it, you know, pretty much my whole life.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=272s)** — And. But this there was something different. And when I really.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=278s)** — Kind of pushed out the processed foods and sugars that.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=283s)** — It just changed my life, you know, it really did. So you went from how much weight to your current weight now, but tell me how much what you went from to currently.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=292s)** — I was in February. I was probably in mid three sixties, maybe three sixty five and I right now I'm two fifty five.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=301s)** — So it's 100 plus and that's that short amount of time, which was is really it's crazy that it happened that fast.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=311s)** — And, you know, I follow kind of the three like I follow carnivore.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=319s)** — Diet, but it's almost impossible to stay that, you know, that.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=326s)** — Regimented so, but I really don't eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, you know, I think I get I mean I multi vitamins is kind of where I'm getting, you know, and and from your advice.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=341s)** — Organ meat is where I get a lot of my my vitamins, but I mean, I don't eat any pasta, any sugar and I.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=351s)** — I just think. Yeah, I just think I agree. It's crazy what happened to me in this short amount of time.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=358s)** — It was it's been it's been amazing. It's life changing.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=361s)** — You know, and it's been so many different aspects that that have happened to me.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=366s)** — It's different positive things, you know, one thing that did happen.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=371s)** — I did have I had a seizure because.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=375s)** — I wasn't used to not holding the water that I had, so I went to my daughter's softball tournament and spent the whole day.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=385s)** — I had some coffee in the morning. I'm kind of nervous when I watch her pitch.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=388s)** — So I I didn't drink any water throughout the day.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=393s)** — I got home and I went to bed and I had a seizure and I ended up in the hospital and it kind of broke it down.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=399s)** — The neurologist and everybody that it was heat stroke and dehydration and maybe a salt deficiency that kind of caused this thing.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=407s)** — So, I mean, that's kind of a warning to other people.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=411s)** — If they go through this to really keep an eye on, you know, their electrolyte intake, which I which I do.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=420s)** — You know, so. Yeah, I'll just mention one point for those of you that are watching.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=426s)** — What happens when you when you start this, when you cut out carbs, you lose all tremendous amount of water weight.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=431s)** — And with that comes electrolyte loss. So if you don't, especially potassium, too.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=436s)** — So if you don't add either electrolytes and sea salt, you're going to end up pretty dehydrated.
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=443s)** — So that's just a really important little factor. I'm glad that you you figure that out.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=447s)** — But yeah, that's amazing. So, Jim, when you do the carnivore, of course, you can get all your nutrients.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=452s)** — You just have to know what to do. So you're adding probably beef liver, organ meats, eggs, fish,
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=460s)** — the omega three fatty acids, probably, and also shellfish for all the trace minerals.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=466s)** — And you can even get some vitamin C from liver as well. And you've been doing that, right?
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=471s)** — I mean, you're like, because so many people just do the steak, which is it's not going to give you everything, a lot of things, but not everything.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=479s)** — Yeah, I eat a lot of chicken liver. I eat a lot of beef liver.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=484s)** — We blend up the liver and add it to the to the beef, make hamburgers with it, kind of takes that that funk away from the taste a little bit.
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=494s)** — Yeah, salt. No seasonings really except salt. I use sea salt.
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=503s)** — I do go, like I said, if I in the morning, I'll drink a protein shake, carnivore protein shake.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=514s)** — A premiere protein bar. If, you know, if I try not to get hungry, I try not if I'm I always keep something with me just so I'm not ever really tempted.
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=527s)** — These days, I'm not. It's weird how I like Fourth of July, I stood in the tent where all the food was and just looked around at everything.
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=534s)** — And I was thinking, why don't I want this food anymore? Wow.
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=537s)** — And I grabbed a brat and ate a brat. And yeah, it's really has I because the way I feel just outweighs that that need.
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=550s)** — Yeah, you know, that's that's that's with me too. When I get to the point where I'm like, you know what, I already know what I'm going to feel like if I go this other direction.
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=557s)** — It's like, no, it's not worth it, because I'm sure people around you are not doing what you're doing.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=562s)** — And then and they're they're probably looking at you kind of weird. But you're like, no, I'm good. I'm good.
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=566s)** — I did get it. I think I got it for a month from my wife until she started seeing what was happening to me.
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=573s)** — And now she's probably about 90 percent on board. You know, she eats what I eat.
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=580s)** — And I seen her eat an onion ring the other day. But she's she's had miraculous with her skin, you know, and and it's just those little byproducts of this diet that are just amazing.
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=592s)** — I feel like my hair is coming back on top of my head. You know, it's the weirdest, you know, skin tags gone.
- **[10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=601s)** — Wow. And it's and I see people that I've known for 20 years and I walk by them and they double take, you know, because they don't recognize me.
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=611s)** — I mean, you have those before and after pictures. It's a different a different person.
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=616s)** — And so then the people I talked to and I explained today, I was at the gym and I was talking to a guy and I mean, the results that have happened, you just can't deny what has happened to me.
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=629s)** — So they there's a lot of people on board, you know, and I and I appreciate the info I get from you.
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=636s)** — And there's several doctors that I kind of pull stuff from and, you know, Barry, Dr. Barry, I pull some stuff from and Dr. Chafee, he's kind of an extremist.
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=648s)** — But I think you've all kind of done this for me. And thank you for that.
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=655s)** — Hey, you're welcome. My pleasure. That's that's why I do it. It's really it's a lot of enjoyment just to get people just to at least try it to see that they can do it.
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=664s)** — And that's why I wanted to create this video to inspire the people who are sitting there haven't done it yet.
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=669s)** — You might want to, you know, try it out. And because, you know, it's not it's there's like thousands and thousands of people that we have on the website to just before and afters.
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=679s)** — But, you know, what you did is you just cut out the carbs. That's the that's the most important thing is cutting out carbs.
- **[11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=687s)** — And then you substituted the protein and the fat. And then once you started feeling the difference, then no one can convince you otherwise.
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=696s)** — I mean, you probably also have how about your energy or even your cognitive function?
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=703s)** — I drive when I'm driving through Kenosha, sometimes I look at a house and I realize I got babysat there when I was seven.
- **[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=711s)** — That's the kind of weird stuff is happening with my brain and energy.
- **[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=717s)** — These people say you're working out a ton, right? I said, I'm not working out a ton, but I cannot not work out.
- **[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=723s)** — I got to be doing something because of the energy level is so high.
- **[12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=726s)** — You know, I probably rode my bike to the four miles to the gym today, four miles back.
- **[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=732s)** — I lifted, but it's not crazy. I'm not, you know, maybe it was half hour, 45 minute workout and then came back because otherwise that gives me the best.
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=746s)** — If I if I get rid of this energy, I sleep better.
- **[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=748s)** — And it's really doesn't feel restrictive, the diet, because there's such a, you know, people ask me, what you eat?
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=754s)** — And I said anything that any animal, if it comes from an animal to eat cheese still, I drink milk.
- **[12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=761s)** — And it's the ultimate elimination diet, because, you know, milk makes my shoulders a little sore, a little bit of inflammation, I think, from the sugar in the milk.
- **[12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=770s)** — But I know what it does to me. And that's kind of what what's happened.
- **[12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=775s)** — I know, you know, I know what everything how everything affects me.
- **[12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=779s)** — Yeah, you're in tune to the food and you can, you know, it's almost good sometimes they go off just so you could really see for sure like, OK, yeah, that that's going to create some inflammation.
- **[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=789s)** — No, thank you. You know, and when I wrestled, unfortunately, I was I had always cut weight.
- **[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=794s)** — You probably didn't have to worry about that. But cutting a lot of weight, if I only would have known what I know now, I mean, back then, have been incredible because I was trying to live on carbs.
- **[13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=806s)** — And lose weight by just not just starving for like three days. Right.
- **[13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=811s)** — The worst, worst for your energy. And so not not that someone wants to do.
- **[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=819s)** — You know, if you're an athlete, you know, you're going to have to eat a lot more calories or else you're going to get really lean.
- **[13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=826s)** — So and actually probably more fat, too. But but yeah, so this is amazing.
- **[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=831s)** — So also, what about like your your your exercise?
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=835s)** — And I don't know if you're still wrestling now or coaching or working with people.
- **[13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=839s)** — What about your physical strength or agility and endurance?
- **[14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=846s)** — It's it is through the roof. It's the muscle mass at this age to be putting on, you know, and abs.
- **[14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=855s)** — I didn't have I've never had abs before.

- **[15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=937s)** — So I had a couple of guys at my weight class in the early 30s.
- **[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=941s)** — And then I wrestled in an old timers tournament in Franklin.
- **[15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=946s)** — And those guys were a little younger.
- **[15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=949s)** — But I feel like, yeah, it's just.
- **[15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=953s)** — And I can't wait to do it again.
- **[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=955s)** — And, I mean, my knees feel better than they probably ever have.
- **[15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=959s)** — You know, I just I don't have any inflammation is what it is.

- **[16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=976s)** — You do that for so long and all of a sudden, like, OK, you stop and you have you want to keep doing it because it's like it's a game.
- **[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=983s)** — But unfortunately, there's not much around in southern Virginia.
- **[16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=987s)** — But yeah, that would be interesting because I'm about one hundred eighty seven.
- **[16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=993s)** — So I guess I'd have to maybe lose a couple pounds for the one eighty.
- **[16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1000s)** — Yeah, there's probably something down there you could find.
- **[16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1002s)** — I think there's something I'm going to have to check it out.
- **[16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1005s)** — I have some serious endurance because I live on a farm and I'm talking about hills.
- **[16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1009s)** — I think I mean, I know even people that come here that are a lot younger.
- **[16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1013s)** — They can't keep up because of the environment, you know, the high altitude, the work around the farm.
- **[17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1020s)** — It's like I'm in better shape now than I was 20 years ago.

- **[17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1026s)** — When people say that in the past, I wouldn't believe it, you know, but I believe it now.
- **[17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1031s)** — I find it hard to lose my wind.

- **[17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1045s)** — You know how? Yeah, how I how I improve more, you know, literally have gotten younger as you're getting older.
- **[17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1054s)** — So as far as advice, if you were just to give someone some advice and they're sitting on the edge thinking, you know what?
- **[17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1061s)** — I need to do this. But I what tip when you give them more advice to motivate them?
- **[17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1068s)** — It's not as hard as it's not as hard as you think.
- **[17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1071s)** — And I think a lot of people think especially if they're obese, because I feel like I was obese when you put up that picture.
- **[17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1078s)** — I was obese.
- **[18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1081s)** — You think it's going to take two years.
- **[18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1083s)** — It's the thing it's going to take. I haven't got two years to I can't do this for two years, but it don't.
- **[18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1088s)** — And the other thing is you have such a large range of food you can eat from the chicken and and you don't bypass.
- **[18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1096s)** — You know, in my brain, it's not the animal fats that are clogging arteries.
- **[18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1100s)** — My mom died at 56 in her sleep from a clogged heart.
- **[18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1105s)** — And it's in her mom, the same thing.

- **[18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1113s)** — And I don't I don't feel like it's animal fats that are clogging the hearts.
- **[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1118s)** — It's it's that gluten in the animal in the starch mixed together.
- **[18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1123s)** — So now in my brain is I know if I start adding that back into my diet, I feel like it's just going to stop everything up again.
- **[18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1130s)** — So that's kind of but you got to look at it the big range of food you can eat.
- **[18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1136s)** — And I mean, if you look at I know I get some I get some plant based stuff from my from my bars and stuff that I'll eat.
- **[19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1143s)** — And I think that's kind of the key to I talk to people.

- **[19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1169s)** — I did a juice fast one time for 30 days and I sure I lost like 60 pounds, but I was awfully weak.
- **[19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1177s)** — And.
- **[19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1179s)** — I didn't feel like I feel now, you know, and then soon as soon as it was over, it was.
- **[19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1185s)** — That bloomed up again right away.
- **[19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1188s)** — You can't do it for any period of time.
- **[19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1189s)** — Right. This you can live on.
- **[19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1191s)** — And if you and people say, well, I can't eat a I can't eat steak with your salt on it.

- **[20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1203s)** — Do whatever you can to stick with it.
- **[20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1206s)** — You know, if it takes some vanilla yogurt at night and with a little bit of sugar in it, do it.
- **[20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1213s)** — You know, that's going to keep you on track because that's what I do once in a while.

- **[20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1224s)** — But I think it's easier than you think.
- **[20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1226s)** — And the way I tell them, I tell the people that question me and I could tell they're on the fence.
- **[20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1232s)** — I say do it 10 days, you know, do it for 10 days, cut out all your carbs and sugars and don't eat anything that grows for 10 days.
- **[20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQvuJhWzOc&t=1241s)** — That's what I say. Try that.
