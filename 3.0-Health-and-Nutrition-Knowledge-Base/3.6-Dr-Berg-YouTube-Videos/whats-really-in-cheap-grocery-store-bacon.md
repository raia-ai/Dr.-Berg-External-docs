- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=0s)** — Is expensive bacon really worth it? It's really confusing when you're shopping at the store for
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=4s)** — bacon because there's all these different types, all these different price points from $3.39 to $5
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=9s)** — to $9 to $12. Or even in some cases, would you ever spend $283 for a pound of bacon? Well,
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=18s)** — maybe you would if you understood the bacon from the pigs that I actually raised on my
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=24s)** — amazing farm, which I'll get into the details a little bit later. When we're talking about the
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=28s)** — quality of bacon, we have this commodity, extremely cheap bacon. This is what's in most of the grocery
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=32s)** — stores. Yes, you have a little bit of protein. You have a lot of fat. When a pig is born and
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=37s)** — weaned off its mother, it's about 40 to 50 pounds, then sent to the feedlot. This new
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=42s)** — home that this pig is going to live in has a square footage of about 7 to 7.2 square feet.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=49s)** — That is the square footage of an average bathtub. It's kind of like you living in a
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=56s)** — closet. Now they're going to increase the weight of that pig to 250 to 300 pounds in 3 to 4
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=68s)** — months. Then the question is, what are they feeding this poor animal? 30% of the feed is
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=74s)** — dent corn, which is GMO. That means it's genetically modified and it has traces of
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=80s)** — Of course, the other 70% is basically genetically modified corn and soy. Also things like
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=87s)** — ractopamine. This is a drug that is banned in 90 other countries. And this is a way to ramp up
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=95s)** — the muscle on this animal in the last 20 days of its life. And what's really fascinating about
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=100s)** — these factory farms is that they have certain agricultural gag laws. There's laws against
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=106s)** — can't really reveal what's happening inside some of these farms. Very few people know that that
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=112s)** — bacon that they buy at the store for $3.33 comes from these factory farms. They don't really
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=118s)** — think about it. They don't really know about it. I don't want to support that. I want to
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=121s)** — support the small farmer that's really doing it right. That really cares about the animal's
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=126s)** — welfare. Now let's talk about the processing of bacon. There's always a smoke flavor with
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=130s)** — you might think that they're going to roast this pork. But now they're actually going to
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=135s)** — add liquid smoke or they add this smoke flavoring to the pork. They add some salt water and
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=141s)** — sometimes sugar and MSG slice it up and take it to the grocery store. Let's contrast that
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=147s)** — with pasture raised bacon. A really good example of a farmer that does it right. His
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=151s)** — name is John Arbuckle. John's farm is called Singing Pastures. And I'm going to put a
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=159s)** — stick on the top of the chart. It takes a lot of work to do that. I've talked to him many
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=163s)** — times on the phone. I've gotten pictures of his farm and he'll put 20 pigs on an acre of land
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=170s)** — but then he rotates them to allow the grass to regenerate. We have a really good supportive
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=176s)** — system with the environment. The super healthy microbes that actually grow and support
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=182s)** — the plant and give the pig a much better nutrition profile. Plus they're out in the
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=187s)** — sun so they get a lot more vitamin D. The biggest thing is they get exercise freedom to walk around
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=192s)** — and navigate through the environment. Then you have these farms in Spain and Italy where these
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=197s)** — pigs live on acorns. These acorns are one of the best foods for pigs. In Europe they will
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=205s)** — cure their ham, ferment and enhance the flavor and the quality of the meat. And that
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=210s)** — curing process could last like 36 months. Now let me shift gears to my little farm operation
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=216s)** — I'm not selling food on my farm. It's just a hobby. I'm like a farmer wannabe. I'm actually
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=223s)** — not very skilled at it. I'm just learning how to do it because it's an interesting
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=227s)** — hobby for me. I have some pigs and I'm only talking about five pigs but those five pigs live
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=232s)** — on five acres. They get to run around and there's no antibiotics at all. The type of
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=237s)** — grains that I use are the best grains possible. It's organic. There's no soy. There's no corn.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=243s)** — This grain is super expensive. $1,500 per thousand pounds of feed. I calculated the cost
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=251s)** — of one of my pigs and I was shocked because it was literally around $49,000. Because this
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=258s)** — is over a course of several years. I'm just feeding them and getting to the point where
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=262s)** — they're literally like 600 or 700 pounds. If I were to sell one pound of bacon from my pork
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=269s)** — without even making any profit, my cost is $283.33 per pound. No one in the right mind
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=277s)** — would spend that amount. I do not know how a small farmer can afford to raise pigs. This is
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=283s)** — why it's important to support the small farmer especially at the farmers market and
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=288s)** — other places online. And personally my opinion is it's much better for your health. I want to
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=292s)** — shift gears to nitrates. Nitrates are a chemical to act as an antibacterial and even
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=298s)** — enhance the taste a little bit. One of the problems with nitrates is when you add high
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=302s)** — heats, you can turn the nitrates into another form of nitrates which are cancer causing.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=307s)** — There's a big difference between synthetic nitrates and the naturally occurring nitrates
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=312s)** — that are in certain vegetables like celery. When pork is smoked and you're allowing this to
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=317s)** — naturally occur with smoke, it actually adds a benefit to that pork. Pork has some of the
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=328s)** — trace minerals like selenium and zinc. Pork can be very nutrient dense. Over 50% of the fat
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=335s)** — in pork, I'm talking about lard fat, is a healthy thing. We used to cook with lard long ago. If
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=341s)** — that pork is raised in the right environment, you can use that lard in cooking and different
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=346s)** — recipes. Let me shift to the mistakes people make when they're cooking pork. The more
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=351s)** — overcooked that the meat is, the more the byproducts can be a carcinogen. It's very
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=356s)** — important when you're frying this bacon not to overdo it. One way is baking. Bake your bacon
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=362s)** — in the oven. Another way to do it is in an air fryer. Also, if you're frying bacon, if you
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=367s)** — add a little bit of water to the pan, it can help to reduce the overcooking and the burning
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=372s)** — effect. Another thing, if you're frying bacon, you can add a little bit of olive oil to
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=377s)** — the bottom part. You're adding more antioxidants from this extra virgin olive oil. Some other
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=383s)** — to reduce some of the carcinogenic effect from frying bacon. You can actually add garlic and
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=390s)** — onions when you're frying the bacon. It can neutralize those carcinogens. The other thing
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=395s)** — is that when you have bacon, what are you eating with the bacon? A cheeseburger with a
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=399s)** — bun and eating with fries and stuff. That's really bad. If you eat your bacon on a salad
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=404s)** — or with other things, at the same time, you can add some antioxidants to counter the effect
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=409s)** — these nitrates that I talked about. What about microwaving bacon? I am very much against that.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=415s)** — It produces this nasty chemical reaction. In fact, I'm leery about cooking any meats
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=419s)** — in a microwave. So in summary, definitely upgrade your bacon towards a more pasture-raised
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=426s)** — pork. And that way you can actually have a nutrient-dense food. Now that you know the
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=431s)** — truth about bacon, we now need to talk about eggs. Sense of the perfect combination and all
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=436s)** — the reasons why you need to be consuming more eggs on a regular basis. Out of all the important
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8yLdf5meY&t=442s)** — videos that I've done about food, this one is at the top of the list and you're going to
