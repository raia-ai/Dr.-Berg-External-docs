- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=0s)** — Which one of these would you buy? The $2 per dozen version or the $7 a dozen version? Well,
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=8s)** — I have an excellent presentation for you because I am an egg-spert at this topic. Of course, it's not
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=16s)** — an exact science, but I want to share with you some data on eggs that I think will help you
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=22s)** — choose the right type of egg. So when evaluating eggs, there's a lot of these different terms
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=27s)** — that are confusing. I'm going to make it extremely simple. The first part of this is just going to be
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=31s)** — mainly talking about space. How much space the chicken gets. Okay. Unfortunately, 65% of all
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=39s)** — chickens are in cages. Caged chickens, which is the great majority of all the chickens, are
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=46s)** — required to get at least 67 square inches. So that's a little bit over 8 inches by 8 inches
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=54s)** — of space. Then you get something else called New California Caged Chickens. They get another
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=60s)** — couple inches. So that's like a space of 10 and a half inches by 10 and a half inches.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=64s)** — And again, not even a square foot of space. Then you graduate into something called cage-free.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=70s)** — Right? They're out of the cage. But the question is, how much space do they usually get?
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=75s)** — They're in a barn with a lot of other chickens. Cage-free chickens get 12 inches by
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=80s)** — 12 inches. So they get a square foot. Then we get something called free range or something
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=85s)** — called free roaming. So they get to go around the barn and they get actually two feet by two
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=91s)** — feet. So it's 24 inches by 24 inches. A little more space. And I think they're also allowed to
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=98s)** — go outside the barn. There's some hole outside the barn. I don't know when they have access
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=102s)** — to that. I think when they're laying. And I also don't know if they have the option of
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=106s)** — stepping on actual grass or just cement. Then we get something called pasture-raised.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=110s)** — Not pasteurized. These chickens get a little bit more than 10 feet by 10 feet. So that's
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=115s)** — a lot better. Now, if you could find a farmer close to you, maybe at the farmer's market,
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=121s)** — they're going to probably get a lot more space. I think that's the chickens that you
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=124s)** — really want to get their eggs from. Because when we're dealing with space,
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=128s)** — as you collapse the space in on these chickens, you raise up cortisol, adrenaline.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=135s)** — It's not healthy. It's not going to contribute to the health of that chicken or the health of the
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=140s)** — egg. Chickens were not designed to live without space. Just like you're not designed to live
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=146s)** — in a small area of space. Now, when somebody says natural, right? These eggs are fresh and
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=153s)** — natural. That does not mean anything. You can pretty much ignore that. And also ignore the
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=159s)** — different grades. It doesn't tell you how healthy that chicken is either. What you want
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=163s)** — is pasture raised. Now, as far as the feed goes, you have conventional feeds. Sometimes they'll say
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=172s)** — it's vegetarian feed versus what else are you going to feed them? Chicken. Conventional
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=178s)** — chickens are fed corn and soy. GMO. That means they're sprayed with chemicals. And
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=184s)** — that also means that they're getting a tremendous amount of omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=188s)** — An average egg is not low in this omega-6 fatty acid. Now, you have this ratio. You have the
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=195s)** — ratios of omega-3 fats to omega-6 fatty acids. And sometimes companies will spike the omega-3
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=203s)** — by adding fish feed or fish meal and things like that. And that's fine. But at the same
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=209s)** — time, they don't lower the omega-6 fatty acids. Now, why is it so important to not
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=214s)** — so much omega-6 fatty acid? Because at least between 25% and 30% of our overall calories
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=223s)** — in the U.S. is omega-6 seed oils. So adding more omega-6 is not a good thing. These foods
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=232s)** — high in omega-6 fatty acids really mess with your mitochondria, your energy factory. They
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=237s)** — leach into the nervous system. They affect the heart. They create inflammation. Now,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=242s)** — I personally raise chickens for their eggs. And we get a lot of eggs from those chickens. I mean,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=247s)** — we probably get maybe nine eggs a day. We can't even eat that much. In nature, these chickens
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=253s)** — are meant to consume worms, bugs, things like that. And if you're raising chickens,
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=258s)** — it's very difficult to have enough worms or bugs for them. So what I was using is an organic
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=263s)** — grain mix for quite some time until I had my eggs tested. And I was kind of shocked to
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=270s)** — find out that the eggs were pretty high in omega-6 fatty acids. So what did I do? I found a type
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=277s)** — of feed that's still organic, but it's no soy, no corn, organic peas, organic barley, oats,
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=285s)** — wheat, fish mail, calcium, vitamins, minerals. And then I also enhance it with some freeze-dried
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=292s)** — insects, as well as allowing the chickens to roam around and get some space. And so now
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=297s)** — omega-6 fats are much, much lower. Now, of course, you might not have the space where you can
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=302s)** — actually have chickens. You might not be close to a farmer's market. So what you want to do,
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=307s)** — you want to find a store that sells pasture-raised organic eggs. And I'll tell you,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=312s)** — it's a little bit more money. It's a few more dollars per dozen, but it's really worth it
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=317s)** — because you're going to invest in your health. You're also going to support the farmer who
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=323s)** — cares about your food. Yes, you can find really cheap eggs, but my whole thought is you're
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=329s)** — actually investing. It's kind of like an insurance in your own health. So many people,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=333s)** — when they actually live on junk food, because they're trying to save money, they end up
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=337s)** — paying a lot more in health cost and the cost of lack of energy, the cost of not having the
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=344s)** — quality of well-being. And there's also a company called Angel Acres. I've never spoken
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=350s)** — with them, but what they do is they raise chickens in a super healthy way without doing
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=356s)** — the soy and the corn. And they've tested their eggs and they're much lower with their omega-6
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=362s)** — fatty acids. And yes, they're more expensive, but it's really worth it because you're getting
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=367s)** — a much higher quality product. Now, there's a lot more really interesting information about eggs
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XDIC59gPeo&t=372s)** — that I want to share with you in this video. Check it out.
