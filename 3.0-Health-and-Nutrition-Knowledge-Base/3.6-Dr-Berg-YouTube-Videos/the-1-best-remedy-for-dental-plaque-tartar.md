- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=0s)** — The number one best way to remove dental plaque, aka tartar.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=6s)** — I stumbled on something that's a game changer.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=8s)** — It's not only going to get rid of your tartar, it will also help you prevent cavities.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=14s)** — This is going to be really important with children as well as adults.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=17s)** — Plaque and tartar are biofilm.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=20s)** — When you think about biofilm, think of like this protective shield
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=24s)** — against your immune system that's in your mouth.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=26s)** — So the bacteria make this biofilm, this shield out of calcium,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=30s)** — and it's made by a certain microbe called streptococcus mutans.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=35s)** — This is also the one that's involved in making cavities as well.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=38s)** — So when you consume sugar and especially starches,
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=41s)** — that microbe will make a ton of acid.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=43s)** — And then it takes the sugar and then it starts making this glue-like substance
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=47s)** — that then starts creating a shield or this biofilm gel, aka tartar.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=52s)** — And unfortunately, the acid is now trapped against your tooth,
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=57s)** — causing a breakdown of the actual enamel.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=59s)** — And what's even more wild, they found this microbe in other places in your body,
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=65s)** — including on the valves of your heart.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=68s)** — But not only that, hidden deep in the plaque in your arteries,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=72s)** — you'll find this microbe.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=73s)** — One thing you should also know is what's worse than just sugar
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=76s)** — is when you add a sugar and a starch.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=79s)** — That will form a glue that kind of sticks to your teeth even more than the sugar.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=83s)** — How do we remove this plaque?
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=85s)** — Okay, of course, number one, stop eating sugar and starches.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=89s)** — Number two, hydrogen peroxide, 3%.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=92s)** — Make sure it's food grade and use a half of a teaspoon.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=96s)** — Hydrogen peroxide is very good to start breaking down this biofilm
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=100s)** — and also make your teeth a little bit whiter.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=102s)** — And then you're going to use half of a teaspoon of baking soda.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=105s)** — All right, so why are we using baking soda?
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=107s)** — Well, it's a mild abrasive material that will help to cleanse the teeth.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=112s)** — The big purpose is to alkalize the acidity in your mouth
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=116s)** — because baking soda is alkaline.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=118s)** — And by the way, your body makes that as well.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=121s)** — Your pancreas makes it to help neutralize the acids coming from the stomach.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=124s)** — And then we're going to use three drops of the absolute best essential oil, clove oil.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=131s)** — It helps to disrupt the biofilm and start breaking down the tartar.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=135s)** — It also has other benefits of decreasing pain in your mouth.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=139s)** — But you're going to use three drops of this essential oil.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=142s)** — So now I want to talk about this additional ingredient, microcrystalline hydroxyapatite powder.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=150s)** — Okay, you can buy this on Amazon.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=152s)** — It's not that expensive, but it's a powder of very tiny crystals of a material that bone is made out of.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=160s)** — And you're going to mix a half of a teaspoon with these other ingredients.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=163s)** — They can go into the small little crevices, the little cavities, and remineralize the bone tissue
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=170s)** — and becomes the enamel around the tooth.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=173s)** — Now we can prevent the acid from breaking down the small crevices in your tooth.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=179s)** — And then of course, you're just going to add three teaspoons of water with this.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=183s)** — Mix it all up, put it on your toothbrush, and then in circular motions brush your teeth
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=188s)** — on the outside and the inside once a day.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=191s)** — I also recommend that you find a gum that has friendly oral bacteria that you can chew
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=197s)** — and repopulate your mouth with the good bacteria, which will also help protect you against the formation of biofilms.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=203s)** — Those bacteria not only will help prevent tartar, but it will also prevent bad breath, cavities.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=208s)** — Now, as far as in your diet, one of the best foods that you can consume
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=213s)** — to prevent all these problems that we talked about is grass-fed butter.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=216s)** — When I was a kid, I craved butter for my birthday.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=222s)** — I remember requesting a pound of butter and I would literally just eat it.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=228s)** — I would eat butter. And it's so interesting when I look back, the reason why I crave the butter,
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=233s)** — I had a lot of dental decay and unfortunately every single tooth in my mouth had cavities over time
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=239s)** — and I visited the dentist frequently, unfortunately.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=243s)** — But if I didn't consume those foods as a child and I had the butter, I probably could have fixed my teeth.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=249s)** — But grass-fed butter has vitamin K2, which basically takes the calcium in your body and pushes it into the bones.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=256s)** — Butter also has vitamin A. You also need vitamin A to keep your enamel very, very strong.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=262s)** — It's interesting because an early pioneer, Western Price, who was a dentist back, I think, in the 1930s or 40s,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=270s)** — talked about something called activator X. Activator X actually is vitamin K2 because he noticed some of the traditional cultures
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=278s)** — around the world consumed grass-fed butter. They consumed food high in vitamin K2.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=285s)** — And these are the foods that really kept the teeth super healthy with also good dental bone structure as well.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=292s)** — So I would definitely recommend including grass-fed butter in your diet on a regular basis.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=299s)** — I mean, butter does a lot. It has something else called butyrate, which actually goes into your brain.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=304s)** — Butyrate also feeds your colon cells. So wow that we were told to avoid butter because of the cholesterol
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=310s)** — and this idea that it's going to create a heart problem when in fact it's loaded with vitamin K2
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=316s)** — that keeps the plaque from building up in the arteries, pushing this calcium into your teeth and your bones.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=322s)** — So butter is really good for the bone. It's also good as a raw material for your hormones, including testosterone,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=327s)** — because all of your sex hormones are made from cholesterol. Now that you have the updated protocol
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7g1gKyzL94&t=333s)** — to get rid of tartar and prevent cavities, go ahead and try it and then comment down below and tell me how it worked.
