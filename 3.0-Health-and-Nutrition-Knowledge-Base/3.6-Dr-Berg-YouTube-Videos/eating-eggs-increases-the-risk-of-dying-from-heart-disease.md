- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=0s)** — Sorry to tell you this, guys, but I have some bad news. According to the Physicians Committee
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=6s)** — for Responsible Medicine on the website, they revealed that eating eggs can be hazardous to
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=11s)** — your health. Okay, and they actually list several scientific studies that prove that eating eggs
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=17s)** — can be very hazardous. And I just want to tell you some of the conclusions on these studies.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=21s)** — This is not good, guys. Eating eggs increases the risk of dying from heart attacks. Oh my
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=28s)** — gosh, I've been eating all these eggs this whole time and I'm in trouble. A 2021 study found that
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=34s)** — the addition of a half an egg a day was associated with more deaths from heart disease, cancer,
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=41s)** — and all causes. This is not good. This is scary. Another study they mentioned eating eggs also
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=49s)** — can be connected to developing certain types of cancer, colon, rectal, and prostate. Oh my gosh,
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=57s)** — I'm gonna have to change all my videos, change my diet. This is not egg-citing, guys. I mean,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=64s)** — I thought I was the egg-spert. Apparently not. Well, I tell you what, we're gonna egg-splore
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=69s)** — this topic a little bit deeper. And I think you're gonna be shell-shocked. I'm sorry,
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=74s)** — I just had to do that. Before you evaluate a topic, okay, and you try to figure out what's
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=81s)** — truth or not truth, you have to first make sure that the data is good data, not bad data.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=90s)** — You want to make sure that you include all of the data so there's no missing information.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=95s)** — You want to make sure you don't exaggerate the data. I have all the studies right here.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=100s)** — I printed them out. There's like 10 different studies about eggs. Seven of these studies are
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=105s)** — Two are meta-analyses of observational studies. One is a review article and one is a systemic
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=113s)** — review. These observational studies are based on food frequency questionnaires. None of them
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=119s)** — is an experimental study, randomized controlled trial, which is a study in which a treatment,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=127s)** — procedure, or program is intentionally introduced and a result or outcome is observed.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=132s)** — The problem is with our recall, who's going to remember what they ate in the last 12 months?
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=139s)** — I don't even remember what I ate last weekend. When I was in practice, I would ask people,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=145s)** — you know, what did you eat the previous week, right? They couldn't remember. And then come to
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=150s)** — find out they kind of exaggerated talking about all the good things but not the bad things. So
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=154s)** — it's very, very difficult, if not impossible, to extract the exact thing this person ate
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=159s)** — and the amounts. It's not credible. Questionnaire studies do not prove causation. And as far as
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=166s)** — association, yes, there's an association, but there are so many variables. Why do you pick
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=173s)** — eggs out of the million variables? What about their smoking? What about their drinking? What
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=178s)** — about their medication side effects? What about their genetics? What about their inactivity? What
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=183s)** — about the donut that they just ate? Why didn't you pick that? It's literally impossible to
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=188s)** — this link between two things. Now, at first, I couldn't find if they were actually credible
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=194s)** — studies that showed some randomized trials, things like that. But then I dug a little deeper
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=198s)** — and I found that 100% of those meta-analysis were complete questionnaire, self-reported
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=205s)** — studies. So right there, I can't even evaluate whether the study shows any real
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=211s)** — substantiation or not because it's based on questionnaire studies. So pretty much puts that
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=215s)** — into a certain category, not to mention the conflict of interest. The Canadian Journal of
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=224s)** — Cardiology, this showed that those who ate the most eggs got a higher risk of cardiovascular
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=231s)** — disease. Dr. Spence and the Dr. DaVignon received fees from several pharmaceutical companies
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=236s)** — that sell anti-cholesterol medication. And Dr. Daviston also had support from Pfizer,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=242s)** — AstraZeneca, and Merck. Alright, another study by JAMA. Dr. Wilkins reported receiving consultation
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=250s)** — fees from NGM Biopharmaceuticals. Dr. Mence reported receiving research support from various
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=256s)** — big pharma companies and is on their advisory board as well. So unfortunately, the Physicians
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=260s)** — Committee for Responsible Medicine is putting out doubts about the health of eating anything
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=267s)** — animal products. They're a plant-based physician group, but their membership really is only 5%
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=273s)** — physicians. And honestly, I think it's really, really bad for someone to put out information
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=278s)** — that's just a lie to scare people into not eating eggs. I know the news does it all the
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=286s)** — time. They'll put these little doubts in people's minds. And it's very difficult for
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=291s)** — most people, the general public, to evaluate that data themselves. So they depend on someone
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=296s)** — else who is responsible to do it for them. And I think this is just really a smear campaign on
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=301s)** — eggs. An egg has gotten a bad rap for many years, but the egg is a very interesting protein
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=306s)** — that I want to share right now, some additional information just to give you some factual
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=312s)** — information about what's in an egg. First of all, an egg yolk. An egg yolk is not a
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=320s)** — being chicken, okay? It's the nutrition for that chicken. The egg yolk is probably one of the most
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=328s)** — nutrient-dense, multi-vitamin mineral, phytonutrient substances that you can consume
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=334s)** — bathed in some additional protein around that egg yolk. The egg is almost complete with about
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=342s)** — every single nutrient except vitamin C, but it's loaded with vitamin B1, B2, B3, B5, B6,
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=348s)** — B9, and B12. It's one of the best sources of vitamin A, and I'm talking about the active
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=355s)** — form of vitamin A called retinol. You cannot get retinol from carrots, okay? In carrots you
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=360s)** — have the precursor, beta-carotene, that is supposed to convert into the active form of
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=364s)** — vitamin A. You have to get it from animal sources or egg sources, but vitamin A, which is
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=372s)** — so crucial for your eyes, for your immune system, for your skin, especially the inside
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=378s)** — of your skin, the sinuses, the throat, the lungs, even the colon, anything internal skin
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=384s)** — is supported by vitamin A. And of course, liver has the highest amount of vitamin A,
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=390s)** — but egg yolk is right up there as well. It has vitamin E that, by the way, supports
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=395s)** — the inside of your heart. Eating eggs is going to help your cardiovascular system.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=400s)** — It's going to support the inside layer of the arteries because it has vitamin E,
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=406s)** — as well as vitamin K2, which is very important in removing the excess calcium
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=412s)** — in the arteries. It keeps the calcium out of the soft tissues of the body. It has vitamin D.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=417s)** — Very few foods have vitamin D, but egg yolks have it. And of course, I'm talking about
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=423s)** — an egg that comes from a pasture-raised healthy chicken. Okay, I'm not talking about
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=428s)** — this chicken that's in this cage their whole life. But the egg is the best source of protein,
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=433s)** — the most quality source of protein behind breast milk. It's a super bioavailable source of
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=441s)** — amino acids. It also is the food that has the second highest amount of choline
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=445s)** — behind liver. And choline is important in reducing fat off your liver. It's important
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=453s)** — supporting the brain because it makes this neurotransmitter called acetylcholine to help
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=458s)** — your memory. It also has minerals, potassium, magnesium, selenium. It also has omega-3 fatty
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=464s)** — acids as well, which is good for the heart. Another thing that it can do is it can increase
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=471s)** — the particle size of your LDL. What does that mean? There's two types of LDL. You have the
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=475s)** — small dense particle size, which is the one that kind of invades the arteries. It creates
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=480s)** — more problems, creates more inflammation. But then you have something else that's bigger
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=484s)** — called the large buoyant particle size. And that's the one that is not pathogenic. Also,
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=490s)** — eggs can help reduce your insulin resistance. Think about the carb level on eggs. There's
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=495s)** — not a lot of carbs in eggs. So it's a perfect keto combination of protein and fat
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=501s)** — and nutrition. It also can increase HDL. It has lutein and zeaxanthin. What are those?
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=507s)** — Those are carotenoids. You see those in vegetables, but the bioavailability in
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=513s)** — vegetables doesn't even compare to the bioavailability from an egg. So these two
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=518s)** — carotenoids protect not just the eye, because it's good for the eye, against things like
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=526s)** — macular degeneration and cataracts, but also protects the endothelial tissue inside your
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=534s)** — So no, eggs don't cause heart problems. They help heart problems. So consuming eggs is an
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=541s)** — excellent idea. And the next time you hear some bad news about eggs, take a look at the study.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=547s)** — Make sure it's not an observational study. Make sure that the source of the study,
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=551s)** — it doesn't have conflicts of interest. But the egg can be a super heart healthy food
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7ZGIDmuIw&t=556s)** — to consume. Now, if you haven't seen my new resource page on my website, DrBurg.com,
