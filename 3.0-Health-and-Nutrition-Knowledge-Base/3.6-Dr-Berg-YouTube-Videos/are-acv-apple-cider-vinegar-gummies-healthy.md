- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=0s)** — If you ever get tempted to buy a keto apple cider vinegar gummy supplement, you need to watch this video.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=7s)** — Because chances are at the end of this video you won't be buying that product. It's a very similar formula.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=13s)** — It comes under many different brands like the keto Lux or the Bioscience, BioLife, Vital Pulse, BioHealth, Horback, Justified Laboratories, and Biofast.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=25s)** — And there's probably a hundred more. Incredible claims. You can have instant fat burning, accelerated fat burning, and you can even transform your body.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=33s)** — I mean, right in the title they'll use shark tank, but not as endorsed by shark tank. They just use shark and tank in the sentence.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=42s)** — And then you assume that it's endorsed by shark tank when it's absolutely not endorsed.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=46s)** — So they'll mix weight loss with shark tank. They'll call it weight shark loss tank or shark fat tank loss.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=56s)** — This is called subliminal messaging. It's ridiculous.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=59s)** — OK, now here's another thing that they'll put in there that they kind of trick people made in the USA.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=67s)** — Well, all that means is that they're putting the ingredients together in a bottle in the United States.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=72s)** — The ingredients usually come from China. OK, because I sell supplements.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=77s)** — I know this little loophole that people use and they use it all the time.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=81s)** — Sometimes people even ask me, Dr. Burke, why do you sell supplements? You shouldn't sell supplements.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=86s)** — I said, well, would you rather a marketer sell them who really doesn't know about supplements, that doesn't care about the ingredients,
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=92s)** — that has a brand, but not an individual person behind that brand that you can actually listen to their philosophy.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=98s)** — They'll use terms like gluten free. Right. Well, here you take out the gluten, which is the protein out of wheat.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=104s)** — OK, so you might not be allergic to it. You might not be sensitive.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=108s)** — But now you took up that protein. It's going to be more carbohydrates, less protein.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=114s)** — And they'll even use terms like all natural. Like that really means anything legally. It doesn't.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=118s)** — But the biggest problem with these gummies, OK, is that per serving size, which usually is two,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=126s)** — come out to about three to five grams of sugar. Now, realize one teaspoon of sugar is four grams.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=134s)** — So if it's five grams of sugar per serving size, it's a little bit more than a teaspoon of sugar.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=139s)** — I mean, think about the whole bottle, right? If we add up a 60 count, which is the usual number of these gummies in one bottle,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=147s)** — you're talking about in that tiny little bottle, there are 30 teaspoons of sugar.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=153s)** — This is not a keto product. This is a candy. It should be in the candy section.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=160s)** — But I think people think because they look so cute and they taste so sweet and they're
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=166s)** — really the texture is very chewy. I mean, they wouldn't sell them or they wouldn't claim
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=171s)** — to be keto unless they really were keto. No, they're not keto. Just look at the ingredients.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=177s)** — And then some of these products, they don't even have the ingredients in the listing
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=181s)** — on Amazon. You have to dig and try to find it. But anytime when they list the ingredients,
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=185s)** — the first ingredient is probably the majority of the product. And usually the first ingredient
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=191s)** — is either corn syrup or sugar cane or some other type of sugar. And it's not just
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=199s)** — one sugar. There's like several sugars within the ingredients. If we just take glucose syrup
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=205s)** — by itself, that has a glycemic index of 100. Corn syrup has a glycemic index of 115.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=212s)** — Okay, that is like way, way too high. This is not keto. It's a scam. It'll bump you out of
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=219s)** — ketosis and you'll probably feel bloated and you're definitely not going to lose weight.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=223s)** — You might feel a little bit tired after you take them because that spike in sugar.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=227s)** — The B vitamins that they add are just really, really cheap. And then on top of that,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=231s)** — the apple cider vinegar. One serving size, which is two gummies, comes out to 500 milligrams
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=238s)** — of apple cider vinegar. Well, do you know what an average serving size of apple cider vinegar
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=244s)** — out of the bottle is? 15 grams of apple cider vinegar. In other words, if we compare one
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=252s)** — actual serving size of apple cider vinegar in a tablespoon, that would be equivalent to the
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=257s)** — bottle of gummies. Okay. So when you're getting a serving size of gummies, you're just getting
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=262s)** — several drops of apple cider vinegar. It's not going to do anything. You'd be much better off
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=267s)** — just buying apple cider vinegar, putting it in some water. And by the way, I would always
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=272s)** — recommend the brand Fair Child's not brag because brag used to be good, but they started
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=278s)** — diluting their apple cider vinegar with water, just watering it down, but they didn't
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=282s)** — bring the price down. Right? So if you just add water and dilute it, you make a lot more profit.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=288s)** — But Fair Child's has some really good integrity and they do not dilute their apple cider
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=294s)** — vinegar. In fact, it's raw, it's organic, and it's awesome. But anyway, I wanted to do
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=300s)** — this video because a lot of people ask me, are those gummies any good? Should I get some?
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=304s)** — Are they going to help me? And the answer is a big fat no, I wouldn't waste your money.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=310s)** — I would instead buy some actual real apple cider vinegar. Now, because of the censoring
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=316s)** — and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAl0cx5WNbg&t=320s)** — find my content. And there's a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately.
