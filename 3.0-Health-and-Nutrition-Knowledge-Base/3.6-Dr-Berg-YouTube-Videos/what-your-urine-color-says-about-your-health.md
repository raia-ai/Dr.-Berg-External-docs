- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=0s)** — Today we are going to discuss the color of your urine and what that means. You can use urine as an indicator to determine what is going on deeper inside your body.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=8s)** — First question is, what is urine? Well, urine is filtered blood. Now you have these little tiny magical filters in your kidneys called nephrons.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=18s)** — And these nephrons are very intelligent. They recycle a lot of good material but they also selectively are able to take out the poisons and the bad stuff and push those out of your body.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=29s)** — So today we are going to diagnose or dissect this problem based on just color alone. If you are urinating and the urine is completely clear, this means that you are drinking too much water.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=42s)** — Because you are diluting your urine so much, you are losing all these pigments. Now what is interesting about drinking a lot of water to somehow get hydrated,
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=53s)** — people that drink too much water, they dilute their sodium and they actually become dehydrated. Because the key with hydration is the right amount of electrolytes with the right amount of water.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=64s)** — If your urine is clear, you might not want to drink so much. I always like to recommend drinking when you are thirsty. And especially if you are not working out or sweating.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=73s)** — Too much water could actually be dangerous.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=77s)** — Alright, so the next color is basically yellow or amber. And that color is really coming from a pigment in your blood. I am not going to get into the chemistry of how that happens.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=88s)** — But when you see your urine being yellow, amber or straw colored, that means that it is normal.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=94s)** — Alright, the next color we are going to talk about in your urine is if the color is red or pink. Usually this means that there is blood involved.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=104s)** — Now there are several reasons why you might have blood in your urine.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=108s)** — It could be a kidney stone. It could be that you are menstruating and that contaminated the urine.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=113s)** — This could also be some type of infection or it could be something more serious. But anytime you have blood you should get it checked out by your doctor.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=122s)** — Some people that run a lot like joggers for example, they are doing a lot of pounding on their kidneys. Sometimes that can cause bleeding as well.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=131s)** — Okay, now what about if it is like orange or really almost fluorescent type yellow?
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=138s)** — That usually means that you are taking synthetic vitamins and they are going out through the urine.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=144s)** — And especially the B vitamins, it will give that bright fluorescent color.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=148s)** — It can also commonly mean that there are certain medications that you are taking that have certain dyes in them.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=154s)** — On a rare occasion if your urine is orange it could be something going on with your gallbladder or your liver. But that is not very common.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=162s)** — Okay, what about blue-green urine? What is up with that?
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=165s)** — Well, did you just take something called methylene blue? That will make your urine blue.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=169s)** — Are you taking medication that is turning it blue-green?
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=172s)** — There are a lot of different foods that have artificial colors that will make your urine different colors.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=177s)** — Sometimes an asparagus can make the urine green.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=182s)** — If it is dark brown, chances are you are dehydrated, you need to add more fluid.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=187s)** — As it goes darker into the browns, that is usually a liver problem.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=192s)** — Now, what if your urine is normal color but it is foamy, like someone put some soap in it?
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=199s)** — This could mean several things. It could mean that you are consuming too much protein.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=203s)** — It could also mean you have chronic kidney disease and you are usually going to see protein in the urine from that.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=209s)** — And it can even occur if you are a diabetic.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=211s)** — Because usually with diabetes, with all the sugar coming through, it tends to like rust out different parts of your body, especially the kidneys.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=219s)** — The number one cause of kidney damage is diabetes.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=223s)** — And this is why we see a high correlation between protein in the urine and diabetes and of course the foaminess in the urine.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=231s)** — But probably the first thing you should do is just start cutting down your protein and just see if that handles it.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=236s)** — What about if your urine is just cloudy? It is not transparent. It is opaque.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=242s)** — This usually means there is an infection. And the most common urinary tract infection is from the microbe E. coli.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=250s)** — So if you have that, you might want to get it checked out to see if you do have urinary tract infection.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=255s)** — The other thing you need to know about with an infection is that if you are a diabetic, all that sugar that is in your blood spills off into the urine to feed these pathogens.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=266s)** — And just as a side note, if someone is excessively thirsty all the time, or and they are excessively urinating a lot, that is usually an indication of diabetes.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=278s)** — But it can also be an indication that your calcium is too high in your blood. And that is called hypercalcemia.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7bQGGW3UTg&t=286s)** — Now if you have not seen my other video on urine, I put it up right here. Check it out.
