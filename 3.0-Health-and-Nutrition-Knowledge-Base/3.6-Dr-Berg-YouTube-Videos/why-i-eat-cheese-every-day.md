- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=0s)** — I like to talk about why I consume cheese every single day and why you should too.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=5s)** — No, it's not because I'm from Wisconsin. It's because cheese is a great protein source.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=10s)** — It's almost like a probiotic. And it's low in lactose. Okay, so it's totally keto friendly.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=15s)** — No, I'm not talking about processed cheese or Velveeta cheese. I think the best cheese would
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=20s)** — be goat's cheese and sheep cheese. And I'm going to focus more on that in this talk.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=25s)** — Sheep cheese, goat cheese is A2 casein. That's the protein. And it's not going to create as much
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=32s)** — issue on your digestive system. Some of the oldest people in the world consume sheep and goat cheese.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=40s)** — You're consuming a lot less lactose. Okay, that's the milk sugar. Cow's milk in general.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=46s)** — You're looking at about, I don't know, 3.8 to maybe 4% lactose. Mozzarella cheese or
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=55s)** — cottage cheese, we're looking at between 1 and 4% lactose. But when we look at goat's cheese
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=64s)** — or sheep cheese, now we're looking at like a 0.5%. That's a half of 1%. So it's so tiny,
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=71s)** — it's you're not going to have any issues with that lactose component. And so now we have less
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=75s)** — of a problem with lactose intolerance because it's barely anything there. And also less of a
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=84s)** — problem is it's higher in protein, higher in vitamin A, E, folic acid, certain B vitamins,
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=92s)** — calcium, CLA, which can actually help your exercise performance and weight loss.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=98s)** — Nearly 20 to 30% of the fat in sheep and goat cheese is MCT fats. And these fats are
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=105s)** — really, really good because they bypass a lot of these systems and it goes right to the
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=109s)** — liver and it's converted right into ketones. So you're generating quick energy. They're
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=114s)** — going to be less stress on your digestion. MCT oil is partially made by the good bacteria
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=119s)** — in the gut of these animals. I do consume cow cheese as well, but I make sure it's
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=124s)** — from high quality sources, usually from Europe. I do not do the regular cheese that's
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=128s)** — conventional. I do organic. If you can get a cheese that's been grown at high altitudes
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=134s)** — in the mountains, like the Swiss Alps, because when these animals are grazing on higher
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=139s)** — altitudes, the plants, the grass is higher to the sun and the sun's energy or radiation
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=146s)** — are stronger. And so that plant or grass creates higher amounts of protective elements.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=153s)** — They're called polyphenols, which are phytonutrients. And so when you're
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=157s)** — consuming this cheese that came from an animal that ate this grass at higher altitudes,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=161s)** — you're getting much higher polyphenols, which is also in grass-fed grass-finished
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=166s)** — beef as well. When you introduce these polyphenols into the mitochondria, it triggers this what's
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=174s)** — called an uncoupling effect. In the mitochondria, you can generate energy. When the mitochondria
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=180s)** — is uncoupled, it goes to a different pathway. We're making a lot of heat and that's generating
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=186s)** — a lot of extra, you could say wasted energy. So it's not very efficient. And this is a
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=192s)** — good thing if you're trying to lose weight. But let me just give you another angle to this.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=196s)** — In the 30s, there was a certain drug, DNP. When they gave this drug to people in small doses,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=203s)** — they would lose about a pound a week, right? They're excited about that. But when they
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=207s)** — increased the dosage, they started losing like five pounds of fat per week. But it's a drug
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=213s)** — and it has side effects. It was so inefficient and wasted so much fuel,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=218s)** — the person couldn't get energy anymore. Because you're generating less energy,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=222s)** — the body is going to make more mitochondria in the cell. It's called mitochondrial biogenesis.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=229s)** — Okay. And that's really, really interesting. So we have this interesting effect of these
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=234s)** — polyphenols in the cheese, creating more mitochondria uncoupling and more mitochondria.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=240s)** — They have found in some studies that people that live a long time have more mitochondrial
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=247s)** — uncoupling. And just as a side note or not, there's other ways to stimulate more mitochondrial
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=252s)** — uncoupling. Exercise, cold therapy, fasting, and some of these polyphenols and other
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=260s)** — phytonutrients like sulforaphane, turmeric, and the phytonutrient in green tea. And so the
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=267s)** — reason I'm even bringing up the topic is because I think it's very, very interesting to
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=271s)** — be able to get some of these phytonutrients from your foods, whether it's from a grass-fed
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=275s)** — or grass-finished meat or even the cheese. Now there's another topic that relates to this that
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=282s)** — has me analyze certain phytonutrients in the beef sample that actually I sent off
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=289s)** — to an experiment. If you haven't seen that video, you have to see it. I put it up right
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZTN96VifU&t=294s)** — here. Check it out.
