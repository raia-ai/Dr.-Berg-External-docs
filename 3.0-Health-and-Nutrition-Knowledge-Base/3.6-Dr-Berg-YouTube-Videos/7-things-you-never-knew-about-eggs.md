- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=0s)** — Out of all the healthy things that you could possibly eat, the egg is probably at the top of the list.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=7s)** — Today I want to share seven things that I would guarantee most people do not know about eggs.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=12s)** — And as I go through these items, comment down below on which one is most surprising to you.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=19s)** — Number one, 65.9% of all chickens in the United States are in cages.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=27s)** — They're not even outside the cage, even inside the barn. They live their whole life in a cage.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=32s)** — That's 65.9%. It's terrible. Now out of all the egg and chicken production,
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=40s)** — only 5.8% are organic. That's less than 6%. And unfortunately, they have something called
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=46s)** — industrial organic, which is still in very large barns. These poor chickens don't have
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=54s)** — hardly any fresh air. They don't get the chance to go outside. And if they do go outside,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=59s)** — it's on some cement. They don't even get to touch grass. So just because something is organic
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=63s)** — doesn't necessarily mean it's the ideal scene. You want organic and pasture raised. You really
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=70s)** — want to know the history of that farm. In fact, there's a really good website. I'll put
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=75s)** — the link down below. It's called Cornucopia. They have a rating system for eggs. So you can
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=81s)** — find out which farms are the best. The next point is this. The egg yolk is the second best source
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=90s)** — of vitamin A. And I'm talking about the active form of vitamin A called retinol. So the best
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=95s)** — source is liver. And that also includes cow liver oil. Vitamin A is like the anti-dry eye
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=102s)** — remedy. Vitamin A helps you differentiate in the dim light or the dark. So as you're driving
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=107s)** — and it's dark out, you're able to differentiate and see things clearly. If you're deficient in
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=113s)** — retinol, everything's going to be very, very blurry. Retinol is also the anti-infection
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=119s)** — nutrient, especially for the outer part of your skin and the inner part of your skin. That
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=125s)** — includes the inner part of the mouth, the esophagus, the lungs, as well as the entire
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=131s)** — digestive system. Vitamin A is intimately involved in the immune system that lines
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=136s)** — those surfaces. Vitamin A is important in the conversion of the inactive T4 thyroid hormone
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=142s)** — to the active T3 thyroid hormone. Vitamin A can help decrease the risk of melanoma,
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=149s)** — that's skin cancer, decrease wrinkles. And that probably has mostly to do with all the
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=154s)** — incredibly concentrated fat-soluble nutrients in egg yolks. All right, next point. The egg
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=166s)** — choline helps prevent a fatty liver. Choline supplies the brain to help make the neurotransmitter
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=174s)** — acetylcholine. Choline helps support something called the parasympathetic nervous system,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=179s)** — which is responsible for rest and digest. Now, you probably think the egg white has
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=185s)** — the most concentrated protein compared to the egg yolk. That's not actually true. If you look
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=191s)** — at the protein per a hundred grams of that protein and we compare the egg white to the egg
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=198s)** — yolk, the egg white has 11 grams of protein per hundred grams and the egg yolk has 17 grams
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=206s)** — of protein per hundred grams. Now, the catch-22 about this is that there's obviously more white
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=213s)** — than there is yolk, so you're going to have a little more protein. But that yolk is super
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=218s)** — concentrated with actually more protein per volume. All right, next point. You may have known
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=224s)** — this, but I just want to put it out there. The yolk contains the majority of nutrients,
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=230s)** — okay? Except for two. And I'm talking about vitamins and minerals. The egg white does have
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=236s)** — a little bit more B2 and B3, but if we look at all the other minerals and all the other
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=242s)** — vitamins, it's in the egg yolk. And it's funny because sometimes people will, you know,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=247s)** — cook up egg whites and throw out the egg yolk. I mean, that's like you're throwing out the
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=252s)** — nutrition. Well, that relates to the next point about this. They might throw away the
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=256s)** — egg yolk because they don't want the cholesterol. Well, there is no research
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=260s)** — that indicates that eating eggs are going to negatively affect your cholesterol in any way,
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=267s)** — shape, or form. So now I want you to comment down below on the item that surprised you the
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=272s)** — Now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4gY6261jhM&t=278s)** — more difficult to find my content. And there's a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube,
