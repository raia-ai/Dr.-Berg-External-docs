- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=0s)** — So I guess this is the end of vitamin D research. There is some research done called the vital study
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=6s)** — that involved 26,000 people and they have found conclusively that vitamin D supplementation is
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=12s)** — basically worthless. So they don't want to waste any more money in doing research in vitamin D
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=16s)** — because this is the last nail in the coffin for vitamin D research. So I guess I can stop doing
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=23s)** — vitamin D videos since I have like over a hundred right now. Probably just have to delete
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=27s)** — them. So let me share the quick summary of what the study found. Vitamin D supplementation did
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=33s)** — not reduce the risk of cancer, didn't reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=38s)** — stroke, or cardiovascular death. So this data I'm going to share with you came
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=42s)** — from a recommendation from Dr. Bruce Hollis who is the pioneer of vitamin D research.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=49s)** — And he sent me a fascinating summary of this study and some of the holes in the study.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=56s)** — In this study, they use the same trial protocols as they use in drugs. Let's say, for example,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=63s)** — I'm going to study statin drugs. Okay. And I'm going to take two groups. In one group,
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=68s)** — I'm going to give them the statin drug. And the other group, I'm not going to give them a
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=72s)** — statin. I'm going to give them a placebo. And then we're going to compare what this drug did.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=77s)** — Right? Now, normally we don't have any statin drugs in our bloodstream naturally. And if
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=83s)** — you're taking the placebo, you're not going to get the statin. Vitamin D is a little bit
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=88s)** — different because we naturally get vitamin D from our diet, from the sun. So there was no
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=95s)** — baseline vitamin D tested during the study. They might have tested it, but they didn't
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=100s)** — give us the data. So why is that important to get a baseline? Well, let's say, for
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=103s)** — example, someone is deficient in vitamin D and they take vitamin D. They're going to
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=109s)** — see a result, right? Versus someone else who has enough vitamin D. Are they going to see
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=114s)** — more results if you give them vitamin D? Probably not because they weren't deficient
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=119s)** — in vitamin D. Right off the bat, this study is pretty much null. It shouldn't even have been
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=126s)** — published. And not only that, everyone in the study, including the group who took the placebo,
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=132s)** — were permitted to take up to 800 IUs of vitamin D3 every single day. Yes, even the
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=138s)** — C-bell group. When you take more vitamin D, many times that extra that you don't really need
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=143s)** — is converted into an inactive form of vitamin D3. And then you also have the fact that this
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=150s)** — study measured the amount of vitamin D that was in the blood. Now, when they test the
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=154s)** — vitamin D in the blood, they're always testing the inactive form of vitamin D, kind of the
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=160s)** — reservoir of vitamin D. That inactive reservoir is mainly for the system of vitamin D that
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=166s)** — involves skeletal system, bones, and calcium. There's another system of vitamin D that involves
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=173s)** — the immune system that can help you prevent cancer, inflammation, diabetes, dementia,
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=181s)** — that does not involve vitamin D in the blood. To measure that, you're going to have to
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=185s)** — measure the active form in the cells. They're two different forms. And you're assuming that
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=191s)** — vitamin D in the blood is also acting in this other system, which is a huge error because it's
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=198s)** — not. You could have normal vitamin D in your blood and be virtually empty in the cells.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=204s)** — And then we also have the subject of how much vitamin D was given in this study. And they
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=209s)** — even called it high amounts of vitamin D3, which is only 2,000 IUs. Now, 2,000 IUs might
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=217s)** — sound like a very large number, but it's only 50 micrograms, okay? 50 micrograms,
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=225s)** — not milligrams. That is not enough to affect the rest of the body. Any type of favorable
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=232s)** — research about vitamin D is not welcomed by the journals. Dr. Hollis also mentioned to me
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=238s)** — that he was involved in a study called the VDAART, which talked about the prevention of
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=245s)** — which concluded that if you were to give a woman 4,000 to 6,000 IUs of vitamin D3 in the first
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=254s)** — trimester of a pregnancy, you would very likely get rid of almost all cases of asthma,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=260s)** — but you can't do it with 2,000 IUs of vitamin D3. It needs to be closer to 4,000 to 6,000.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=268s)** — And in the Townsend letter, which I'm going to put down below, there were six additional
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=272s)** — papers that Dr. Hollis mentioned. One that showed that vitamin D decreases autoimmune disease
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=278s)** — by 22%. Another one shows that vitamin D can decrease the incidence of advanced cancer.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=285s)** — Another one says that the more vitamin D in your blood, the lower risk of cancer rate
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=290s)** — and cancer mortality reduces autism. Another one talks about reducing asthma significantly.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=297s)** — And then another one that he was involved with that decreased pregnancy adverse outcomes.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=302s)** — And the New England Journal of Medicine would not publish that article, but he eventually got
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=307s)** — into another publication. So even though the vital study showed that vitamin D was worthless,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=312s)** — there's plenty of other research to show that vitamin D can significantly decrease
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=317s)** — breast cancer, tooth decay, depression, skin disorders, especially psoriasis, prostate
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=324s)** — cancer, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and even colon cancer.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=331s)** — This is also interesting. Women who completely avoid the sun have an increased risk of breast
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=338s)** — cancer by a thousand percent compared to women who get regular sun exposure. Sunbathing itself
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=346s)** — has shown to decrease blood pressure. Being out in the sun can increase serotonin by up to
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=352s)** — 80% just in one day without any side effects. So if you have not seen my interview with Dr.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZrSK4xtXs&t=359s)** — Hollis, I put it up right here. Check it out.
