- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=0s)** — So today I'm going to talk about some of the other benefits of coffee that go beyond just
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=4s)** — waking up in the morning. In other words, I'm going to give you some really important
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=7s)** — reasons to drink coffee. That being said, I'm not recommending coffee if it gives you
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=12s)** — anxiety, it increases your heart rate, and if it prevents you from sleeping. And I'm
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=16s)** — not recommending large amounts of coffee. Just one cup a day. I am the human guinea
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=21s)** — pig for drinking way too much coffee in college. I drank pots of coffee and it
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=26s)** — burned out my adrenals because too much coffee can increase cortisol and adrenaline. So why
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=33s)** — am I recommending coffee in the first place? Well, there's some different chemicals in
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=39s)** — the coffee itself, as well as this one chemical called caffeine. And the benefits
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=45s)** — of coffee come from both caffeine and these other chemicals. And just so you know,
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=51s)** — caffeine is a phytochemical. It comes from plants. It's actually an insecticide and
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=58s)** — it's in 30 plants. But the question is, how can an insecticide be good for us? Well,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=63s)** — sometimes a little poison or a little stress can actually create benefits in our body.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=68s)** — So what is coffee? Really, it's just a fermented coffee bean. That means that
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=72s)** — they're interacting with a microbe to enhance something about that food. I want
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=76s)** — to talk about these other benefits other than the one that most people know. Caffeine inhibits
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=83s)** — a certain compound called adenosine. That keeps us awake. It normally helps us go to sleep.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=89s)** — It makes us tired. Well, by inhibiting that chemical, caffeine will wake you up. But let's
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=94s)** — get into some of the other things that coffee can do for you. It can give you mental acuity.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=99s)** — It can help you focus. It can actually help you actually even learn a little bit better.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=105s)** — It also speeds up the rate of metabolism. It also helps your blood sugars, especially if you add
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=112s)** — some MCT oil or butter to the coffee to make it bulletproof coffee. There's some data that
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=118s)** — shows that it can decrease your risk of getting dementia and decrease certain symptoms
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=125s)** — related to Parkinson's disease and even Alzheimer's. It has certain properties that
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=130s)** — decrease your risk of getting gallstones. And that's because it increases the production of bile
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=136s)** — and the flow of bile. It also has properties to help prevent a kidney stone. There's data to
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=142s)** — show that it has anti-cancer properties, which is interesting. And no, I don't think just
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=147s)** — drinking more coffee is going to get rid of your cancer. It has anti-inflammatory properties,
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=153s)** — hepatoprotection properties. It's basically protection against your liver. There's certain
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=157s)** — things in coffee like polyphenols that help feed your microbiome. There's a condition called
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=167s)** — postural hypotension. Basically you stand up and your blood pressure drops, right? You feel dizzy.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=172s)** — Coffee can help that. If I drink too much coffee, more than one cup, and later in the day,
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=178s)** — I won't be able to sleep that well. So what I do is I have one cup of coffee.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=182s)** — Do I put cream in it? Yes, I do. Do I put sugar in it? No, I don't. And I don't use any sweeteners,
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=189s)** — even alternative sugar alcohols in my coffee. Coffee also helps, apparently, with exercise
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=195s)** — performance, increasing cardiac output and delaying soreness in your muscles. Because
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=203s)** — apparently the neurotransmitters that it activates helps to vasodilate your lungs. Also,
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=210s)** — coffee can help decrease the symptoms of being at a high altitude. So some people have problems
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=218s)** — with that. Well, coffee can help that. And I think that has to do with the sympathetic nervous
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=222s)** — system activation more than anything else, which is really the strength of how you can adapt
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=228s)** — to stress. Coffee can increase mitochondrial biogenesis. Now what is that? Basically,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=236s)** — increases the number of mitochondria in your body. Coffee also has the ability to increase
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=242s)** — stomach acid to help you digest. Now there's some other research that I looked at that talked
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=247s)** — about if you combine certain things with coffee, there's an enhanced effect. So for example,
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=253s)** — if you combine alcohol with coffee, apparently you'll have less jitters, okay, you'll feel
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=258s)** — less jittery. If you smoke or take tobacco with coffee, apparently the nicotine helps clear out
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=267s)** — the caffeine a little faster. If you take certain medications for a headache or pain,
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=274s)** — the caffeine can help enhance the benefits. So this is why anytime I drink coffee,
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=279s)** — I also smoke a cigarette, take a little shot of whiskey, and take my pain medication.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=284s)** — And of course, I hope you understand now my dry sense of humor. I am completely being sarcastic.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=291s)** — And even birth control pills, which personally I do not take, can extend the half-life of
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=296s)** — caffeine, which means that the caffeine will stay in your body longer if you're taking
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=301s)** — birth control pills. Now for those of you that decided that you're going to start drinking
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=305s)** — coffee, you probably need to know how to neutralize the side effects of coffee. And
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoxwcE6g7Qw&t=311s)** — for that, I put this video up right here. Check it out.
