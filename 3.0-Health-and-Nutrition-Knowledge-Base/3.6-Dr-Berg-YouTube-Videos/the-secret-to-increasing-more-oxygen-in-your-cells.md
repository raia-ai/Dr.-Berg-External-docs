- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=0s)** — Now, we've all been told that getting more oxygen into our cells is a really, really good thing.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=4s)** — So many diseases occur because of this lack of oxygen, whether it's ischemia, hypoxia, whatever.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=12s)** — Oxygen is a good thing. So today, I'm going to reveal the secret of how to increase
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=20s)** — available oxygen into your cells. And so you probably already know that sleeping with the
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=26s)** — window open is going to help increase oxygen. Maybe having more plants in your room are going to give
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=31s)** — you more oxygen. You also probably know that exercise will increase oxygen, specifically aerobic
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=38s)** — type exercise. That's the exercise that occurs maybe when you're walking or a slight jog.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=44s)** — Being outside of nature will also give you more oxygen, right? I recently did a video and
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=49s)** — talked about methylene blue can give you more oxygen to the cells, which is pretty interesting.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=54s)** — But there is a very interesting secret about oxygen that I'm going to share with you right now
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=61s)** — that you may or may not know about. In order to increase the available oxygen into the cells,
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=66s)** — the release of oxygen out of your blood cells, there is a trigger. There is this thing
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=75s)** — that controls it. And that is CO2. That's right, CO2. You see, you probably thought
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=83s)** — CO2 was a waste product and it's not needed, you know, as you're breathing out all the CO2.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=89s)** — And by the way, when you're breathing out, an average person is probably breathing out,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=93s)** — I don't know, maybe 25 to 75% oxygen. So it's not all CO2. You're breathing a lot
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=100s)** — of oxygen out too because it's not being absorbed. CO2 is the key for the releasing of
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=108s)** — CO2. And it's called the Bohr effect. B-O-H-R effect. CO2 tells the body to release
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=117s)** — O2. And the way it works is that CO2 increases the acidity, makes things more acid, and then
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=123s)** — that loosens up the oxygen so it can then be released. Take a look at someone that is
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=129s)** — starving from oxygen, someone that is in a panic attack, right? What are they doing?
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=134s)** — They are hyperventilating. What happens when you're hyperventilating is you're trying to get a lot
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=139s)** — of oxygen, right? But you're not getting a lot of CO2. What is the most common recommendation
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=144s)** — when someone is hyperventilating? Breathe in a paper bag. What does that do? That increases
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=151s)** — the CO2, allowing the oxygen then to go into the cells. So it might be a really good thing
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=159s)** — to actually buy an oximeter. You can usually get them as a kind of a pulse oximeter,
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=165s)** — checks your pulse rate and oxygen saturation. And normally it should be between 95 and 99.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=172s)** — Okay. And we're looking at how much oxygen is saturated in your blood. And it's a pretty
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=176s)** — cool test and it'll kind of give you a reading of what's going on. And so in this
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=180s)** — video, I'm going to show you how to increase the oxygen and raise it up to 99 or even 100.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=185s)** — And you can do this test on yourself. At first, when you think about it, it's very
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=189s)** — counterintuitive. We're going to increase our CO2 to increase our oxygen. Sounds weird,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=195s)** — but it really works. Now a couple ways that you can increase more CO2. Breathe through your
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=203s)** — nose versus breathing through your mouth. Yeah, that's right. Breathing through your
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=208s)** — nose gives you more oxygen. You would think when you're sleeping that it would restrict
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=214s)** — the air, which it does, and it would restrict the oxygen, but it doesn't. You'll have a much
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=219s)** — better sleep if you breathe through your nose. Now this is not all about just increasing your
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=224s)** — CO2 100%. We need a balance of oxygen and CO2. Okay. All we're trying to do is balance
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=230s)** — it. When we're under stress, our breathing changes and we no longer balance the CO2
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=238s)** — with the O2. We actually are getting more oxygen and not enough CO2 when we're under stress.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=242s)** — And that's just probably counterintuitive when you think about it, but the solution is to
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=247s)** — increase more CO2. And you can do that by simple breathing as well, like slowing down your breath,
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=253s)** — okay, and balancing out the inhalation with the exhalation. There was one study,
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=259s)** — which I'll put down below, that they added more CO2 to this oxygen and they gave this
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=267s)** — mixture of air to these group of people who all had hypoxia. That's a condition where you have
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=275s)** — lack of oxygen, right? And they all increase their oxygen saturation, which is really
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=281s)** — interesting. So you'll have to prove this to yourself to see if it's true, but you will
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=285s)** — find it is true. But by increasing your CO2, you can greatly help stress, anxiety
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=293s)** — disorders, panic attacks, you can decrease inflammation, you can resolve many times
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=300s)** — depression, you can increase your endurance with exercise, you can decrease symptoms of
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=306s)** — respiratory problems like COPD or weaknesses within the lungs from past injury. You'll even
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=315s)** — be able to hold your breath longer. So how do we do this? Well, the first thing you need
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=319s)** — to do is to do a test to determine something, to determine your carbon dioxide CO2 tolerance,
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=329s)** — how well your body is able to tolerate CO2. And it's a very simple test. And I recommend you
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=336s)** — do it laying down on your back on the floor. All you need is some type of timing mechanism,
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=343s)** — some type of watch, because you're going to just record the timing. So to do this,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=347s)** — you're going to nose breathe, just only breathe through your nose. And you're just going to
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=351s)** — inhale and exhale three times with a timing of three seconds. So three seconds in, three
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=358s)** — seconds out, three seconds in, three seconds out, and just do that three times. Now,
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=365s)** — on the fourth time, you're going to expand your lungs and breathe in as much as you can.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=372s)** — So that fourth inhalation is a very large inhalation. Now, as you time this next
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=381s)** — phase, you're going to be timing the slow, continuous exhalation of air from that inhalation.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=391s)** — And so you're not going to want to hold your breath. You're not going to want to pause.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=395s)** — You just want to slowly let the air out and you're going to time it, right, and see how
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=400s)** — that takes. But it has to be slow and continuous. And so you're going to record the time until you
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=406s)** — run out of air. Okay, so now that you do that, okay, if it's 20 seconds or less,
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=413s)** — you're in poor condition as far as your respiratory system, your ability to tolerate
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=420s)** — CO2. Your stress is probably pretty bad. You probably have a low tolerance to stress.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=425s)** — You probably have anxiety. You probably can't exercise for a long time as well. You probably
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=431s)** — run out of gas. If you're between 20 seconds and 40 seconds, you're in the average group. Okay,
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=438s)** — so not really great, not terrible, but right in the middle. If this exhalation is between
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=443s)** — 40 seconds and 60 seconds, you're above average. Okay, not really good, but you're
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=450s)** — definitely right in that intermediate area. You're definitely above average. Now, if that
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=455s)** — timing was between 60 and 80 seconds, you are considered advanced. Okay, you have good stress
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=462s)** — tolerance. You have good endurance. You're in pretty good shape. You can handle stress
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=467s)** — pretty good. If you're over 80 seconds, you are in the category of elite. Okay, this is
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=474s)** — elite athlete. You have excellent stress responses, excellent cardiovascular, great tolerance to CO2.
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=483s)** — So that is the goal is to get you over 80. So what I want you to do right now is do this test
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=489s)** — and record your number in the comments down below. Okay, I want to read the comments. I want
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=496s)** — to see results. I want to see where you're at. Now, the question is, how do we increase
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=500s)** — this tolerance to ultimately increase your ability to get oxygen in your cells? Because
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=507s)** — it's not just about oxygen. It's about the oxygen availability to the cells, which is
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=513s)** — dependent on the CO2. And again, we're just trying to balance the CO2 with the oxygen.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=517s)** — So a couple things to do. Okay, start doing nose breathing. Keep your mouth shut when you
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=522s)** — sleep. Right. And then even to the day when you're driving, breathe through your nose.
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=528s)** — Another thing you can do is start breathing with emphasis on your diaphragm,
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=533s)** — like just focusing on breathing in through your stomach, not through your chest. Okay. And you're
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=538s)** — going to slowly breathe in through your pushing out your stomach and then exhale slowly. So
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=544s)** — we're going to balance this. And I've talked about this technique to help you sleep as well.
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=549s)** — Start focusing on your sleep, making sure that your inhalation equals the exhalation. And
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=555s)** — that really helps you sleep. And now you know why, because it increases more oxygen,
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=559s)** — because it increases more CO2. And another thing you can do as a practice routine is do box
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=565s)** — breathing. It's called four, four, four, and four. So you're basically just going to breathe
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=570s)** — in for four seconds. You're going to then hold your breath for four seconds, and then you're
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=574s)** — going to exhale for four seconds. And then you're going to hold this exhalation for four seconds.
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=580s)** — And you're just going to practice this, okay, longer and longer and longer to see if you
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=584s)** — do it. So that is going to help you. So nose breathing, this box breathing, diaphragm breathing,
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=592s)** — and also holding your breath. Now, of course, you probably want to do this
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=596s)** — supervised. So that way, if you pass out, it's not a problem, but you can just do this on a
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=600s)** — low level. I don't recommend practicing this while you're driving. I can just see this now.
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=607s)** — Someone passes out and they crash and then they mention my name. Dr. Berg told me to
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=612s)** — hold my breath while I was driving. Well, I'm telling you right now, don't do this while you're
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=616s)** — driving. Okay. Now there are several other things you can do to increase this CO2 tolerance. And
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=623s)** — I'm going to put a link down a website that will give you a lot more information on about
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=628s)** — this. But I just wanted to give you the concept, some basic things that you can start
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=631s)** — doing. If you get an oximeter, now you can actually have some feedback and you can do your
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=637s)** — testing on yourself to see what works and then you can prove it to yourself. But anyway,
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=642s)** — there's some great information on this topic relating to panic attacks and asthma. And if
- **[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVj-U2hU7k&t=649s)** — you haven't seen my video on that, I put it up right here. Check it out.
