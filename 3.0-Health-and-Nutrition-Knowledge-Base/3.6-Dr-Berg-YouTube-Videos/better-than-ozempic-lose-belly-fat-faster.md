- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=0s)** — If you want any chance of burning off belly fat, you need to watch this entire video.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=4s)** — I'm going to explain six foods that will directly prevent you from ever losing your belly fat.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=8s)** — I'm talking about a type of fat called visceral fat. That is a fat around the organs, keeps your
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=14s)** — body in a state of inflammation. And when your own fat is inflamed because you have visceral fat,
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=18s)** — that alone keeps you from burning it. Let's start with the first food. And it's this right here.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=24s)** — Low-fat yogurt, 27 grams of carbohydrate. There's only 19 grams of sugar, but there's an additional
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=31s)** — 8 grams of hidden sugar as starch. But they don't really tell you. You have to read and
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=37s)** — understand the label because the first ingredient is low-fat milk. The second is sugar, water,
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=42s)** — and then the next one is modified food starch. That is hidden sugar. This is what it is right
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=48s)** — here. It's a powder. And let me tell you about industrial starch. It's not just modified
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=52s)** — food starch. It's modified cornstarch, maltodextrin, and many other types of starch.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=58s)** — The reason why it's worse than sugar is that it's not really sweet. So people are consuming a
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=63s)** — lot more of it than actual sugar. If you look at the glycemic index, it turns into glucose
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=68s)** — a lot faster than table sugar turns into glucose. So even though it's not classified
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=73s)** — as a sugar, it acts like a sugar, but worse than sugars. This is creating this constant
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=77s)** — elevation of blood sugar, which is going to burn out your pancreas a lot faster. This is
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=82s)** — leading to more diabetes. What's really wild is the purpose of the starch in food is just to act
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=88s)** — as a filler. It's something to add bulk in a product. Industrial starch goes through high
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=94s)** — heats, chemical processing, deodorizers. They take out the color with different chemicals. So
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=99s)** — you're ending up with this like completely dead product that then has to be flavored,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=104s)** — colored. And if we look at the bottom of the label, it'll say made with bioengineered food
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=110s)** — ingredients. That is another word for GMO, genetically modified ingredients, creating this
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=116s)** — appearance of very healthy, but it's not very healthy. Next food item we're going to talk about
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=121s)** — is processed meat. Processed meat is very different than grass-fed beef. We're going to
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=126s)** — take a look at this chicken hot dogs with pork added. The first ingredient is called
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=132s)** — mechanically separated chicken. What the hell is mechanically separated chicken? That is a
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=140s)** — one. Okay, what I am objecting to, the corn syrup is actually made from the corn starch. This is an
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=147s)** — industrial sugar that will really spike your blood sugar. It's not healthy. When you add
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=152s)** — sugar to meat, what you're going to get is something called advanced glycated proteins.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=157s)** — They're not very healthy. They have to use high heats. They use ammonia, sometimes chlorine
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=162s)** — to kill the bacteria. This is the stuff that they put in the chicken nuggets and a lot of
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=167s)** — other breaded chicken meats. Of course, they also added the modified cornstarch in here as well.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=173s)** — You don't want to buy a hot dog that has that much starch and sugar. A much better hot dog
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=179s)** — would be something like this. Let's take a look at these ingredients. Organic grass-fed beef.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=185s)** — Then we get sea salt, organic vinegar, baking soda, organic garlic, organic spices. Take a
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=200s)** — look at the ingredients. The next one we're going to get to is my favorite, the Atkins products.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=204s)** — This gives you a perception that, wow, it's keto friendly. It's low carb. One gram of sugar.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=210s)** — You're automatically thinking, man, this is great. Until you read the ingredients,
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=214s)** — milk protein concentrate, and then the soy protein isolate, these are very low quality
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=219s)** — proteins. The cheapest proteins you can possibly imagine. The very bottom contains bio-engineered
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=226s)** — food ingredients. It's not truly nutrient dense. It doesn't come from any real food. It's a
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=233s)** — highly processed... If Dr. Atkins ever knew that this company would end up like this, he'd probably
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=238s)** — be very upset. I know I would be upset if someone started to market this under my name.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=244s)** — But typically, when you consume these so-called keto friendly foods, they add a lot of fiber
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=249s)** — in there. It's usually industrial fiber, synthetic fibers. You're going to get a lot of
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=254s)** — diarrhea. Over time, we're going to find out that that's going to really affect our weight.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=258s)** — Just like artificial sweeteners have been found to create more problems with our gut,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=263s)** — converting into things that then lead to insulin resistance and more weight gain problems. The
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=267s)** — next food we're going to talk about is juice. First thing you see is 100% vitamin C. You're
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=271s)** — like, wow, healthy. But when you read the ingredients, this only contains 5% actual juice.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=278s)** — Let's see what the ingredients are. Oh, wow. Water in high fructose corn syrup. This is
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=284s)** — liquid candy. I think this is false advertising. They shouldn't be able to put that on there.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=288s)** — Now, the other thing that's interesting about this is they'll have a concentrated orange juice.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=293s)** — That means that that juice could be sitting up to a year and a vat, losing all of the
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=298s)** — nutrition. Then we take it out and then we add water to turn it into something not very
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=304s)** — nutrient dense. If we're talking about actual juice, like orange juice, that usually has
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=308s)** — more sugar than soda. That's a lot of fructose. Fructose cannot be broken down by all of your
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=314s)** — cells. Only your liver can process that fructose. What happens because of that is
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=318s)** — your liver starts generating a lot more fat. It creates more of a fatty liver than actual
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=324s)** — glucose. Because with glucose, at least all your cells can metabolize it. But with
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=328s)** — fructose, only the liver can break it down. The next product I want to talk about is agave
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=333s)** — It's something like between 15 and 30 on the glycemic index. Now, how can that be? It's a
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=340s)** — sweetener. It tastes just like sugar syrup. Well, that's because 80 to 90 percent of it is
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=346s)** — fructose. Only a very tiny bit of it is glucose. You don't want to consume things that
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=351s)** — are very high in fructose. That's going to really mess with your liver. Coconut sweetener
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=355s)** — would be better. And also honey is better if it's raw. But if you're trying to lose weight,
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=359s)** — probably not a good idea because anytime you consume sugar and starch, you're going to spike
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=365s)** — the glycemic index and that's going to bump you out of ketosis. One little side point about
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=370s)** — insulin. I think it'd be super valuable for all these doctors to do periodic screenings of
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=377s)** — testing your insulin because your insulin will go high about 15 years before your blood sugars
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=384s)** — start elevating. But we don't do that. Doctors don't test insulin. It's going to be left hidden
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=389s)** — to the point where eventually your blood sugars will rise and then you have diabetes and it's
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=393s)** — been brewing in the oven for 15 years. And well, now we've got to put you on medication.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=397s)** — Lastly, I'm going to get into mayonnaise, which basically is mostly soy oil processed
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=403s)** — through industrial heats, hexane chemicals. You're getting a lot of extra things that
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=408s)** — you don't really want. This type of fat goes into your fat cells and it doesn't get
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=413s)** — like saturated fat. It stays in your fat cells longer. And so when you consume this and you're
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=419s)** — just storing this in the fat cell, I think this is behind a lot of chronic disease and
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=425s)** — time is going to prove that especially since they call these oils heart healthy. And that's
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=431s)** — going to be a class action suit waiting to happen. Now, you know, at least six foods and
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=435s)** — the ingredients in those foods to stay away from. If you really want to lose your belly fat,
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxMkIHpRcI&t=440s)** — we're good.
