- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=0s)** — Let's discuss what to drink when you're doing fasting, okay, in general.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=4s)** — Does it really matter?
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=5s)** — Are there things that will bump you out of ketosis?
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=8s)** — Let's first start with water.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=10s)** — Please comment down below of what type of water that you drink.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=15s)** — Is it tap water, plastic bottles?
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=17s)** — Do you use glass bottles? Do you use a water filter?
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=19s)** — I'm really curious.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=21s)** — Obviously, you probably already know that
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=23s)** — tap water is pretty toxic.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=25s)** — So a lot of people are shifting to more bottled water.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=28s)** — The problem with bottled water is that
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=30s)** — you're constantly consuming microplastics
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=33s)** — and once it gets in your body, it's really hard to get out of your body.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=37s)** — And these are endocrine disruptors.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=39s)** — So in other words, they mimic estrogen
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=41s)** — and they kind of mess up your hormones.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=44s)** — But there are certain types of plastics that are lower than others
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=47s)** — like Perrier, Pellegrino, Lacroix, things like that.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=52s)** — And then of course, when you get into glass bottles,
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=54s)** — those are better but they're very expensive.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=57s)** — And then you also have the canned water, right?
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=59s)** — That is expensive but it also has another toxin called BPA.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=64s)** — Unless you live on a farm like I do and get your water from
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=70s)** — you know, a well or a spring,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=72s)** — you're going to be better off getting a water filter.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=74s)** — When I lived in the city,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=77s)** — there was a really good water filter I got
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=78s)** — from a company called Crystal Quest.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=81s)** — I'll put a link down below.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=82s)** — I'm not affiliated with this company.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=84s)** — I'm not getting an affiliate check or anything like that.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=86s)** — But it's a good company for different water filters.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=89s)** — But they have some really good pitchers
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=91s)** — that I want to talk about like these
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=92s)** — containers of water you can keep in your fridge.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=95s)** — So you just get it from the tap.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=97s)** — It filters it through four stages.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=98s)** — It pulls out the heavy metals, the chemicals, the medications,
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=102s)** — bacteria, all this other stuff.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=103s)** — And you have some really good clean water.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=105s)** — And I'm not sure if they have shower filters that pull out fluoride.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=108s)** — And if you get rid of this fluoride,
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=110s)** — you're going to find like your skin does a lot better.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=113s)** — And if you do do plastic water or these
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=115s)** — canned water type things,
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=117s)** — I probably just wouldn't do a lot of them.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=119s)** — You know, just don't make it your lion's share of liquids.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=123s)** — When I drink water,
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=124s)** — I just don't feel that my thirst gets quenched.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=128s)** — There's something about it.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=129s)** — But when I drink carbonated water,
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=132s)** — it's a whole different story.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=133s)** — I actually feel more hydrated.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=135s)** — I can drink that. It goes down fine.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=137s)** — And I do want to mention a theory I have on why that is
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=141s)** — I think better for me.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=142s)** — Is because first of all, there's carbon dioxide.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=146s)** — When you introduce carbon dioxide to your body,
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=149s)** — you create some real interesting effects,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=152s)** — especially with oxygen.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=154s)** — You actually increase more oxygen into your tissues.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=159s)** — With the carbon dioxide,
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=160s)** — you also acidify the water a little bit more.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=164s)** — And that could potentially be better on your digestion.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=167s)** — But yes, we do need oxygen,
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=169s)** — but we also need CO2.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=171s)** — Equally is important.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=173s)** — In fact, there's something called the Bohr effect.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=176s)** — The CO2 helps take that oxygen that gets absorbed in your blood
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=180s)** — and helps push it deeper into your cells.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=183s)** — Let me just give you an example of
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=185s)** — what happens when you get too much oxygen.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=187s)** — When you're hyperventilating
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=189s)** — and you can feel more anxiety and more dizzy,
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=192s)** — things like that.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=193s)** — So what's the remedy?
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=194s)** — To breathe in a paper bag.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=196s)** — What are you doing when you're breathing in a paper bag?
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=198s)** — You're getting more CO2,
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=200s)** — which then helps the oxygen go into the tissues
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=203s)** — and it can pull you out of a state of anxiety very, very quickly.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=207s)** — So again, we need this balance of CO2 and oxygen.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=211s)** — This is why,
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=213s)** — anytime you're stressed, you should slow down your breathing,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=215s)** — breathe through your nose, slowly, in and out.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=219s)** — And in your sinuses, you actually condition the air
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=221s)** — to allow better oxygen that penetrates deeper into the cells
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=226s)** — with the CO2.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=227s)** — And so the CO2 in the water does help increase
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=231s)** — something called the parasympathetic nervous system,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=234s)** — which actually is more calming
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=236s)** — and it's more for relaxation.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=239s)** — And then we have, what can you put in your water?
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=242s)** — Let's first start with
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=244s)** — apple cider vinegar.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=246s)** — Okay, one tablespoon in a glass of water.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=248s)** — What does that do?
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=250s)** — It can give you energy directly.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=252s)** — It can help with insulin resistance.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=255s)** — It can actually help make insulin more sensitive.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=258s)** — It can help the mitochondria work better.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=262s)** — It's also been shown in animal studies
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=264s)** — to help counter the negative effect of aging
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=268s)** — on your mitochondria.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=270s)** — That's pretty cool.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=271s)** — And it can even help you if you have a fatty liver.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=275s)** — If you add some lemon to that,
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=276s)** — you get some additional benefits of vitamin C,
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=279s)** — if it's from raw lemons.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=280s)** — I also add my electrolyte powder to the water sometimes.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=286s)** — Not with every single glass of water,
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=288s)** — but maybe one time in the morning.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=290s)** — Some sea salt to the water.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=293s)** — This is something that I think is just really underrated,
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=296s)** — but very important that a lot of people forget about
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=299s)** — when they do the ketogenic diet.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=300s)** — If you don't have enough salt,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=303s)** — you're going to feel weak.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=305s)** — You're going to find that your sleep
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=307s)** — isn't going to be as great.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=308s)** — In fact, just do an experiment.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=311s)** — Add a little bit of salt to some water
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=313s)** — right after dinner and drink that down
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=315s)** — and see if that doesn't improve your sleep.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=318s)** — Salt or sodium is very important
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=321s)** — for reducing this stress state.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=324s)** — It's called the sympathetic nervous system.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=327s)** — Sodium helps reduce that.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=328s)** — If you're low on salt,
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=329s)** — which a lot of people doing the ketogenic diet are,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=333s)** — especially if you're doing one meal a day,
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=334s)** — they might end up finding that they feel a little bit weak,
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=337s)** — their muscles tighten up,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=339s)** — they get more cramps,
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=341s)** — all because they needed more sea salt.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=344s)** — I do have an electrolyte powder
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=347s)** — specifically for sports.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=349s)** — If you're sweating that has more sodium.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=352s)** — So that can be something that you can use,
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=354s)** — but the whole reason why I design my regular
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=358s)** — electrolyte powder, which has a lower amount of salt,
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=362s)** — is mainly for potassium and magnesium
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=365s)** — because so many people just don't get enough of that.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=368s)** — And when someone starts getting enough of that,
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=370s)** — boy, that can really change a lot of things
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=372s)** — with their energy, their muscle, and their nervous system.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=377s)** — Okay, so that's water.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=378s)** — What about all these drinks that have stevia,
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=382s)** — the natural sweetener?
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=384s)** — You have to be careful because a lot of times
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=386s)** — they'll add maltodextrin to this
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=388s)** — natural sweetener, stevia.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=390s)** — So you have to make sure they don't put that in there.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=392s)** — But a lot of people have like different sodas
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=395s)** — using stevia, different drinks with stevia, totally fine.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=398s)** — And you can also do the sugar alcohols,
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=401s)** — but realize that a lot of times
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=403s)** — they'll add different things in the ingredients.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=405s)** — So you have to read the label
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=406s)** — and find something maybe with erythritol,
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=409s)** — monk fruit, or stevia.
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=410s)** — All right, what about coffee?
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=412s)** — The thing about coffee, it's totally fine.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=415s)** — Personally, I just do one in the morning.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=417s)** — Some people do more.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=419s)** — Just realize that could affect your sleep
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=420s)** — because of the caffeine.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=422s)** — I would recommend doing organic coffee
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=424s)** — because out of all the things out there
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=426s)** — that are so heavily sprayed with
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=429s)** — insecticides and herbicides and fungicides,
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=431s)** — coffee is at the top of the list.
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=433s)** — And even better than even half and half,
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=435s)** — like just 100% cream.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=437s)** — Sometimes people use bulletproof,
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=439s)** — which is they're adding butter and MCT oil.
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=442s)** — That's good for certain people,
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=444s)** — but if you're trying to lose weight,
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=446s)** — okay, and you add that,
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=447s)** — that could slow you down a little bit
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=449s)** — because your body is going to burn those fat calories
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=452s)** — and not your own fat.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=454s)** — Now the next topic is tea.
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=457s)** — You have black tea, green tea.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=458s)** — Just realize that if you do a lot of tea
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=461s)** — in coffee, it can deplete you of vitamin B1.
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=464s)** — So if that starts happening,
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=466s)** — replace it with B1.
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=467s)** — Because if you are low on B1,
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=469s)** — you're going to feel irritable,
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=471s)** — kind of stressed.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=472s)** — And you might think it's coming from stress,
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=474s)** — but in reality, it's just coming from a B1 deficiency.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=477s)** — What about coconut water?
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=479s)** — Well, some people can get away with that.
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=481s)** — Most people cannot because there's sugar in coconut water.
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=485s)** — There's electrolytes in there.
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=486s)** — I would recommend not doing the coconut water.
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=489s)** — Alright, what about alcohol?
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=490s)** — Is that a good source of hydration?
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=492s)** — No.
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=494s)** — They recently have found out
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=496s)** — that there is no benefits to alcohol.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=499s)** — Like they said before, like,
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=500s)** — oh yeah, just enjoy a glass of wine each night
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=503s)** — for your health, to add more health benefits.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=506s)** — They finally acknowledged that wasn't true.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=508s)** — Not to mention knocking you out of ketosis
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=511s)** — and topogy, because of what it does to the liver.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=514s)** — Then we have something called kombucha.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=516s)** — A very carbonated,
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=519s)** — highly pressured, so when you open it,
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=521s)** — it could explode if you shake it.
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=522s)** — But it's kind of a really acidic drink
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=526s)** — that is really good if someone is coming off alcohol.
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=529s)** — It gives kind of a calming effect.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=531s)** — It has a tiny little bit of alcohol,
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=534s)** — but very carbonated,
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=535s)** — but there's still some sugar in there
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=536s)** — because that's how they make it.
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=538s)** — The yeast actually eat up the sugar,
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=541s)** — and it leaves you with all these different acids.
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=545s)** — And a little bit of it is fine,
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=547s)** — but I would not do a lot of it,
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=548s)** — especially because it has a lot of sugar,
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=551s)** — and it can actually slow down your benefits
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=553s)** — of what you're trying to achieve.
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=554s)** — What about blended shakes,
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=556s)** — like kale and blueberry?
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=558s)** — Those are fine, but they will kind of inhibit
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=561s)** — your fasting to a certain degree,
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=563s)** — because there's calories.
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=565s)** — Now, the blueberries are a bit high in sugar,
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=567s)** — so I would just look at that as a meal,
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=571s)** — something that would be more around your meal,
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=574s)** — not during the fasting time.
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=577s)** — Now, what about sports drinks? Oh my gosh.
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=579s)** — You really have to read the labels,
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=581s)** — because like the Gatorade and Powerade
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=585s)** — have a tremendous amount of sugar.
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=586s)** — I'm talking like 34 grams of sugar.
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=590s)** — I mean, if you compare that with a soda,
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=592s)** — that has 39 grams of sugar.
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=593s)** — And the type of sugar that they're giving you
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=595s)** — is probably beet sugar, which is GMO.
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=599s)** — And there's another type of drink called tonic drink,
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=602s)** — which, I don't know, for some reason,
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=604s)** — I love tonic drink, but the problem is
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=606s)** — most of them have sugar.
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=607s)** — You have to get the one that has zero sugar.
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=610s)** — But anyway, I wanted to kind of give you
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=611s)** — a summary of what you should drink when you're fasting.
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=614s)** — And now the question is, what should you eat
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=617s)** — when you come off fasting?
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL7NVrC_sUc&t=619s)** — For that information, watch this video right here.
