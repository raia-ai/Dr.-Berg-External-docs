- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=17s)** — The best way to burn fat and get shredded is not keto, not paleo, and it's definitely not
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=23s)** — intense exercises like this. I mean people must be buying this program because they're
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=29s)** — advertising a lot and they wouldn't spend all this money on advertising if they weren't selling this
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=33s)** — program. And it's your typical, let's shock people into clicking this ad so you can maybe just
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=39s)** — possibly not have to do anything and lose your weight. You can also eat pizza instead of salad.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=45s)** — Which one do you think I'm having for dinner tonight? Well it's not this. As long as you align
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=50s)** — your actions with the body type. So what does V Shred recommend to eat? Well here's an example
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=56s)** — breakfast. You can have oatmeal and fruit. You can have a mid-morning snack with an apple and nuts.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=64s)** — For lunch you can have a salad with chicken and then an afternoon snack, carrots and hummus.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=70s)** — And then for dinner, teriyaki chicken with vegetables and some berries. You can even have
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=76s)** — popcorn and you can have bread on this diet. As long as you eliminate the added sugars and
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=80s)** — processed foods. So let me just do a little bit of a deep dive. Not a very long deep dive
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=85s)** — into something that's very very important. Just so you don't end up doing a program and
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=91s)** — wasting your money and then chalking it up to another thing that just didn't work. In the hopes
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=97s)** — that maybe this is the answer that I can finally lose weight. Maybe I'm eating too healthy or
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=101s)** — reducing too many carbs or maybe I'm exercising too much right? 80% of your results are going
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=106s)** — to be diet and 20% are related to exercise. What does that actually mean and is it actually
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=112s)** — true? And I'm going to tell you that it's not actually true. It really depends on another
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=117s)** — thing. Okay? Because there's two things about diet. It's of course what you eat. If you
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=123s)** — know anything about fat burning, it's really tied into the insulin component part right? If you
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=128s)** — lower your insulin and your body can now stop storing fat and you can start burning your fat.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=133s)** — And that's basically really about lowering your carbohydrates. The lower that you bring your
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=138s)** — carbohydrates, the more fat you're going to burn. Well it doesn't always work. So there's
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=143s)** — this other variable of when you eat. Okay? Because there are a lot of people who I know
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=149s)** — who go on the ketogenic diet, low carb diet and they're healthy foods. They don't lose any
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=154s)** — weight. Of course when you look at the frequency of eating, they're eating three
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=158s)** — meals with three snacks. But that's all good food. So why can some people lose weight
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=164s)** — and yet other people can't? It has to do with this one thing and that is insulin resistance.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=172s)** — If they have insulin resistance, which by the way is about 70% of the population, the people
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=177s)** — that are successful just by reducing carbohydrates, just like the simple sugars and some of the
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=182s)** — refined foods, that is a much smaller percent of the population. But they can actually lose
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=186s)** — weight because they don't have insulin resistance. Somehow they never got it. Maybe it's part
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=194s)** — of genetics. Maybe they haven't lived on so many carbs and sugar like the rest of us. But the
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=199s)** — point is the more insulin resistance you have, the more you have to not just lower your carbs,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=204s)** — but the more you have to do infrequent eating. That's called intermittent fasting.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=210s)** — Now if we just take a look at the two main things that increase insulin, carbohydrates
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=215s)** — and the frequency of eating. As in a lot of different meals, a lot of different snacks.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=219s)** — If we just take a look at those two things and we compare them,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=223s)** — I'm going to tell you right now the frequency of eating and the snacks is way, way, way,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=229s)** — way more important and way more significant than just lowering your carbs. Because there are a
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=235s)** — lot of people that can pretty much eat whatever they want and they're still able to lose
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=241s)** — weight. But they only eat just one meal a day with absolutely no snacking versus a much
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=247s)** — smaller percent of the population which start reducing their carbs and they haven't
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=253s)** — introduced intermittent fasting yet. But some of those people will lose weight. Okay, but not a
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=258s)** — large percentage. And when we're talking about this B shred guy, he's pretty much focusing on
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=264s)** — a very small percent of the population that can lose weight just by reducing some of the junk
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=270s)** — foods and reducing the added sugars and the processed sugar because he allows fruit
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=276s)** — and things like that. I mean the reason I know this is because my initial diet was very similar
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=281s)** — to his. I didn't recommend intermittent fasting. I did recommend these snacks,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=286s)** — apples and nuts, lowered fat and a very similar diet. And I was successful to some degree.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=292s)** — I wouldn't say that it was a high level of success like it is now. So if you wanted to
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=297s)** — know can you lose weight and eat what you want? Yes, you can. For a certain small percent
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=303s)** — of the population who does not have insulin resistance, they just need to cut down a little
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=308s)** — bit on their carbs. But for everyone else that has insulin resistance, which is like 70% of the
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=312s)** — population, they're going to have to do fasting like one meal a day. And they will
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=317s)** — definitely experience results. But my whole point is why not combine intermittent fasting
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=323s)** — with the reduction of carbohydrates? Because it's not just about weight loss. It's about
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=329s)** — reducing your inflammation. It's about removing fat from the liver. It's about looking good
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=335s)** — as you lose weight because your skin is better and you're not putting all these other things
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=340s)** — in your body that don't contribute to healthy cells. It's also about reducing your risk for
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=345s)** — all the other chronic degenerative type problems. However, in this video, I really
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=350s)** — just wanted to differentiate the different variables in losing weight so you can kind of
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=356s)** — wits around it and understand why some people lose weight on a certain diet and others will not
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=363s)** — and what they have to do. And for a lot of people, especially with insulin resistance,
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=367s)** — it's not just lowering your carbohydrates. It will help. It will actually get rid of like
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=372s)** — two weeks of water weight. But unless you add that intermittent fasting, which is way, way,
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=378s)** — way more significant than just lowering your carbs, you probably are not going to see a
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=384s)** — change. So my suggestion is also not to just lower your carbs. It's to increase the quality
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=390s)** — of your food. That's called healthy keto and implement the intermittent fasting as well as
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=396s)** — the right exercise. And also as a side note, the reason why some top athletes can get away
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=402s)** — with eating a lot of sugar is because the exercise stimulates the mitochondria and kind of
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=409s)** — neutralizes to some degree some of this sugar effect on your mitochondria, which I don't
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=415s)** — recommend it. But just so you know, exercise I think is really important, not just for weight
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=420s)** — loss, but for stimulating your mitochondria, which is at the heart of so many health problems
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl34wXQ4-Ww&t=429s)** — out there. Now, if you really wanted to know how to do healthy keto, just the basics,
