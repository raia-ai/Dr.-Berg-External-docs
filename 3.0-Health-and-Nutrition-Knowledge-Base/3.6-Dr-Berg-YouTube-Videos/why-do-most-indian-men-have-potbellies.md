- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=0s)** — So the question we're going to resolve today is why do most Indian men have this protruding pot belly?
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=7s)** — Indian women also are getting larger midsections as well. Why is this and what could be done about
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=13s)** — it? When I was in practice a good portion of my patients were from India and the reason they
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=18s)** — came in is to get rid of this belly fat. But it's not just belly fat. There is a huge component
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=25s)** — of digestive problems. Anytime someone has a belly, they're also going to have a fatty
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=31s)** — liver. And then when you do a deep dive into the topic of digestive problems in India,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=38s)** — well, we don't really know. It's unknown. It's probably stress. It's a lack of exercise,
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=43s)** — but they're missing the obvious. What's the elephant in the room? Let's dive into that topic
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=48s)** — right now. If you understand the word omnivore, that's a specific diet that involves plant base
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=55s)** — as well as animal products like meats. Then you have the word herbivore who eats plants.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=63s)** — And if we look at a gorilla, which is an herbivore, and they're grazing all day long
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=68s)** — to get enough food, they always have a protruded huge belly, sometimes even wider
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=77s)** — than their shoulders. Now, if we compare that to a chimpanzee who is an omnivore, they will eat
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=83s)** — other animals and meat as well as plants. Chimpanzees have flat stomachs. We have a
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=90s)** — goat named Billy. Karen was gone for a few days, so I was looking after the goats and I
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=95s)** — noticed baby Billy had this huge protruded stomach and I was concerned. And so I drove
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=101s)** — over an hour to go to the vet to see what was wrong. And the vet took one look at Billy and
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=108s)** — said, this is normal. Goats are supposed to have a belly. And I'm like, oh, okay, I had no idea.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=114s)** — So what's going on there? And how is that similar to humans? Well,
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=118s)** — in an herbivore situation, they are fermenting fiber, but it's actually the microbes in the
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=124s)** — And so the animal gets its protein from the bacteria that's eating the fiber,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=131s)** — because bacteria is like 60% protein, which can then be absorbed by the herbivore,
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=138s)** — because these animals cannot digest the fiber directly. Out of all the countries in the world,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=144s)** — India consumes the least amount of animal meat. They're getting way too much fermentation
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=150s)** — in the small intestine. And there's a condition called SIBO, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=157s)** — And that's a situation where you're getting fermentation in the wrong place,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=161s)** — because you have the stomach, then you have this long small intestine, and then you have
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=165s)** — the large intestine. The way it should work is that you should digest the fiber in the large
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=171s)** — intestine. If you look at the history of what an Indian ate 5,000 years ago, 100 years ago,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=179s)** — they were not big meat eaters. However, they did eat meat here and there. And occasionally they had
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=185s)** — goat and sheep, but not beef. In the current diet, the three primary ingredients that are in
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=192s)** — pretty much all ultra processed foods are the sugar. This is glucose syrup. So it's not even
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=198s)** — like real sugar cane. It's synthetic sugar. Then you have the seed oils right here, highly
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=204s)** — industrial processed, highly inflammatory. And then of course, we have the starches in the form
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=211s)** — of multidextrin food starch. We're not talking about potatoes. We're not even talking about
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=218s)** — unrefined rice. We're talking about refined starches. So we have all of that in their
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=224s)** — diet, especially when someone doesn't have the money and can't afford higher quality foods.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=230s)** — And so if we add that into the mix, now we start to really break down the stomach lining
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=236s)** — to the point where you can get ulcers, something called gastritis. And it's when we start eating
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=242s)** — junk foods and we weaken the system that that microbe comes out and starts creating a
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=249s)** — wearing of that mucus lining in our stomach. Suspect that's H. pylori. And H. pylori has a
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=255s)** — interesting strategy to help it survive decreasing your stomach acid. So it starts making
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=263s)** — ammonia. And so that changes the pH of your stomach. So now it can survive. And here you
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=269s)** — are having a stomach that's no longer acid. So now try to digest, right? And now you can't
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=275s)** — kill off the microbes. Not to mention a lot of people take antacids, which weaken the
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=281s)** — system even more. And that can even increase the risk of getting H. pylori. And then when
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=285s)** — GI doctor looks at you, they're not finding anything. So they just treat you. They're not
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=290s)** — trained in diet or food therapy. That's the big omission. That being said, how do we correct
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=295s)** — this problem? Anything that's bloating you is not good for you. Mark it off the list.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=300s)** — Don't eat it again. And this could involve fiber, vegetables. It can also involve fruit.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=306s)** — And a lot of these grains also are very high in omega-6. So it's going to create
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=311s)** — inflammation. Now, the other thing I would do parallel to this is I would not do
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=316s)** — snacks between meals. I would do intermittent fasting because that's going to instantly give
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=321s)** — your digestive system a break, a chance to heal. Now, what's interesting about meat,
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=328s)** — there's something called the carnivore diet. I'm not telling you to do it. I'm not telling
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=332s)** — you not to do it. But a lot of people do the carnivore diet to heal their gut
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=336s)** — because you eliminate all these other fibers that are irritating the inflamed stomach.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=343s)** — Meat is loaded with glutamine that seals the gut. I tried to be a vegetarian and I got too
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=350s)** — much bloating because in my mind I thought that, oh wow, you need fiber to eliminate.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=355s)** — And that is absolutely, positively not true. Now, whether you're going to do a carnivore or
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=359s)** — not based on religious reasons or whatever, you do want to start introducing more protein.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=365s)** — And that can be fish, eggs, things like that. And typically animal protein is much easier to
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=373s)** — digest. So what I'm telling you to do is clean up the refined carbs. See how that goes.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=380s)** — And if you still have bloating, you're going to have to start eliminating some of these other
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=384s)** — foods. There's a couple other things I would recommend. One remedy is called betaine
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=388s)** — hydrochloride. The only time I wouldn't take it is if you have an ulcer or gastritis.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=393s)** — It's going to increase the acid of your stomach. And so when you take this betaine hydrochloride,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=397s)** — you take like maybe five or six of them at a time before you eat, your stomach's going to
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=402s)** — start feeling better and better and better because you're reestablishing that pH. So when
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=406s)** — you eat food, if there's pathogens in there, they'll be killed and then they won't end up
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=412s)** — in your small intestine and start to ferment and all these other issues. So I think this is
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=417s)** — turn things around. But for a more detailed understanding of the digestive system and
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_9gjsFT9o&t=424s)** — what to do for various situations, I put that up right here. Check it out.
