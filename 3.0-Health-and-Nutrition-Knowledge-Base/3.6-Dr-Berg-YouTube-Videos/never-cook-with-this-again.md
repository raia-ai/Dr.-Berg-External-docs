- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=0s)** — Why is it that the average person is consuming a very specific type of oil on a regular basis,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=6s)** — not just cooking with their food, but on their food as well? This oil is not just consumed
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=11s)** — at home on a daily basis, but every time you go to a restaurant, nearly every single restaurant
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=17s)** — is putting gobs of this oil on your food. When you go to the grocery store, over 70%
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=24s)** — of those foods have this oil. It comes in a clear bottle. You can open it. You can expose it to air.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=31s)** — It doesn't need to be refrigerated. Unfortunately, this oil is vegetable oil,
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=36s)** — which by the way is not even vegetables. Let's just call it what it is. It's seed oils.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=40s)** — Seed oils are so processed with super high heats over 400 degrees Fahrenheit. They use
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=47s)** — chemical solvents to extract the oils out. If they didn't deodorize it, it would have
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=52s)** — a really bad taste and a bad smell. This is just basically adding more heat. And by the way,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=58s)** — when you add heat to a lot of these oils, you develop all sorts of toxic byproducts
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=63s)** — like trans fats. There's actually nine other compounds that are very toxic that are produced
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=68s)** — by heating these seed oils. Not to mention, almost every single one of these seed oils
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=74s)** — is genetically modified. There's going to be traces of an herbicide called glyphosate.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=79s)** — Just because an oil is deodorized doesn't mean you're getting rid of the rancidity or the
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=85s)** — oxidation. It's more like hiding these toxicities because now you can't smell or taste it. It's
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=90s)** — kind of like just clear. One of the toxic components, which is BHA, is a possible human
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=96s)** — carcinogen. The other ones can affect the immune system, the nervous system, and your liver.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=100s)** — I just need help understanding why are we using this oil? Why is it considered heart
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=106s)** — If you watch some of my other videos, Gross, generally recognized as safe, is really something
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=112s)** — that the industry itself can put that stamp of approval. They can do their own studies, which
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=117s)** — are not independent. If you look at vegetable oils, you'll see this argument that vegetable
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=122s)** — oils are fine as long as you don't heat it. Because if you go to a fast food restaurant,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=127s)** — they're going to reheat it like a hundred times, which is going to make it really,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=131s)** — really, really toxic. They'll say if you don't heat it and you put it on your food,
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=134s)** — it'll be fine. It's already been heated to over 400 degrees. It's already been manipulated.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=140s)** — This fragile oil has now become degraded and starting to become destroyed. It's just bizarre
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=146s)** — how the whole thing flipped, right? They made saturated fats the bad guys and unsaturated fats
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=150s)** — the good guys, which is absolutely, positively a big fat lie. Here's the problem that I have
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=156s)** — with seed oils. If you look at almost every chronic disease out there, all of these
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=163s)** — involve one common denominator and that is inflammation. Why the heck would anyone want
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=169s)** — to consume even a drop of this rancid, highly inflammatory oil? I believe that these vegetable
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=176s)** — oils are the most inflammatory thing that you can consume. Think about what they do to your
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=182s)** — cells. They're creating damage. What this oil does to our bodies is not necessarily converted
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=187s)** — to fuel. A lot of it's stored in the fat cell and it's going to make that fat cell very sick.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=193s)** — We have a lot of membranes through our whole body and to detoxify vegetable oils from our
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=198s)** — membranes, it takes literally a year and a half to two years by just not eating them.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=202s)** — No wonder why the number one selling drug in the world is Humira, which is an anti-inflammatory
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=210s)** — drug. Why do you think that is? Because we have way too much inflammation. I'm excited
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=214s)** — about a new product we just released, which is our zinc product. It's a zinc product with
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=219s)** — magnesium, with vitamin D3, as well as selenium. This is a great product to help boost the immune
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=224s)** — system and to support healthy skin and hair. I added vitamin B6. I also added copper. In each
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=231s)** — capsule we have 30 milligrams of zinc to maximize bioavailability. What type of seed
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=237s)** — oils are we talking about? We're talking about soy oil, corn oil, sunflower, canola,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=242s)** — cotton seed. But the most dangerous seed oil of all of them is the cotton seed oil. This is the
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=247s)** — oil that produces the most toxicity. It has the highest amount of omega-6 fatty acids, making it
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=253s)** — very inflammatory. And they hide it in a lot of animal feeds, which ends up in the animal
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=258s)** — and ends up indirectly in our body. Anytime you have inflammation, you're going to have a
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=262s)** — lack of oxygen. Cancer thrives in an area that's either inflamed and or doesn't have
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=268s)** — oxygen. It triggers cancer to grow more. This inflammation can also directly cause
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=273s)** — insulin resistance, which a lot of people have as well. Not to mention it's just
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=277s)** — accumulating and it's shortening your lifespan. And it's behind a lot of inflammatory
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=282s)** — conditions that actually start either in the artery, it might start in the brain, it might
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=287s)** — start somewhere in the body that turns into a bigger problem later in life. If you ask someone,
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=292s)** — what are some things to be healthy? Well, have lean meats, avoid saturated fats. But in
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=297s)** — reality, saturated fats were never the bad guy. Saturated fats are very, very stable.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=302s)** — There's actually not a lot of saturated fats in junk food. It's mostly the unsaturated fatty
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=307s)** — acids. You do not want to use vegetable oils at all in the diet. If you have it in the
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=314s)** — house, I would take them out, bring them in the garage and use them to lubricate
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=318s)** — different car parts or certain mechanical things that require lubrication. That would
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=324s)** — be the best use of them. They're toxic. You do not want to cook with them either. If you cook
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=328s)** — with them, it's going to be worse because it creates more of these byproducts that create
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=332s)** — more damage. What do we want to replace the C2O's with? Well, something like this extra virgin
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=338s)** — olive oil, something high quality. I use this in a vinaigrette on all my salads. You can cook
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=345s)** — with olive oil. It's not the perfect solution. If you're going to use high heats, I
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=352s)** — actually handle a lot of heat or I will use Kerrygold butter or a similar type of butter.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=358s)** — You can also use ghee. It's clarified butter. They take out some of the protein. That way,
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=365s)** — when you heat it up, you won't get the smoking or anything that happens with cooking
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=369s)** — the protein. If you can find something like this red palm oil that is organic, unrefined
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=376s)** — red palm oil, it's going to be a lot better because it's not damaged. It's not processed.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=380s)** — You can use this just like you would use coconut oil, but you can actually put it in your food.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=385s)** — Another thing that has a lot of seed oils is mayonnaise. I like mayonnaise in my food.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=390s)** — You want to find a mayonnaise like this. You just need to read the label. This has
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=394s)** — avocado oil, which is a lot better than soy oil, and then filtered water, egg yolks,
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=400s)** — organic whole eggs. This is awesome. This is a great mayonnaise. But even some of the ones
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=407s)** — say it has avocado oil or even olive oil, if you read them, you'll see that the second ingredient
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=414s)** — or the third ingredient or the first ingredient is either soy or canola oil or some other oil.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=420s)** — Another good fat to use in your food is very savory tallow fat. That is basically beef fat.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=426s)** — Long ago, McDonald's used to fry their french fries in tallow. Definitely to give it
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=431s)** — a lot more flavor. Lard, pig fat, is another fat that some people use. You just want to find
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=436s)** — high quality lard. That lard is great to cook in because it really makes your food taste
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=441s)** — incredible. It's a super stable oil. It's not going to go rancid. The best thing to do is not
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=446s)** — to necessarily fry anything or eat any deep fried foods at all. That would be the ideal
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=451s)** — situation. The air fryer. We use one of those. Works great. You can simulate fried food
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=457s)** — in that very easily with the right ingredients and the right breading. So you're not using
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=462s)** — actual wheat breading. You're using some other sources like crushed up pork rinds. We can use
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=468s)** — it as breading. And then you put that on chicken with certain seasoning and you put that
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=473s)** — in the air fryer. Amazing. This heart healthy seed oil is actually very damaging to your heart.
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=479s)** — You don't want to eat it. Get it out of the house and make sure they don't hide the
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOV5vIsjQhg&t=483s)** — seed oil in the food. Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.
