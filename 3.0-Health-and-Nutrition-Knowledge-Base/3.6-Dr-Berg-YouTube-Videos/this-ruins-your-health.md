- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=0s)** — Knowledge Doc is a nutritionist and chiropractor specializing in healthy eating and alternative
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=6s)** — healthcare more broadly. He has published over 6,000 videos and amassed 13 million followers on
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=12s)** — YouTube, and has trained over 2,500 doctors and healthcare practitioners in how diet can impact
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=18s)** — your health. You reduce carbohydrates, it then forces your body to go after your own fat as
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=23s)** — fuel. So for weight loss, it's great. And for other things, it's good too.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=26s)** — In this episode, we discuss his approach to health, from superfoods to intermittent fasting,
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=32s)** — and get his thoughts on Bobby Kennedy as HHS secretary.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=35s)** — I think if we are going to make some changes, we have to first of all,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=38s)** — make people aware of these hidden ingredients and start to get them out of your diet.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=44s)** — This is American Thought Leaders, and I'm Jan Jekielek.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=49s)** — Eric Berg, such a pleasure to have you on American Thought Leaders.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=53s)** — Well, I'm really happy to be here. I've watched your show for many years.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=57s)** — And so thank you for having me on.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=60s)** — Well, so let's talk about disease and health in America. We spend here in America,
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=68s)** — an incredible amount per capita on healthcare, but the outcomes compared to the amount
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=73s)** — that's actually being spent, seem pretty low. Now, why is that?
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=76s)** — Yeah, you're right, because we spend $4.5 trillion, and we have the worst health.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=81s)** — I think that I'd like to just kind of give everyone a bird's eye view of what I think
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=86s)** — the situation is, because it's really kind of simple when you step back and look at it.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=91s)** — It's like on the one side, you have big pharma. Okay, they're helping provide the
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=97s)** — solutions to our medical problems. And then the other side, we have big food or the junk
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=101s)** — food, and they're both kind of funneling down this way. And right in the middle, you
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=106s)** — have the medical establishment, the system that we're operating off right now, and the
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=111s)** — shift basically, if you want to get healthy, you just take this pill for your symptom.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=118s)** — But if we look at the chronic disease, most of that comes from our diet and
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=126s)** — ultra processed food calories. It's the junk food, right? That's the majority of
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=130s)** — problems. So when you look at it, these medications are basically treating the symptom
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=134s)** — of the junk food. We don't really bring up the diet in that consultation with the
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=139s)** — doctor. When the doctor evaluates someone, they're not really diving into what they eat.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=143s)** — When I was in practice in Alexandria, Virginia for 30 years, I would all day long, the first
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=149s)** — question I would ask is, what are you eating? Someone came in with a problem, whatever it is,
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=154s)** — when did it start? What did you eat just before that? I had a patient who went to
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=160s)** — several doctors, including the emergency rooms spent out of pocket $40,000 for her heart
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=165s)** — problem. She had angina. And no one asked her, like, what did you eat just before you had the
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=170s)** — symptoms? It was a series of really bad banana splits, right? And like every day for like
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=177s)** — three days in a row. And all I had to do is just change her diet and all that angina went
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=182s)** — away. They couldn't find anything on the test. And define for me junk food, because I
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=187s)** — actually think that might mean different things for different people. In order to define junk food,
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=191s)** — you really have to define what food is first to compare it. Because it's kind of hard to talk
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=196s)** — about junk food without knowing what food is. Food is that which is eaten to sustain energy,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=203s)** — the growth and repair of tissue, nourishment. That's what the Latin word for food means.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=209s)** — If we compare that to other things that we're eating, like junk food,
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=213s)** — can junk food actually sustain life? Can it repair our bodies? Can it help us grow?
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=218s)** — The answer is no. You're taking a food that's so refined, so processed, so dead. There's nothing
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=225s)** — else in it. They take all the nutrients out of it. They put a couple of synthetic vitamins
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=229s)** — in there. You have a lot of byproduct and chemicals. It's so refined. It just can sit
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=233s)** — on the shelf for a long time. Is that food? I don't think it is. Junk food is not food.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=239s)** — It's something else. And it's composed of mainly three things. We have the refined sugars,
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=245s)** — the refined seed oils, and the refined starches, which is basically hidden sugars.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=251s)** — And of course, that's like the main three ingredients, but then there's
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=255s)** — food coloring, and then there's flavorings that you add onto it, and you have preservatives.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=260s)** — So if you look at the ingredients of a lot of these foods, it's the same ingredients with
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=264s)** — different flavors, different colorings, different packaging. If over 50% of the population
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=269s)** — is consuming junk food, adults, and over 63% of teenagers are consuming
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=277s)** — these ultra processed foods, then how are we going to be able to create health? You can't.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=280s)** — This is really at the root of chronic disease. We're not eating things
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=285s)** — to sustain life. And this is why we have the chronic illness.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=290s)** — Let's talk a little bit about these 30 years that you were in practice. I understand you
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=293s)** — were a chiropractor primarily, but then of course, you sort of branched out from there.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=300s)** — Can you give me a picture of that, please? I had no intention of kind of getting into
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=305s)** — what I am to now because I would literally eat pure junk food all the way up until I was
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=312s)** — like 28 years old. And I got away with it for so many years, but then it caught up with
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=317s)** — me. But the only thing green that I ate, I think was pistachio ice cream and lime green
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=322s)** — jello. But other than that, I never ate a vegetable, never ate anything healthy. And so
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=329s)** — getting in my 20s and all of a sudden I was like arthritic in my fingers and my back. I had
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=336s)** — chronic fatigue syndrome. I was just, I couldn't sleep. I started going downhill. In fact,
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=341s)** — my wife was like, you don't look too good. You look kind of gray and almost greenish.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=345s)** — I was going downhill. So of course, it was a good and bad thing. The good thing was it
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=352s)** — kind of woke me up to eating healthily and figuring out things because I stumbled on what
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=357s)** — to do to correct things. But if I never had that experience, I never would have got into
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=362s)** — health at all. I stumbled on a book called Mastering the Zone. And I didn't even read
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=367s)** — the whole book. I just read the introduction and it said something about insulin and avoid
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=372s)** — carbs and eat high quality protein. So the next morning I had a buffalo burger instead of my
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=379s)** — cereal, which I thought was really bad for you at the time because it causes cancer,
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=384s)** — which is totally a lie. So I ate that and it was almost like someone just literally took a helmet
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=388s)** — off my head and I could actually think clearly. I was like, oh my goodness, this is amazing.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=393s)** — The way I was trying to solve my problems back then, instead of changing my diet,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=397s)** — I would just be taking this supplement, doing colon cleanses and detoxes and
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=402s)** — driving down the street. I would tell my wife, hey, there's the health house. Let's go
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=407s)** — in there and then come back with a whole bunch of vitamins. And it wasn't working
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=411s)** — because the foundation wasn't there. So tell me about the ketogenic diet.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=415s)** — There's some people that, even medical professionals who say it can become dangerous.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=421s)** — Explain to me how this works. Yeah, in real simple terms,
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=426s)** — you're basically just eliminating the massive amount of carbs that people eat.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=431s)** — Because when you reduce carbohydrates, it then forces your body to go after your own fat as
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=436s)** — fuel. For weight loss, it's great. And for other things, it's good too. The average person
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=441s)** — that's not overweight has literally a hundred thousand calories of fat on their body.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=445s)** — So they have a lot more stored energy for running on fat than they do from the dietary
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=452s)** — source of calories. If you don't tap into your own fat, then you're going to be
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=456s)** — dependent on the next meal. You're not going to be able to go long before you're hungry.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=460s)** — So when you start shifting off to the ketogenic diet, which is basically,
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=464s)** — it's the breakdown of fat into ketones as an alternative fuel, then you can go a lot
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=470s)** — longer because you're running off these calories that are just stored.
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=475s)** — And that allows you to get rid of your cravings and your hunger and produce a whole bunch of
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=481s)** — health effects, especially for your brain and your heart that you never could do.
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=485s)** — If you're not in ketosis, there is a certain condition. If they forget their medication and
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=491s)** — they don't take insulin and their blood sugars go too high, then the body can develop
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=495s)** — a different type of ketosis, which is like a dangerous type of ketosis.
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=500s)** — People mix them together and say all of ketosis is bad, which is not true. Our bodies were
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=506s)** — designed to not have to eat every hour and a half. So our bodies were designed to be in
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=511s)** — ketosis. Even when we're born, we're going through the ketosis. So there's going to be some
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=516s)** — vested interest against that. And they're going to put out all sorts of things about
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=520s)** — ketosis. Mainly they'll say something like, well, yes, ketosis does work and it does help
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=524s)** — lose weight. But we don't know what's going to happen long term. Well, just a little bit
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=529s)** — of doubt in people's minds. And then they're discouraged. The bottom line is anyone can jump
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=534s)** — on the keto diet and do it. And there's no health risk really. This is what you're saying
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=539s)** — here, right? The risk is not doing it, especially since most people have what's called
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=545s)** — insulin resistance. That's a condition where you've eaten carbs for so long chronically
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=551s)** — your body is now having a... it's almost like a pre-diabetic situation where you can't use
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=559s)** — insulin as well. It's not working. And so then you get all sorts of problems like a fatty liver
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=565s)** — and you're overweight in your midsection. It starts swelling and the heart suffers,
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=570s)** — the brain suffers. Also a dirty keto people go on. They kind of like go to McDonald's and
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=574s)** — they'll just eat the meat without the bun. And that's fine as a step up. But the way that I
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=581s)** — teach people to do it is to do it the healthy version. And it's okay if someone goes off the
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=587s)** — ketogenic diet. It's actually sometimes good to remind themselves of what they feel like.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=591s)** — Like for me, it took me a long time to change my diet because I love junk food, especially
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=598s)** — Doritos and chips. And so I had to go back and forth and back and forth to the point
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=604s)** — where I'm like, you know what? I don't want to feel bad anymore. I'm just going to keep
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=607s)** — consistent. Rarely do I ever go off just because I like the way I feel without it.
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=613s)** — Why is a McDonald's burger with no bun dirty keto? What does that even mean?
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=617s)** — That means like you're using the lower quality of calories on the ketogenic diet. For example,
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=623s)** — keto diet is not necessarily high fat. Like people think they can eat more fat and go into
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=630s)** — ketosis. No, no. The way you get into ketosis by lowering your carbohydrates.
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=634s)** — Okay. So now, of course, you have to replace those carbohydrates with something. So that's
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=639s)** — fat. Now, when people do like seed oils and like you can go and fry something in like
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=646s)** — corn oil and it's still keto because it's low carb, but is it the healthy version?
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=652s)** — Maybe not. So there's different levels of quality of ingredients. Like you look at the
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=660s)** — right. It's just filled with soy protein isolates. That's like pretty low quality protein.
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=667s)** — Yeah, it's keto, but is it healthy? I wouldn't think so.
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=673s)** — To your point here about getting the healthy carbohydrates, you actually live on a farm,
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=678s)** — right? So you're growing these carbohydrates and non-carbohydrates. So just tell me about
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=686s)** — that. I have the fortunate option to live on a farm. I lived in Bethesda for, actually,
- **[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=695s)** — Alexandria for many years. And after a while, after 30 years, I was like, you know what?
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=701s)** — We need to kind of move into a location where there's more space. We actually live off the
- **[11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=706s)** — land. I have gardens. I have animals. We eat the meat. So that's, I'm lucky in that way
- **[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=713s)** — I can actually have a freezer full of meat from my farm and control that. But you don't
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=720s)** — necessarily have to live on a farm to be healthy. You could get this high quality
- **[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=723s)** — protein anywhere. But that's basically where I live. And I have a little studio that I'm in
- **[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=728s)** — right now. I do my videos and basically one video every single day. And we have like 5,700
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=734s)** — videos that I've done. So yeah, that's pretty much what I'm up to lately.
- **[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=738s)** — How is it that we got to this place where I guess we forgot what good food was?
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=745s)** — You know, I interviewed, I released a video today, I interviewed my father who's 87 years
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=750s)** — old. And I started interviewing him. I'm like, what did they eat back then? And how can we
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=754s)** — compare that to now? Did they have food allergies? No. Did they have autism? No.
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=758s)** — Was there anyone that was overweight? No. Was there any diabetes? No. Like you didn't even
- **[12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=763s)** — have these problems. And so one of the conclusions that I came up with is there has been a new
- **[12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=771s)** — category of food that was invented or created or manufactured by the food industry called the
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=778s)** — snack food and snack foods. So we have the crackers, the chips, the little bars,
- **[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=784s)** — the snack bars. I mean, back then, your parents would tell you not to ruin your appetite.
- **[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=789s)** — If they did have a snack, it was like an apple or something out of the garden. Now, we snack
- **[13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=796s)** — not on that. We snack on ultra processed food calories. So we're dealing with highly refined
- **[13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=801s)** — things that are just going to raise our insulin between the meals. So now we have three meals
- **[13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=806s)** — and then we add the snacks. Now we get these spikes all day long and we're creating a
- **[13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=812s)** — chronic insulin situation, which is literally destroying our health at a very early age.
- **[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=819s)** — I remember asking my father, I said, What kind of cereal did you have? Oatmeal with milk. That
- **[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=823s)** — was it. There wasn't these cereals that they have now. How is it that this actually happened?
- **[13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=829s)** — Because it's not just the reality of the junk food, but it's the actual guidance,
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=835s)** — to some extent, too. You remember when tobacco was considered healthy, and people smoked. And
- **[14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=842s)** — so that went over a period of time. And then there was a shift where smoking was bad.
- **[14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=847s)** — Cigarette manufacturing companies shifted gears, and they bought up some of the junk food
- **[14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=853s)** — industry. And then he started producing more food that was very profitable. If you take, for
- **[14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=859s)** — example, one ingredient, corn, the type of corn they use in junk food is not sweet corn.
- **[14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=866s)** — They use what's called dent corn or field corn. It's inedible. You can't even eat it.
- **[14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=871s)** — But that's the corn that's in the chips. It's in most of the products. Because of the
- **[14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=876s)** — subsidies, they basically can buy a cubic ton of this corn for $198. Okay. Now think about how
- **[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=886s)** — many boxes of corn flakes you can make for under 200 bucks. So you have a super cheap
- **[14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=894s)** — food that gives you a lot of pleasure at the expense of no nutrition, very little protein.
- **[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=901s)** — So it's going to keep you eating it. My problem was the Doritos. I could just start
- **[15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=905s)** — out with the whole bag. I mean, a large bag in one sitting without even thinking twice. So
- **[15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=910s)** — we created this industry and it's created addictions. 40, 50 years later, here we are
- **[15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=918s)** — with the problem. And unfortunately, you as a taxpayer pays for most of the raw material in
- **[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=924s)** — this junk food unknowingly through the subsidies. And that's something that has to be cleaned up
- **[15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=930s)** — by this new administration. Let's talk about this new administration. But before we go there,
- **[15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=935s)** — just to finish off the first question, somehow a high carbohydrate diet became kind of what we
- **[15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=944s)** — were supposed to do. And so is that just pure lobbying? Or how did that happen?
- **[15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=950s)** — It's pure profit because you have to make profit on things that have no shelf life.
- **[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=955s)** — I mean, let's just take beef, for example, the margins on beef is like 3%. So why would
- **[16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=961s)** — want to get into the beef business, right? If you look at junk food, if you take a look at
- **[16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=965s)** — just profit, they make about $260 billion a year just on the starches. And an average
- **[16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=972s)** — person consumes about 250 to 300 pounds of starch every single year. Whereas the sugars
- **[16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=977s)** — is like, they might make it's like 10 billion. It doesn't even compare. Yeah,
- **[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=983s)** — people consume about 150 pounds of sugar a year. But starches are like, that's something
- **[16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=989s)** — people don't talk about. So I think if we are going to make some changes, we have to, first of
- **[16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=994s)** — all, make people aware of these hidden ingredients and start to get them out of your diet.
- **[16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1001s)** — The other thing I noticed is that if there's these hidden, basically farm subsidies, right,
- **[16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1008s)** — in the system, if you're going to start taking apart the system, you're actually going
- **[16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1013s)** — to impact America's farmers. Those farmers, I think played a big role in
- **[16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1018s)** — getting this administration elected. I think what we should do is reward the small farmer,
- **[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1023s)** — because they're being put out of business and support them, and maybe subsidize the farmers
- **[17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1028s)** — that are doing it right with healthier foods, rather than the large industrial farms that are
- **[17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1034s)** — just literally producing the lowest quality food you could imagine. What about large farms
- **[17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1043s)** — that produce higher quality food, because there must be a range? Yeah, there's a total
- **[17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1047s)** — range. And Cornucopia is a great activist group that I support. And they have a food scoring
- **[17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1055s)** — system that they'll look at these farms and they talk about who's doing right,
- **[17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1059s)** — who's not doing it right. Because they find these loopholes and they try to cheat the
- **[17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1063s)** — system and it's called organic, but is it really organic? So they're really trying to
- **[17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1067s)** — keep the integrity, at least in the organic sphere. There's going to be a lot more transparency,
- **[17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1074s)** — because the largest privately owned company in the United States, I won't even say the name,
- **[18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1082s)** — that's the company that makes most of the starches in the seed oils, and some of the
- **[18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1088s)** — sugars too. And they're a privately owned company. And so they don't have to disclose
- **[18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1093s)** — certain things. What is the promise of this new administration for me, in your view?
- **[18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1099s)** — R.F.K. is a non-politician. He's going to be a really good person to get in there to
- **[18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1106s)** — cut the umbilical cords between the cozy relationships and the conflict of interest
- **[18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1112s)** — between industry and the government. Right now, the food guidelines are associated between
- **[18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1119s)** — who has the strongest lobbyists. And so there's too much influence from industry
- **[18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1124s)** — in our food system, in our medical system, in the research of drugs. He's going to clean that
- **[18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1131s)** — up. And of course, they're going to attack him for this. But it's going to be a really
- **[18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1136s)** — vital change to remove this conflict of interest and have more transparency. So we can actually
- **[19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1143s)** — focus more on the root causes of health issues, support the smaller farmer and make it
- **[19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1149s)** — for our generation to be healthy. Because right now, it's getting worse. The food guidelines
- **[19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1155s)** — is so important because it trickles down into the school system, the hospitals, the assisted
- **[19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1161s)** — living home. There's an individual I know who has um, he's in Arizona. He owns four assisted
- **[19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1166s)** — living homes. Okay. And what's really interesting about him is he changes the diet. He doesn't
- **[19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1173s)** — allow junk food. And these people are coming in from places like hospice and his rate of
- **[19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1179s)** — reducing medications through the help of their online doctor or their doctor that's on site,
- **[19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1184s)** — it's like 47%. So you go in there with certain medications and then you're coming out
- **[19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1188s)** — with almost half of those medications. So he told me this, and this is really fascinating
- **[19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1194s)** — that the software that he uses to coordinate between the medical doctor and the medications
- **[20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1200s)** — is owned by a CEO that I told him to contact the CEO. And I want to know on average, what's
- **[20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1209s)** — the average number of medications that these patients are on? So he did that for me.
- **[20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1214s)** — And you're not going to believe what he said. He took a hundred people, random people out
- **[20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1217s)** — of his database. And he works with people all over the United States in these assisted
- **[20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1221s)** — living homes. And he found a range between 91 medications to 42 medications with an average
- **[20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1228s)** — of 48 medications. He sent me a document with one patient on 48 medications. Okay. I look
- **[20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1237s)** — through this. I almost vomited because I'm like, you got to be kidding me. An average person
- **[20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1243s)** — going to an assisted living homes on 48 medications. I mean, this is like outrageous.
- **[20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1248s)** — This is insane. So why wouldn't we want someone like Bobby Kennedy to go in there
- **[20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1253s)** — straighten this up to improve this, to get people to start eating real food all over the place?
- **[21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1260s)** — I remember thinking that too, in the past, that it's so bizarre that the food you get in
- **[21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1265s)** — hospitals, you know, isn't really a very high quality. You would think it like nutritionally,
- **[21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1270s)** — you would, you might want that, right? I lived in Thailand for a couple of years where
- **[21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1274s)** — medical tourism is a popular thing, except that it's sort of like a five-star hotel
- **[21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1280s)** — experience, right? That's part of what you pay for is doing whatever the medical procedure you
- **[21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1285s)** — want. And they just, they feed you really well. And I thought, man, this is very different
- **[21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1289s)** — from the hospital food I've seen, right? I know. Like I wanted for surgery and
- **[21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1295s)** — I was like, do you have any protein? No, we have Jell-O crock. So I'm like,
- **[21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1299s)** — I need protein. Can you, I mean, it's sickening, like especially with before surgery
- **[21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1304s)** — and after the surgery, like you need actual food. It does seem crazy on the face of it that
- **[21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1313s)** — there's the average number across 100 random people in, you know, elder care facilities.
- **[22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1321s)** — An average person would be on 48 medications. That seems astonishingly high. However,
- **[22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1328s)** — well, you know, presumably they need some of those medications. So you're arguing there's an
- **[22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1336s)** — over-prescription scenario happening here. I mean, just like the question is,
- **[22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1343s)** — did you bring up food? Are you using food in your equation when you're diagnosing? How do
- **[22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1348s)** — you know what is causing what? Are you looking at the side effects from the medications? Maybe
- **[22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1353s)** — you're just treating the side effects of the medication with another medication, and we go
- **[22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1356s)** — around and around. When you treat symptoms and not real causes, you don't really improve the
- **[22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1361s)** — health. So like even your blood sugars, right? You take a medication to lower your blood
- **[22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1365s)** — sugars. Where do you think that's going? Where do you think that sugar is going? Is it
- **[22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1369s)** — evaporating? It's you're just changing one problem. You're shifting it to another part of
- **[22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1374s)** — the body. Especially there's something called iatrogenic disease. I don't know if you've
- **[22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1378s)** — ever heard of that. That's medication caused disease. That's like number three, as far as
- **[23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1384s)** — the top leading causes of death is iatrogenic is number three. So the question is, I think,
- **[23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1392s)** — especially with the antibiotics and steroids and things like that, it should be reevaluated.
- **[23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1397s)** — The system is unworkable. There are medical doctors, I guess the bottom line is that do
- **[23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1403s)** — look at causes and not just symptoms. But the default is to look at the symptoms. Is
- **[23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1409s)** — that a right way to characterize? There's more and more doctors are looking at the whole body,
- **[23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1416s)** — even endocrinologists that I know that I'm friends with that are looking at the diet,
- **[23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1420s)** — because there's just a kind of a disconnect. They refer anything related to food to the
- **[23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1426s)** — dietitian. But then they don't have control of that. So I think the new trend is going
- **[23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1433s)** — to be looking at the whole body. And so they're not just stuck in this managing the
- **[23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1438s)** — symptom model. Just like if you take an engineer and an engineer looks at this logically,
- **[24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1443s)** — like they're going to go, wait, what's wrong with this? No, what's the mechanism? What's
- **[24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1448s)** — underneath it? Like, do we ever take people off the medication? What's the plan? What's the
- **[24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1452s)** — long term plan? There's a lot of people that are interested in weight loss right now.
- **[24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1457s)** — And there's these very popular new drugs, which a lot of people are going on. They're
- **[24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1461s)** — actually working for people. If someone is interested in weight loss, where should people look first?
- **[24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1469s)** — Well, I think if we look at just weight loss by itself, there's just one thing you need to know
- **[24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1473s)** — about how the body stores fat. And that has to do with the hormone insulin. So if you want to
- **[24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1479s)** — lose weight, you got to keep that insulin low. So there's two ways to do it. One is to lower
- **[24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1485s)** — your carbohydrates, and that would be the sugars and starches. But the other way too,
- **[24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1489s)** — is you can also do a different thing, which is to do intermittent fasting, start skipping
- **[24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1495s)** — breakfast and having two meals and not the snacks. So if you go longer without the snacks,
- **[25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1501s)** — what you're going to find is you'll go into ketosis, your appetite will go down.
- **[25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1506s)** — And we're not even talking about lowering calories. We're just talking about not eating
- **[25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1510s)** — so frequently. You can lose a lot of weight like that because every time you eat, you
- **[25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1516s)** — raise insulin, regardless of what you eat. So it's very important to know that. And the
- **[25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1525s)** — takes is a little bit of carbohydrate to bump you out of ketosis for a longer period of time,
- **[25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1531s)** — like sometimes up to 48 hours. So that half a glass of wine or that toast, you kind of have
- **[25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1539s)** — to now wait for a day and a half to two days before you get back in the ketosis. So
- **[25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1545s)** — a lot of people are saying, well, I'm trying it, but it's not working. And then you ask
- **[25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1549s)** — them what they're doing. They're like, well, yeah, I do have a little bit of something in
- **[25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1552s)** — the meals. I'm like, okay, so just do intermittent fasting, watch what happens. And it finally works
- **[25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1557s)** — for them. If you try to do a diet with higher in carbs, it's torture because you're trying to
- **[26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1562s)** — lose weight with hunger and cravings. I mean, that's hard. You're going to at night, you're
- **[26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1566s)** — like looking at the cupboard and like, oh my gosh, I need some carbs, right? So
- **[26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1572s)** — it will make it easier. Yes, it does take discipline. But I think the best thing to do is
- **[26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1576s)** — don't have it in the house or it can tempt you. I want to touch on a few things which
- **[26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1581s)** — you, I guess, recommend. I don't know how broadly. But one of the things that we've
- **[26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1588s)** — discussed before privately is vitamin D. I discovered it really as such an important
- **[26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1593s)** — thing during the COVID-19 pandemic, where people with higher levels of vitamin D just had
- **[26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1598s)** — a lot better outcomes on average. Vitamin D is the most important vitamin because it's
- **[26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1606s)** — involved in 10% of all of our genes. That's like over 2500 genes. Think about how bass that
- **[26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1615s)** — is, right? Everything from the immune system to the brain to inflammation to your bones. So
- **[27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1621s)** — it's not just about bones, absorbing calcium for bones. It's about a lot of different things.
- **[27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1627s)** — The question is, can you get enough vitamin D from the diet? No, you can't. It's impossible.
- **[27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1631s)** — You can get it from the sun. But think about what happened in the 80s. We or someone had this idea
- **[27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1638s)** — that we should stay out of the sun because sun causes skin cancer. We became sun phobic.
- **[27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1644s)** — And even nowadays, it's hard to find even kids outside. What we really need as a maintenance
- **[27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1649s)** — dosage on a daily basis to maintain all of the systems in the body with just as a
- **[27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1656s)** — dose is 10,000. I use a vitamin D3. Very few people know that and very few people are doing
- **[27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1662s)** — that. They're using the outdated information that was only researched about with your bones,
- **[27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1670s)** — preventing rickets, which is like soft bones in children. And they're not looking at all this
- **[27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1676s)** — amazing research. And I think because the amount of competition with medications is very
- **[28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1681s)** — high. Because if you take a look at vitamin D, what it can do for inflammation, what it can do
- **[28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1686s)** — for autoimmune, what it can do for respiratory infections, what it can do for insulin issues.
- **[28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1693s)** — It's literally amazing when you dive into the research. I think I have over 280 videos in
- **[28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1697s)** — vitamin D. So I am like very interested in this topic because it's the lowest hanging fruit
- **[28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1704s)** — if you want to get someone healthy. Really. It's like if you just give them vitamin D
- **[28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1708s)** — for so many issues, they can actually improve. It's inexpensive. You could use the sun if it's
- **[28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1714s)** — summer. But if not, it's not that expensive as a modality, you know, a treatment.
- **[28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1721s)** — What about turmeric? Okay. So turmeric has this active ingredient called curcumin.
- **[28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1728s)** — Out of all of the herbal remedies, that one is the most research. It has the most broad
- **[28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1734s)** — spectrum effects of anything. That is probably on the scale of importance is that's like a really
- **[29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1741s)** — top herb that can literally do so many things. And I think because it can grow in very
- **[29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1749s)** — dehydrated environments. And so that plant has adapted for hundreds of thousands of years to
- **[29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1755s)** — create these amazing defense mechanisms and these properties of survival that we can then
- **[29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1760s)** — consume and it helps our bodies in many different ways, especially as an anti-inflammatory.
- **[29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1767s)** — I would highly recommend including that in your diet on a regular basis. You can do it through
- **[29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1771s)** — curries or the teas. Curiously, in Polish, the word for turmeric is kurkuma. I'm a native
- **[29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1780s)** — speaker. That's what I keep thinking as you say it. And I might add it's delicious. It's
- **[29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1791s)** — I'm always the kind of guy that if it's a little as good, a lot of better. No, not with
- **[29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1796s)** — turmeric. There's definitely a limit and you don't want to get it on your shirt.
- **[30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1801s)** — Oh, yes. I grew it and then I dried it out and I started to eat it through the day,
- **[30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1806s)** — like for several days in a row. I was just eating it constantly.
- **[30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1810s)** — Got sick. You don't need much. Just have a little bit.
- **[30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1816s)** — You help people with basically fatigue and so forth. You must have a broad approach to
- **[30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1827s)** — dealing with that. When you take a symptom like fatigue, that can come from a lot of
- **[30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1833s)** — different things. So the first question I always ask is like, what are you eating?
- **[30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1837s)** — But as far as nutrients go, there's a really important nutrient that people know about,
- **[30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1843s)** — but they don't really connect it to fatigue. But if you go into the cells, the energy
- **[30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1848s)** — factory of the cell, the mitochondria, which is a very important part of the cell,
- **[30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1853s)** — in order to make energy, the last little part of that requires magnesium. And it's a little
- **[31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1860s)** — motor that spins. It's an enzyme that spins like 400 times a second. It's like the most
- **[31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1867s)** — amazing little motor and it's in your body and it's working to make what's called ATP
- **[31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1871s)** — and it requires magnesium. So yes, magnesium people take for leg cramps and to sleep and
- **[31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1877s)** — for stress, but energy, you should take a magnesium for energy because if you take
- **[31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1882s)** — vitamin D, that's the most important. The second one is magnesium. Magnesium is almost
- **[31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1887s)** — impossible to test because most of the magnesium is inside the tissues. It's not in the blood.
- **[31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1893s)** — Only 1% of it's in the blood. So you have to have a special test and no one gets that.
- **[31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1898s)** — It's something that's also very commonly deficient. And the one that I would recommend
- **[31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1901s)** — is something like a magnesium glycinate because that's the one that won't cause
- **[31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1906s)** — diarrhea and it gets absorbed 80%. You take it right before bed. And great for muscle stuff,
- **[31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1914s)** — sleeping. Apparently it's good for sleeping, but then it's also good for energy.
- **[31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1919s)** — Yeah, right. Well, you know what? It takes energy to sleep, which is interesting.
- **[32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1922s)** — Some people are too tired to actually rest. So they're laying down, they're restless,
- **[32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1928s)** — and they just can't get into a relaxed state. What about the super foods? What is the top
- **[32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1934s)** — super food in your mind? I think this is going to surprise you because when people think
- **[32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1939s)** — they drink the green drinks, right? But there's a much higher level of super food that has
- **[32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1947s)** — virtually every nutrient, very bioavailable. And it's actually red meat. Red meat. People
- **[32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1954s)** — are going to say, Oh my gosh, I thought that was like, it's just like processed meat. No,
- **[32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1957s)** — I'm talking about grass fed red meat, whether it's beef or it's lamb. I mean, it has so
- **[32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1963s)** — many nutrients, iron and B12. And plus the protein is the highest quality. It's even
- **[32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1970s)** — better than eggs because it has better omega-3 ratios. And so it's really a good healing food.
- **[32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1977s)** — People have gone on to the plant proteins, and they're not going to feel as good. So
- **[33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1981s)** — it's high quality protein. Most of our body is protein. And that would be something that
- **[33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1987s)** — a person would notice immediately a difference. Eric, final thought as we finish?
- **[33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=1994s)** — I think my final thought on this would be instead of this huge focus on treating disease
- **[33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=2000s)** — and focusing on getting rid of disease, let's start to focus on creating our health.
- **[33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=2006s)** — It's a different question. It's a different model. Instead of waiting until you get a
- **[33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=2010s)** — disease and treating it, let's prevent that by looking at common, simple things that you can
- **[33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=2017s)** — do to lifestyle changes that involve, at the real essence of it, eating real food. That's the
- **[33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=2024s)** — most important thing you can do. Well, Eric Berg, it's such a pleasure to have had you on.
- **[33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or7kKNlMlDY&t=2028s)** — Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
