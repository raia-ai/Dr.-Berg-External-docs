- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the dark side of taking testosterone.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=4s)** — Disclaimer, I'm not telling you to stop taking your testosterone.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=7s)** — I'm not telling you that you shouldn't take testosterone.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=10s)** — There are definitely positive benefits from testosterone.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=13s)** — Increasing your libido, increasing your energy, your state of well-being, muscle strength.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=19s)** — What about the negatives? What things should you be aware of?
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=23s)** — We have the hypothalamus in our brain that communicates with the pituitary
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=26s)** — that then sends signals down to the testicle that makes testosterone.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=30s)** — Once you have enough testosterone, the testosterone kind of signals back
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=36s)** — to turn off that pituitary and hypothalamus so we don't keep having more and more of these hormones.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=42s)** — When you start taking testosterone, you're basically sending signals to these other glands in your brain
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=50s)** — to tell it to turn off. And so your testicles don't have to make any more testosterone.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=54s)** — So they go into a retirement. Now, is that permanent?
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=58s)** — It really depends on a lot of factors. How long you've taken it. Your genetics.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=62s)** — Why would some men have these symptoms, yet not other men?
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=67s)** — Alright, number one, it can worsen your sleep apnea.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=71s)** — Number two, it can affect your mood. You can get moody, cause acne, create dizziness.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=76s)** — It can also potentially cause a heart attack.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=79s)** — It can decrease fertility, not that most older men want another child.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=85s)** — And also thicker blood. And I think the biggest side effect is testicular atrophy.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=90s)** — It means that the testicles now get smaller and smaller and smaller.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=93s)** — It can cause a loss of erections. So when you take testosterone for a long period of time,
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=100s)** — you can develop a problem in the receptors for testosterone where it doesn't work as well anymore.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=106s)** — Number four, if we take a look at specifically age-related hypogonadism,
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=113s)** — that means your testicles are not functioning as well as they should.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=116s)** — And you may say, well, it's just old age. Not with everyone.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=120s)** — There's younger men that are getting this more and more and more.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=124s)** — At the top of the list, if you have insulin resistance, that can definitely be a problem.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=129s)** — Number two, lower amount of zinc.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=131s)** — Zinc is involved with hundreds of different enzymes.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=136s)** — In fact, sperm has a very high concentration of zinc to help the survival of the sperm connect with the egg.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=144s)** — Another cause would be the person is protein deficient. They are not consuming enough protein.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=151s)** — This next one is interesting. Low-fat diets. Why?
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=155s)** — Because cholesterol is the precursor to make testosterone.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=162s)** — Statins also can cause lowered amount of testosterone. Why?
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=166s)** — Because statin blocks your production of cholesterol.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=171s)** — Another one would be high soy diet. Another one is low vitamin A or low vitamin D.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=179s)** — Overtraining. Probably because it increases cortisol.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=183s)** — Insomnia and then also liver issues and inability to get rid of iron.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=188s)** — Obesity. Because your fat cells release aromatase to convert testosterone to estrogen.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=198s)** — Now that you know that, what do you do now to increase your testosterone?
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=202s)** — Weight training. It will really help you increase your testosterone.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=206s)** — Number two, zinc. I would recommend both taking zinc and also consuming foods high in zinc.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=211s)** — Shellfish, red meat, liver. Very important.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=216s)** — Number three, vitamin D.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=217s)** — Number four, having sufficient amount of fat in your diet.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=222s)** — The butter, the meats. As long as you keep your carbs low.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=227s)** — Some of you out there listening are like, wow, I can't have saturated fats.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=232s)** — I cannot consume that much cholesterol because either my cholesterol is high or my doctor said not to do it.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=238s)** — And you might be in doubt about that. You might be concerned because of all the confusion out there.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=244s)** — And so if it was so bad, why does our bodies make it?
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=248s)** — DHEA might be a good supplement for you to help substantiate or fortify your adrenals.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=254s)** — So that your adrenals can get some relief and make some more hormones.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=258s)** — So you have some extra material for making testosterone.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=264s)** — The other really important thing is getting enough REM sleep.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=268s)** — So the non-REM sleep is like the deep delta wave sleep.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=271s)** — And then the higher waves are the REM sleep. It's the rapid eye movement.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=276s)** — And if you're losing more REM sleep, you won't have the level of testosterone.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=281s)** — So this is why sleep is really important for your testosterone as well.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=285s)** — We have videos on all sorts of things to help you sleep.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=288s)** — And I will put a very specific recent video I did down below in the description.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=293s)** — Next one is just losing weight in general. Why?
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=296s)** — Because when you have less fat cells, you have less aromatase, an enzyme,
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=302s)** — that is converting your testosterone to estrogen.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=305s)** — If you're just starting out kind of a big person, over time when you lose weight,
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=311s)** — you will have more and more testosterone.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=314s)** — And so if you want to know how to lose weight, I'll put that link down below as well.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=317s)** — And the next one is kind of just optimizing your blood sugars,
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=320s)** — getting rid of this insulin resistance.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=322s)** — And that's done with the ketogenic diet, as well as doing intermittent fasting.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=327s)** — And the last one I kind of already mentioned, having sufficient amount of protein
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=332s)** — to optimize your level of testosterone. That's what we really want to do.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=336s)** — We want to just bring it to a level where everything works fine.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=340s)** — And if you do that, maybe you actually don't need to add testosterone
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=346s)** — because it comes with a package.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=347s)** — Thanks for watching. And I think the best video to watch next is this one on cholesterol.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=354s)** — Very important. It's about LDL. And you should know this data.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSZ-T2V--Rg&t=358s)** — I put it up right here. Check it out.
