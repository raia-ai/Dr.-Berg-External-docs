- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=0s)** — So here we have this natural herb called wormwood or it's called artemisinin. Okay,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=6s)** — now it's been used for well over 2,000 years as part of Chinese medicine. It's been very,
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=12s)** — very effective with a lot of different things. Antimicrobial, especially anti-malaria. But then
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=18s)** — they found a way to synthesize it and to make it synthetically. And then all of a sudden the
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=24s)** — effectiveness of this natural herb went way down as far as using the natural version.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=29s)** — They'll say that it's not very bioavailable, expensive, it doesn't work as good as a drug,
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=34s)** — which it may not work as good as a drug, but it's been used for over 2,000 years.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=41s)** — So it's stood the test of time. And today I want to talk about how amazing this plant is.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=46s)** — And if you're going to grow your own natural pharmacy, this is definitely one to put on the
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=50s)** — list to grow. But right now the synthetic version is the most effective treatment for
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=55s)** — Apparently it can actually stop the different stages of this malarial parasite. But Wormwood
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=62s)** — is very effective for worms. It's good for viruses, anti-viral, bacteria. And there's some
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=70s)** — interesting research, which I'll put down below on what it can do for COVID. And it's a
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=75s)** — pretty potent anti-lime. You know, this little parasitic spiral kite that you can get from
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=80s)** — a tick bite. But today I'm going to talk a little bit more about its potent effectiveness
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=86s)** — for cancer. And I don't know why, but a lot of these remedies for worms and parasites,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=93s)** — and even viruses, also tend to parallel for cancer. And Wormwood is at the top of the list
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=100s)** — because it does some really interesting things in relationship to cancer. The first thing that
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=104s)** — I want to talk about is in its ability to selectively cause something called apoptosis
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=112s)** — to the cancer cells. Now, first of all, the word selectively, that means that it targets the
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=117s)** — cancer cells, not your own cells. That's pretty cool. And now what does this apoptosis mean?
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=124s)** — That means that the cell commits suicide. Okay, it kills itself. And so Wormwood has the
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=131s)** — cause the cancer cell commits suicide because normally it doesn't do that. It lives forever.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=137s)** — It has a limited lifespan. But Wormwood can actually cause apoptosis in cancer cells,
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=142s)** — both in the lab and a little petri dish, as well as in animal studies. Now, it's studying
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=148s)** — different mechanisms of how it actually can deal with cancer. And I want to talk about it
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=158s)** — It'll take a little bit of your own iron from your red blood cell and cause that iron to
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=167s)** — oxidize, turning it into a free radical and directing it to the cancer cell itself.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=173s)** — Now, this is another mechanism of how it can kill a parasite or a worm. It's through this
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=178s)** — iron oxidation effect. When iron tends to go into that oxidation form, it's very toxic to
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=186s)** — cells, especially cancer cells. Now, the other thing that it can do... and before I get into
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=193s)** — that, I want to just explain one thing about cancer. Cancer cells come from normal cells.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=199s)** — So a normal cell can switch over to a cancer cell when there's damage to the mitochondria.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=207s)** — There's this protein complex called HIF. And without getting too technical, it's this factor
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=217s)** — that involves hypoxia. Hypoxia is a lack of oxygen. So apparently it's this factor,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=223s)** — or this protein complex, that triggers this switch from a normal cell to a cancer cell.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=230s)** — So anything that can inhibit this switching, I think, would be important when dealing with
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=235s)** — cancer. Especially if you have cancer and you want to avoid more of the normal cells
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=240s)** — converting over to cancer. So it just so happens that the phytonutrients and wormwood
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=245s)** — have the ability to inhibit this protein complex. And it's also interesting that hypoxia
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=252s)** — is involved, which explains a lot. Because inflammation, for example, is one trigger.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=257s)** — Because when you have inflammation, you have less oxygen. But apparently there's other things
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=261s)** — that can trigger cancer that go beyond just hypoxia. But the cool thing is that wormwood
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=267s)** — has the ability to inhibit this compound. Also, wormwood has another mechanism of inhibiting
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=277s)** — the normal cells from producing this increase in blood vessels to the tumor. So one thing that
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=285s)** — cancer does is it recruits blood supply from your normal cells. And it causes your normal
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=292s)** — cells to produce blood vessels into the tumor. So this is just one little trick that these
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=298s)** — cancer cells do. Well, wormwood is anti-angiogenic. So it can help diminish that mechanism.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=306s)** — Now, wormwood is also highly anti-inflammatory. So just by addressing inflammation, you can
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=313s)** — stop the spread of cancer as well as the formation of cancer too. Especially
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=318s)** — since there's this link between inflammation and cancer. And some people are using wormwood for
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=323s)** — autoimmune because autoimmune is an inflammatory problem. And the last thing involving cancer
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=329s)** — that wormwood can help a person with, it has an anti-menostatic effect. Which basically means
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=336s)** — it inhibits the growth of cancer, which is pretty cool. But anyway, I just wanted to share
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=341s)** — some of the interesting effects of this plant that anyone can actually grow in their garden
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=345s)** — or their greenhouse and the amazing properties it might have in potentially helping you.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=352s)** — Now, since we're on the topic of natural remedies, if you haven't seen my video on garlic,
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIvFURdGEVE&t=357s)** — that's pretty cool. I put it up right here. Check it out.
