- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=0s)** — You know, at one time I had zero awareness about the importance of vitamins and what they did on our bodies.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=9s)** — Especially vitamin D. I maybe heard about it, maybe you get it from the sun, from the foods.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=14s)** — I just had zero data on vitamin D and it just wasn't even on my radar. But over time,
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=20s)** — when I gained more knowledge about vitamin D, it is the most important vitamin out of all the
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=26s)** — because if you're deficient, boy, your immune system doesn't work, you're going to have inflammation,
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=31s)** — you can have all sorts of issues with sleep and digestion, and the list goes on and on and on.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=36s)** — But they may know some of the common reasons why the majority of the population is deficient
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=40s)** — in vitamin D. Gut inflammation, no gallbladder. As we age, our skin becomes thicker. We can't
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=48s)** — absorb vitamin D from the sun. The darker the skin is, the less vitamin D absorption because
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=53s)** — the melanin, the pigment in the skin, the more obese someone is, the more diabetic they are,
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=60s)** — the more insulin resistance they have, the less vitamin D they're going to absorb.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=63s)** — And also where they live. If they live at a high latitude in the north, they're not going
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=69s)** — to get much D. And it's virtually impossible to get vitamin D from your diet. People are
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=74s)** — also more aware that their genetics have a big play in vitamin D too. There are many
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=78s)** — different genes that a person can have a problem with that either makes it difficult to
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=82s)** — convert into the active form of vitamin D or just absorb vitamin D. And I have that problem
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=89s)** — myself. Then you have if a person has an infection, microbes can downgrade vitamin D
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=95s)** — receptors and block the absorption of vitamin D as their strategy to overcome your immune
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=99s)** — system. If someone has a fatty liver or they smoke or they consume sugar or they go through
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=106s)** — stress, they're going to absorb less vitamin D. If they're on a statin or on a low-fat diet,
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=112s)** — they're not going to get as much vitamin D. If there's pollution in the air, or even if
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=117s)** — they're getting too many omega-6 fatty acids with the soy oil, the corn oil, the canola oil,
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=121s)** — that will block vitamin D. But I want to talk about seven things that you probably have never
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=126s)** — heard of before. And they're very interesting and they're very important to know. Number one,
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=133s)** — the majority of side effects that may occur when you take vitamin D. Okay, and I'm going to list
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=139s)** — them. Fatigue, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, skin rash, nausea, headache, pain, all could
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=149s)** — occur if you're low in magnesium. Magnesium is such an important mineral in relationship to
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=156s)** — vitamin D. It helps it work better. And if you're deficient in magnesium, which a lot
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=160s)** — people are, vitamin D may give you additional issues. So in other words, if you take more
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=166s)** — vitamin D, it can exaggerate an already deficient situation with magnesium. Now, of
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=173s)** — course, the side effect from very large amounts of vitamin D over many, many months,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=179s)** — potentially creating hypercalcemia, could give you kidney stones. But this is very, very rare.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=186s)** — And this, I think, is probably the biggest fear. They don't realize that you'd have to take a
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=191s)** — lot more over a long period of time before you got kidney stones or hypercalcemia. And if you're
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=196s)** — taking magnesium and other factors related to this vitamin D, like K2, the odds of you
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=203s)** — getting hypercalcemia, too much calcium in the blood, even go even lower. But drinking
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=209s)** — a little bit more water, like 2.5 liters of fluid per day, can really almost eliminate the
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=214s)** — kidney stones. Because kidney stones form when there's a super concentrated amount of this
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=220s)** — calcium in the urine. So if your urine is so diluted, it can never be super concentrated.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=226s)** — Number two, taking vitamin D infrequently works a little bit better than on a regular
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=234s)** — basis. So if we compare taking 10,000 I use of vitamin D every day as a maintenance dose,
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=239s)** — and you instead did 50,000 I use once a week or twice a week, that might work a little better
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=247s)** — for you. And this is good because sometimes people forget to take vitamin D and they think,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=251s)** — is it going to do any good if I take it a few times a week? And the answer is yes. Remember,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=256s)** — vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin. So when it goes in the body, it gets stored in the
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=260s)** — fat cells and it can be released over time. It's not like a water soluble vitamin, like
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=265s)** — the B vitamins and vitamin C, that you would want to take those on a daily basis.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=270s)** — The next thing that people don't realize is this. When you consume like farm raised fish,
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=277s)** — which I mean, it's so, so common in restaurants and you just need to start reading the labels.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=284s)** — Farm raised fish has four times less vitamin D as well caught fish. Grain fed animals
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=291s)** — compared to grass fed animals have much less vitamin D. And chickens and pigs that roam outside
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=301s)** — and that are able to get out of the barn and they're exposed to the sun have much more
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=306s)** — vitamin D than these pigs and chickens that are confined to a structure. In fact, when a
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=313s)** — pig or a chicken doesn't get to see the daylight, they're like three times less vitamin
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=317s)** — D. All right, number four, and this is really, really interesting.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=322s)** — Out of all the factors that can improve your health, okay, vitamin D is behind eating a
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=328s)** — healthy diet and exercise. All right, number five, vitamin D2, which is mainly you have to
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=336s)** — get a prescription for is very different than vitamin D3. In fact, vitamin D2 actually in
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=343s)** — some studies have worsened MS, okay, versus vitamin D3 has greatly improved MS. Lupus,
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=352s)** — another autoimmune disease, is not affected by D2, but it is with D3. The studies in vitamin D2
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=360s)** — do not decrease mortality, but the studies with vitamin D3 do. And taking vitamin D2
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=367s)** — can actually inhibit the absorption of vitamin D3. All right, next point, okay.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=373s)** — Some people when they go out and get exposed to the sun, they think that they're getting
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=378s)** — a lot of vitamin D when they're getting exposed to the sun for like 10 minutes.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=383s)** — So let's say best care scenario, you're young, you don't have any of these other barriers
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=387s)** — of absorption of vitamin D, and you're exposing a lot of your skin to the sun
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=393s)** — for about 10 minutes, you're only going to get 400 IUs of vitamin D. That is very, very
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=401s)** — low amounts. So just realize that it takes a bit more exposure to sun to get enough vitamin D.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=407s)** — All right, and last point that I think is very, very important because a lot of people
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=411s)** — take vitamin D3 and they don't realize that manufacturing companies are adding corn syrup
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=419s)** — to vitamin D. In fact, the manufacturing company that I work with in Europe basically told me with
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=426s)** — a high level of certainty, I was the only one to ask or request a vitamin D product without
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=434s)** — corn syrup. And I would suspect a similar thing is happening in the U.S. but I don't know for
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=439s)** — sure. So when you get a vitamin D product, make sure they don't add the corn syrup or
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=447s)** — maltodextrin. Now that you know those seven factors, I want to take your awareness even
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2DGrgMIcsE&t=452s)** — higher. If you haven't seen this video on vitamin D, you should check it out. I put it up right here.
