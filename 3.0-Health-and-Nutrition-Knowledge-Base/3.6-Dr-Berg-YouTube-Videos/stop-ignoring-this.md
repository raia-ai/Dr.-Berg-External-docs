- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the seven surprising signs that your blood sugar is way too high. The first
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=7s)** — question is can you actually feel high blood sugar? Normally you can't feel too much unless
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=12s)** — it's really really high. You might feel a little fatigued but where the symptoms come in is when
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=17s)** — the blood sugars go down. Take a look at this little graph. Right here we have this little red
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=22s)** — line that goes up and then it comes down past this level line where I wrote 80 on the left
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=28s)** — side and that basically is normal blood sugar. You're not supposed to have a lot. When people
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=33s)** — overeat carbohydrates the blood sugar goes up and insulin is going to do two things. It's going to
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=37s)** — remove the sugar from the blood to help bring down the blood sugar but it's also going to
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=42s)** — open the door in all of your cells to allow this sugar to go in the cell so you can use
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=48s)** — it as fuel. A lot of the symptoms I'm going to talk about are related to a problem with
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=53s)** — low blood sugar and low blood sugar in the actual cell because insulin is not working very well
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=60s)** — anymore. You develop something called resistance and I'm talking about insulin resistance in the
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=64s)** — cell and that's represented in this other image where you have this little key being
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=69s)** — insulin and in the cell you have this little lock in there right? That's the receptor for
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=73s)** — insulin. That key is not fitting into the lock anymore. Then you get all these symptoms
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=78s)** — that I'm going to describe next now that you understand what insulin and insulin resistance
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=82s)** — really is. The first one is super common and this is excessive urination. If you have to get
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=88s)** — up through the night to urinate, suspect you have a blood sugar problem. Now I'm not talking
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=93s)** — about diabetes. It could be a pre-diabetes. The problem is when you have too much sugar
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=98s)** — in the blood it gets filtered by the kidneys into urine and wherever the sugar goes the
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=105s)** — you're basically losing fluid when you eat sugar. The kidney is dumping sugar and water
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=112s)** — because sugar is too toxic. If you're a guy you might automatically assume it's your prostate
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=119s)** — when in fact it's probably just insulin resistance. And think about how many
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=123s)** — medications that people are on just because their diet is not right. Number two, excessive
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=129s)** — thirst. Why are you excessively thirsty? Could be because you're losing water. When you
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=133s)** — retain too much sugar in your blood you retain sodium. And if you're retaining this more
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=138s)** — concentrated sodium in the body you're going to need more water to dilute it. This is why when
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=143s)** — you have high blood glucose you are going to be dehydrated. You'll probably be very
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=147s)** — potassium deficient because you're locking up a lot of potassium in the liver if you're
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=151s)** — consuming too many carbs. When you start losing too much potassium then you can't sleep,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=156s)** — your heart rate goes up, your blood pressure might go up, you might have a lot of issues
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=160s)** — Number three, skin changes. Especially in the folds of the body like the folds of your neck
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=167s)** — underneath your armpit. The skin becomes a little bit darker because you have too much
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=172s)** — glucose. The darker folds around your body just basically mean you've got blood sugar issues.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=176s)** — Number four, brain fog and fatigue. Now I had this for years and I had no idea it was my
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=186s)** — sugar. I was eating a lot of carbs, I was trying every single vitamin, it never worked. I had such
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=190s)** — brain fog, it was terrible. You are getting literally starvation of glucose or fuel inside.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=196s)** — The neurons are just starving for fuel and they just can't work anymore. If I continued
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=202s)** — on that path I probably would go right into dementia because that's what dementia is. Starvation
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=208s)** — of the neurons. Number five, mood swings. If someone's cranky, they're highly irritable,
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=214s)** — suspect they have a blood sugar that's too high that ends up going too low because of the
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=220s)** — insulin situation. A lot of mood disorders involve blood sugar issues. I mean if a
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=226s)** — psychiatrist would just get their patients on a ketogenic diet, they would probably wipe out
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=231s)** — between 80 to 90 percent of these mental problems. Number six is cravings. Not
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=238s)** — necessarily just for sugar but also for salty carbs like chips, things like that. You're not
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=245s)** — thinking in the future of what's going to happen after you eat that carb. You just want
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=249s)** — it now. You want instant relief. I was there. I would keep feeding the body what it's in the
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=253s)** — mood for, not what I should be consuming. And that's really a bad question to ask your body
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=259s)** — what it's in the mood for because it's not going to give you the right answer. Number seven
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=263s)** — is blurry eyes. The lens of the eye that helps you focus is swollen. It's filled up with fluid.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=270s)** — Over time what happens is the inside of the eyelid becomes redden and also it feels like
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=276s)** — sand is in there. I mean this sounds so obvious to me and probably you but the doctors
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=281s)** — don't focus on the diet. Doctors are taught to treat the blood sugar with medication and
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=286s)** — then carry some candy in your pocket if your blood sugar is too low. And I feel bad for
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=291s)** — these medical doctors that go into medicine because they really want to help people. But
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=295s)** — unfortunately some of the tools that they're taught are not the best tools to fix a problem
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=299s)** — only to manage a problem. I run into people all the time that are diabetics and their
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=305s)** — diabetes is being managed and they think that's a total solve problem but in fact it's not.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=311s)** — And sometimes I have to withhold my suggestion because honestly they can get rid of this in
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=315s)** — a few weeks. Maybe up to a month. A couple things about how to solve this problem. You
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=320s)** — want to run your body on a different fuel. We want to lower glucose and then the body is
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=325s)** — automatically going to start switching to a different fuel source and that's called
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=329s)** — ketones. Ketones come from your fat. This is why you're going to lose weight. The way to
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=335s)** — get your body to burn ketones is to lower your carbohydrates below 50 grams per day.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=340s)** — I would recommend lowering it like 20 grams a day. And another thing I would do now that
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=345s)** — insulin is. We want to do things opposite to insulin. We need to increase the opposite
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=351s)** — hormone. That's called glucagon. How do we do that? We do that by consuming high quality
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=359s)** — protein. Red meat or fish or even eggs. Super important and that protein will trigger the
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=366s)** — opposite hormone and help bring you back to a good blood sugar situation very quickly.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=372s)** — A1C measures your blood sugars over a period of 120 days. You're measuring how much glycated
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=381s)** — protein you have in your blood. When you combine sugar to your hemoglobin, that's protein,
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=387s)** — then it's glycated. The more percentage of your blood protein hemoglobin that is glycated,
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=394s)** — the more severe diabetes you have. There's one little thing I want to mention about this.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=399s)** — If you are starting on a ketogenic diet or even a carnivore, which you're not eating any carbs at
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=404s)** — all. You're just doing meat and things like that. You may notice that your A1C might stay
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=410s)** — higher or go back up a little bit. What you have to realize that a lot of people don't realize
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=415s)** — is that when you do the ketogenic diet, this healthy version of the keto or carnivore,
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=421s)** — you're extending the life of your red blood cells. Instead of that 120 days, it could be 130 days or
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=429s)** — 140 days or 150 days. The A1C will actually go up because the red blood cell lives longer. This
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=437s)** — is not your problem getting in a worse soft condition. This is just basically your red blood
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=442s)** — cell living longer, which throws off the formula a little bit. Now that you know about
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=446s)** — that, the next thing to know is the details of what to eat. And for that information,
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69eAWgXDGrs&t=450s)** — you should watch this video right here. Check it out.
