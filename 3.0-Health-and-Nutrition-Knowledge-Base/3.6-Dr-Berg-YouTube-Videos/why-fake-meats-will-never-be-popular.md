- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=0s)** — Alright guys, we are at the last video. So, how do we determine if something is synthetic?
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=4s)** — Just read the Bacca label and it should tell you in the ingredients if it comes from
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=9s)** — actual vegetables or an herb or some food versus some chemical name. Also, if the milligrams are
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=15s)** — all the same, like 100, 100, 100, 100, then we know it's synthetic because natural vitamins
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=20s)** — come in different amounts that are not whole numbers like 6.5, 5.3, that type of thing.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=26s)** — And so we don't want to do synthetics, okay? And do food-based vitamins, not just natural,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=33s)** — but food-based, food concentrates. Okay, to get rid of phytic acid, you want to soak the nuts
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=39s)** — in the seeds overnight, dry them out, or you can get them roasted, okay? For foods like
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=47s)** — oxalates, add lemon juice. That's what we need to do with that. Lemon juice each day,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=52s)** — lemon in the water every day, that would be very important, especially to counteract the
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=57s)** — oxalates from spinach or peanuts or some of the cruciferous vegetables. But in general,
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=62s)** — cruciferous tends to deplete iodine, so find a good sea kelp. I have one called Icelandic
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=69s)** — organic sea kelp. You can try that. It's high quality and you don't need much,
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=74s)** — probably one in the morning. Don't take it before you go to sleep because it'll keep you
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=77s)** — up at night because it gives you energy. Now for vitamin A, make sure that you get it from
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=81s)** — animal fats or fish oils or butter or cod liver oil, very important vitamin A. You can get it
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=89s)** — from eggs as well. Iron comes from animal proteins, beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, eggs.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=98s)** — Okay? B12, you can get it from spirulina, chlorella, wheatgrass juice, but you can also
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=106s)** — get it from animal protein as well. Now, if the stomach acid is low, you need something called
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=113s)** — digest formula. This gives you a combination of alpacite of vinegar and betaine hydrochloride
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=119s)** — together. You take them before a meal, take maybe two or up to four, and it helps you
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=126s)** — acidify the stomach to start pulling in those minerals. The way you know you need more
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=131s)** — stomach acid is if you get indigestion, gas, bloating, and you feel that the food's not
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=137s)** — digesting fast enough. Okay, lastly, the gallbladder. If you have gallbladder symptoms,
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=140s)** — you have right shoulder pain, you get bloating, you have a lot of deficiencies with the fat
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=145s)** — soluble vitamins. I recommend taking one gallbladder formula after the meal. The gallbladder
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=150s)** — formula I have is not just purified bile salts. It has betaine hydrochloride for the stomach,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=156s)** — it has pancreatic enzymes, it has other things to help lubricate the colon, it has other herbs
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=164s)** — to prevent gallstones. Okay guys, so you completed the mini course and now you know why
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=169s)** — someone that tries eat healthy could still have a nutritional deficiency.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1N9si1HRIo&t=173s)** — So share this course with your friends and family and I will see you in the next mini course.
