- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=0s)** — So I had some requests to do a video on this drug called Osmpick. And this is a drug that's very
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=5s)** — popular which is used for weight loss. It's an injectable drug. I'm not going to deny it does
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=10s)** — work, but it comes with a package. Some slight minor problems which I'll discuss. But first
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=16s)** — let's talk about why it actually works. What Osmpick does to the body is it increases a
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=23s)** — certain receptor called GLP1 which helps slow down digestion, thereby decreasing your appetite,
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=32s)** — cravings, so you're no longer hungry and you can eat less and lose more weight. It even improves
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=39s)** — the beta cells of the pancreas to help restore insulin levels. In fact, it's been known to
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=45s)** — improve insulin resistance. And anything that improves insulin resistance will help you lose
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=50s)** — It has some interesting effects on the liver too. It actually helps a person stop making
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=55s)** — so much sugar. That's called gluconeogenesis. And also it helps slow the breakdown of sugar
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=61s)** — in the liver. So this is why it's used with diabetics. It can help blood sugars.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=66s)** — It sounds pretty cool, right? Well, it has some slight problems. Number one, it's a bit
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=70s)** — expensive. It's between I think $1,300 to $1,500 a month. And it has some slight minor
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=77s)** — side effects like nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, headaches, gas, constipation,
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=85s)** — diarrhea, heartburn, and dizziness. Some of those don't seem minor. They seem kind of major. But
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=90s)** — let's talk about the major side effects. Thyroid cancer. There's also been another
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=95s)** — side effect of suicidal thoughts. Pancreatitis, kidney disease, retinopathy, which is
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=102s)** — damage to the retina, muscle loss, and gastroparesis, where there's a situation where
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=107s)** — food is not emptying from your stomach too well. And some of these side effects don't occur
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=112s)** — for about three days. So you have three days without any side effects and all of a sudden
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=116s)** — they kick in. And when people get off the medications, many times they still have side
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=121s)** — effects for a period of five weeks because it takes five weeks to get it out of your system.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=126s)** — And my question is, do you plan on taking this the rest of your life? What are the long
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=131s)** — term effects of this drug? Is it really going to solve your weight loss problem without giving
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=136s)** — another problem? But I'm going to recommend an alternative. Now this relates to certain
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=144s)** — herbs. Do you realize there are over 200,000 secondary metabolites? These are chemicals
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=150s)** — in plants that have therapeutic benefit to our bodies. In fact, 50% of all drugs are derived
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=160s)** — from these chemical compounds in plants. This is where Big Pharma gets their ideas. But of
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=166s)** — course, you can't patent them so you can't make a lot of money. So they're probably not going to
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=171s)** — be validated as much. But Chinese medicine, Indian medicine, all these ancient cultures have
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=178s)** — used plants for centuries. Even if we take a look at anti-diabetic effects, there's over
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=186s)** — 400 different phytonutrients in plants that have this interesting anti-diabetic effect. And
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=194s)** — they don't give you all these side effects. In fact, rarely any side effects. So if you just
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=201s)** — do a search on the internet, or maybe Google Scholar on GLP-1 agonist, you'll find all
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=209s)** — sorts of herbs that come up for this. Two very popular ones are called Panex ginseng,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=215s)** — and the second one is Berberine. In fact, Berberine is very, very potent. In fact,
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=221s)** — it kind of mimics the effects of metformin. So those are two things that I would definitely
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=225s)** — include on the list in addition to something else, which I want to recommend as well.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=231s)** — And that is the healthy version of the ketogenic diet with, at the same time, doing
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=238s)** — intermittent fasting. Because if you combine low carb and healthy ingredients with not eating so
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=246s)** — frequently, I will guarantee within three days, your appetite is going to disappear.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=252s)** — Without an appetite, without these cravings, it will make it very, very easy to do this.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=257s)** — And include it as a part of your lifestyle so you can do it long term and at a fraction of
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=261s)** — the cost. You're basically going to be eating less frequently, so it's not going to cost you
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=266s)** — any money. You're just changing what you eat. And not only will your appetite disappear and
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=272s)** — but your cognitive function will improve. You'll have a much greater mood. You'll have improved
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=278s)** — liver function. You'll have less of a fatty liver. You'll be able to preserve your muscles.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=283s)** — Your digestion will be better. I mean, just that alone is going to be huge. But let's just
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=288s)** — say you go the medical route and you do this and you lose weight, but you're tired and you
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=294s)** — have digestive bloating and you notice your muscles are shrinking and you have acid reflux.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=298s)** — What are you going to do about all those symptoms? Is this going to be just taking more
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=301s)** — medication to handle or cover up those medications? I mean, you're going to feel miserable. So this
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=307s)** — is what I would recommend. I would get some Penex ginseng and Berberine. Do the healthy
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=313s)** — version of the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting and just get started. Now, for
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjmtrhJSAqc&t=318s)** — information on how to do this in a healthy way, I put up this video right here. Check it out.
