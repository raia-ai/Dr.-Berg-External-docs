- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=32s)** — Welcome back everyone. We are here with another show Q&A. We are going to talk about Mockito.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=36s)** — We will talk about nutrition. Anything they say is not meant to replace your medical care or diagnose you because that is illegal in the state of Virginia.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=46s)** — So I just like to dive right in Stephen. Let's roll with these questions.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=50s)** — Alright, straight to social media. This time from Lisa from YouTube. I'm a 57 year old female who does 18 hours of fasting a day. There you go.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=60s)** — Please share your thoughts about using Cot liver oil as opposed to sardine or anchovy oil. Very specific.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=69s)** — Now, those oils are similar and I don't have a comparison in my mind. You'd have to do your research.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=78s)** — But I do know that if you just compare... I know Cot liver oil has the most omega 3 to omega EPA and DHA.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=91s)** — Those right there as well as the vitamin A and vitamin D. So I'm not sure if these other oils have the vitamin A and vitamin D.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=100s)** — And what's unique about that is that in order for you to make vitamin D work, you also need vitamin A.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=109s)** — And you never want to take vitamin A as a supplement because it's very hard to get a natural version that actually works. So you want to get it from food.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=117s)** — And one of the best sources is Cot liver oil. You can do liver if you like liver. Egg yolks have vitamin A, retinol.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=125s)** — But Cot liver oil gives you a really nice balance of that vitamin A, which a lot of times is missing in a lot of different formulas.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=133s)** — All right. Thank you for that. She says, Mary Moore from Rumble, will using cruciferous vegetables affect thyroid function?
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=144s)** — This this has come up many times because you have certain compounds and cruciferous that inhibit iodine.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=153s)** — And so they're called goitergenic effects. And you would have to consume.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=158s)** — I looked at this a while ago. You'd have to consume a tremendous amount of this and not take any iodine to create that effect.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=164s)** — So I wouldn't worry about it unless you're consuming a lot of it and you notice your thyroid's enlarging or you have thyroid symptoms.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=174s)** — But typically, I think a moderate or a little bit amount in your diet is going to be good because of what that cruciferous can do for your whole body.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=184s)** — So we have to look at the whole picture. It helps stimulate the phase one, phase two detoxification in your liver.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=189s)** — It lowers the risk of cancer. The sulfurophane in cruciferous can actually decrease or literally put H. pylori, which is a microbe in ulcers, back into remission. Does a lot.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=206s)** — All right. Taekwondong from YouTube. What is the primary cause of thyroid nodules, in your opinion?
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=215s)** — I think that could be a vitamin, I'm sorry, an iodine deficiency. So if you take a little C-calp and it goes away, then we know that's for real.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=228s)** — So see, what iodine does is it helps to regulate excess estrogen and too much estrogen can also cause problems with fibrocystic breast, cyst in the thyroid.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=241s)** — So one culprit to the thyroid function is estrogen. Estrogen inhibits the thyroid function and it can create problems with it.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=252s)** — So a little bit of iodine goes a long way, especially with dealing with nodules.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=256s)** — Okay, we have a lovely participant all the way from the Philippines and it's midnight there. So I'm going to be merciful and get Tina on with us.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=264s)** — And Tina, if you go ahead with your quick 30 second question, please.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=270s)** — Hello. Hi, Dr. Berg. Good morning there. Yeah, I just have some questions about the intermittent fasting that I'm doing.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=279s)** — I'm actually doing 48 hours twice a month. And then on my regular days, I'm doing 20 hours.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=286s)** — There's a variation, because I saw online that you need variation, like 20 hours, 17, 18.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=291s)** — I just want to make sure I'm doing it right, because it's been more than a month and I already lost 10 kilograms.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=303s)** — I think that's too fast. Is it normal? Or am I doing it right?
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=310s)** — Well, it's a tool to help you lose weight and also get healthy.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=314s)** — If you're losing too much weight, then you just cut it back and don't do the severity of intermittent fasting.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=321s)** — So it really depends on what's happening in your body. I can't see you. You're in your body.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=326s)** — You know, maybe if you're losing way too fast, don't do as the severity of what you're doing.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=332s)** — Maybe cut it down a little bit and adjust it. But I think the way that you know it's working is...
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=340s)** — Or in other words, the way that you know you're doing the right intermittent fasting is number one, do you feel better?
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=347s)** — If you feel like crap, then that means that maybe you're not ready for the intense intermittent fasting.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=353s)** — Number two, if you can't go from one meal to the next without considerable hunger, then you need to back it up a bit.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=361s)** — But if you're feeling great, you're improving, you're losing weight. And then with your case, you're losing too much weight,
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=367s)** — which is I know that's a big problem for a lot of people, being sarcastic. But I think you just cut it down and go at your own pace, whatever you want to do.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=377s)** — But there's so many benefits to intermittent fasting. We're actually stressing the body out a little bit to cause it to survive better.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=386s)** — And it does that with decreased risk for diabetes and Alzheimer's and cancer and all sorts of things.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=395s)** — So I think I see what you're doing. You're trying to get the benefits of it. But yeah, weight loss is another benefit that you can go too fast.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=403s)** — I mean, if I did what you're doing now, I probably would lose too much weight. I don't want to keep losing weight.
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=410s)** — So, yeah, that's my question. Thank you. Thank you so much. Sure. Thank you, Robert. You're welcome. Now you can get to bed at 12. Good night.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=421s)** — That's right. Thank you. Great call. Sounds like you're on the right track. All right. Let's see. With all due respect, I'm going to cut your audio off there, Tina.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=429s)** — And have a great evening. I just go back to social media. Christina from YouTube. If you have high cortisol levels, can you still burn ketones?
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=437s)** — Also, with getting cortisone shots, keep your cortisol levels from returning to normal.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=445s)** — Yeah, cortisol can inhibit ketosis because when you have high cortisol, it's releasing sugar from your own body and it's increasing the breakdown of your own protein and turning that into sugar.
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=461s)** — This is why people gain weight during stress. People that take synthetic cortisol as a prednisone sometimes get diabetes because of all that release of sugar increases that and then insulin.
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=476s)** — So this is a problem. Now, when you're taking prednisone, I think you said you're taking cortisol, which I did as well, it could really mess up your body because now your body becomes dependent on it.
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=488s)** — And then your cortisol levels might even be too low and can't adapt or they might be too high. Or you might create what's called cortisol resistance, which you might have high levels, but it's not working in your body.
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=501s)** — So this is why people that have high cortisol sometimes have all the symptoms of low cortisol, like inflammation and all these other things.
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=510s)** — So there is an antidote to kind of recovering from a lot of prednisone and that is taking a lot of vitamin D because vitamin D, what it does, it will bring your immune system down if it's too high and it will also bring the immune system up if it's too low.
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=535s)** — So it's an immune modulator. So it's way better than cortisol, which actually just brings your immune system down, like it suppresses white blood cells. So it's a great antidote, but you have to take it in higher amounts.
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=548s)** — All right, very good. And here is our first very interesting question, Dr. Burdick.
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=552s)** — Why is it after a global iron fortification of our foods, you know, they put the iron in the flour and the food supply and our grains and do we still have over 2 billion people who are anemic?
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=568s)** — Why is that?
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=569s)** — All right, let's see if they can figure that one out.
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=572s)** — Because because because iron is the they say iron is the most common nutrient deficiency in the world.
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=581s)** — Okay. But then they fortified the entire our food supply and now but hasn't really changed anemia. So what's up with that?
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=591s)** — All right, Gary from Rumble is asking a question I think we'd all like to know. I could not find the video on what filter used to eliminate forever chemicals and microplastics from our water.
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=600s)** — Could you please briefly review your choices for the audience?
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=605s)** — I put that link down below, but I released it.
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=610s)** — But it wasn't I didn't title it as anything related to water.
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=615s)** — It might have been a title if I'm correct. If I'm wrong, they're poisoning us.
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=620s)** — But I will what I'll do is I'll make mental note. I will put that video down below when I'm done with the show.
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=627s)** — But then I don't remember the exact name of the all three filters, but I'll put those as well.
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=635s)** — And so you can have that data. Okay. Thank you, Gary. That's terrific question.
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=641s)** — Thomas from Facebook is long term type two diabetes reversal possible?
- **[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=649s)** — Yes, it is possible. And, you know, I talk to people who are diabetic all the time and.
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=655s)** — They don't even really even know that I have a YouTube channel, but they tell me, oh, yeah, I have diabetes and it's being managed for years.
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=664s)** — I'm like, and I see what they're eating. I'm like, they don't realize.
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=667s)** — And sometimes I'll say, you know, you can get rid of that and they don't believe you.
- **[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=672s)** — So, yes, you can. You can totally get rid of it.
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=677s)** — And I'm trying to not answer a question that I think is coming on the next quiz.
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=682s)** — So I think I'll just stop right there, Steve. All right. Very good.
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=686s)** — Well, I'm going to throw a stick in the spokes. Glenda from Facebook.
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=688s)** — And we can hold this question. What's the best way to maintain healthy iron levels?
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=692s)** — Should we hold that? Yeah, we should hold that, too, because I have another question on that.
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=701s)** — All right, Glenda, you stand by. We'll go to JJ from Facebook.
- **[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=705s)** — Kombucha seems to be very popular for its health benefits.
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=709s)** — Do you recommend consuming it? You can do kombucha.
- **[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=713s)** — I would try to find something with the lowest sugars. There is a little sugar in there.
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=718s)** — So just, you know, realize that.
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=721s)** — But the acid in kombucha, lactic acid, is very, very beneficial because even though it doesn't have any microbes that are going to reseed your gut,
- **[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=732s)** — it will wake up some of the dormant good bacteria that's sitting in your gut.
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=737s)** — So it actually will improve the gut diversity.
- **[12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=741s)** — So does that just make sure that you don't shake it before you open it.
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=745s)** — It's very acidic. It's very explosive.
- **[12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=749s)** — It's a lot of carbonation in it.
- **[12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=751s)** — And then also probably consume no more than a half of a bottle per seeding with a straw, because it's very acidic to your teeth.
- **[12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=761s)** — Because one time I drank a whole bottle right before bed and I really dropped my pH down to acid.
- **[12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=768s)** — And it affected my sleep. So it's very, very acidic.
- **[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=773s)** — So you have to maybe just have small amounts.
- **[12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=776s)** — All right. Let's go to Okame from YouTube. Any suggestions on how to clear a blocked fallopian tubes?
- **[13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=787s)** — You can get those little pipe cleaner type things.
- **[13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=791s)** — I think I don't know exactly what's happening, but the formation of those tubes and the normalization of the structures around the ovary and the fallopian tubes in the uterus are highly correlated with nutrition.
- **[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=807s)** — One would be folate. The other one would be vitamin D.
- **[13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=812s)** — And I think there's some data that shows that if you take higher amounts of vitamin D, it can help to remold or model certain tissues.
- **[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=823s)** — So a lot of people have weird structures that are abnormal in the eye or in the heart.
- **[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=832s)** — And vitamin D helps to sometimes bring that down to like into a normal range. I would try that.
- **[13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=838s)** — But I think, too, when there's certain things in the environment when people are born or when they're babies that are exposed to that can affect things like that down the road.
- **[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=851s)** — But I think you could I think there's a lot of things you can do about it if you just work on it and change your diet and be real clean.
- **[14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=859s)** — All right. Very good. God's galaxy, as they call themselves from YouTube.
- **[14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=863s)** — I've been on the carnivore diet for several months and have only lost two pounds. What's going on with God's galaxy?
- **[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=874s)** — Couple things. Sometimes some people respond very well to the carnivore diet with weight loss.
- **[14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=881s)** — Sometimes they don't. There is something that happens, too.
- **[14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=885s)** — When you start consuming more protein, especially if you're female and getting close to menopause, your body starts to heal.
- **[14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=893s)** — And I'm talking about gaining a better composition with more muscle.
- **[14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=898s)** — If that's happening and you're getting more muscle and less fat, you're not going to see any change with your weight.
- **[15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=905s)** — So it's part of the healing process. It's like you're yes, you weigh the same, but you have less fat and you're more muscle.
- **[15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=912s)** — You have less atrophy that could be going on.
- **[15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=916s)** — And I don't I don't know also if you're doing the healthy version of carnivore, you know, versus going going to McDonald's and then getting all the patties and just eating on eating that that pride wouldn't be the best thing.
- **[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=928s)** — So I think if you're carnivore, you should also do a good amount of seafood and shell fish.
- **[15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=936s)** — That would be good. Very good.
- **[15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=939s)** — All right. In addition to Tina, who we heard from from the Philippines, let's see who else is tuning in.
- **[15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=945s)** — So we'd like to say a good day to all of our viewers joining us today from the UK, Canada, Mexico, Serbia, Jordan, Albania, Bolivia, Armenia, Italy, South Africa, Iran, the Philippines.

- **[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=983s)** — I don't think I had any type or any mispronunciations mispronunciations there and all across the United States of America.
- **[16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=990s)** — Thanks. Thank you, world, for joining in.
- **[16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=993s)** — And the world also appears to have answered quiz question number one, a very fascinating one, which asks, why is it after a global iron fortification of our food?
- **[16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1002s)** — Do we still have over two billion people who are anemic?
- **[16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1005s)** — And 90 percent of respondents say because iron added to foods is not bioavailable and thus not absorbed properly.
- **[16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1013s)** — And 10 percent say it lacks the proper cofactors.
- **[16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1016s)** — Those are very lofty answers.
- **[17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1021s)** — You're right. You're right. Absolutely.
- **[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1023s)** — On those two points, there's a couple additional points I want to mention, too.
- **[17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1028s)** — There is absolutely no studies to show the follow up benefits of adding iron to the food supply.
- **[17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1035s)** — OK, there's no studies. That's interesting.
- **[17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1038s)** — Secondly, you're right.
- **[17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1041s)** — The type of iron you're adding, non-heme iron, is very, very different than HEMA iron, which comes from meat.
- **[17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1055s)** — One thing about iron is that when people accumulate iron, and that's a lot of people have the body is a hard time getting rid of iron.
- **[17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1067s)** — So it has really no mechanism to get rid of it.
- **[17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1070s)** — So you got to be very cautious about adding iron.
- **[17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1074s)** — And then when you add iron, many times you create another situation called dysfunctional iron, which now we have too much iron that's locked up.
- **[18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1087s)** — Yet we also are anemic because iron cannot be used effectively.
- **[18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1091s)** — So here you are having an iron deficiency, yet you have excess.
- **[18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1094s)** — Professor Bruce Ames, who's a great scientist, he did a study and he found something mind blowing, which I don't know.
- **[18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1103s)** — Someone's talking about this.
- **[18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1105s)** — As we age, as a natural function of age, we accumulate more iron.
- **[18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1112s)** — So he compared aging tissue versus young tissue and the aging tissue had 10 times more iron than younger tissue.
- **[18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1121s)** — Now, if you understand what iron does, it's like rust and it can really create a lot of rusting out of your organs, especially the liver.
- **[18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1129s)** — It drops testosterone down to zero.
- **[18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1132s)** — It locks up your ability to make hemoglobin.
- **[18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1136s)** — So you're anemic. So creates inflammation.
- **[18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1139s)** — There's all these chemical reactions that occur with free iron, too much iron in the body that create a lot of disease, especially of your brain and your heart.
- **[19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1149s)** — So you have to be careful.
- **[19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1153s)** — Every one a day that I've seen out there, especially the top brands of one or days, and I won't mention any names, they're filled with iron and they're also filled with calcium carbonate, which is a limestone.
- **[19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1165s)** — It's like and then that locks up magnesium.
- **[19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1170s)** — So I would highly suggest not taking iron supplements.
- **[19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1174s)** — I would not cook with iron skillets.
- **[19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1177s)** — I would not take Geritol.
- **[19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1181s)** — And instead, there's a there's another trace mineral.
- **[19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1185s)** — And someone mentioned this to a cofactor to help the transportation of iron into safe places.
- **[19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1193s)** — The storage of iron.
- **[19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1195s)** — So it's not affecting our body too much.
- **[19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1198s)** — And that is copper.
- **[20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1201s)** — But sometimes just by eliminating the taking of iron or the, you know, or let's say, for example, you're older and you give blood and you feel so much better than we know you have a problem with iron.
- **[20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1213s)** — But maybe you want to take copper as a supplement, but or even just consume the foods, iron, copper, which is shellfish and get your copper a little higher.
- **[20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1222s)** — And now you have the cofactors to transport iron effectively.
- **[20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1230s)** — And because the problem is with copper is that because our food supply is very low in trace minerals and also farming methods to plead copper, it creates a lot of problems with iron in our body.
- **[20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1243s)** — All right. Very good. Enough about all that. Let's talk about iron in our second question.
- **[20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1252s)** — If you have too much iron in your body, what is the best way to eliminate?
- **[20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1255s)** — I just told you. I just told you one answer, which is copper.
- **[21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1261s)** — And I might as well just give you the rest of the answer because there's a little bit more to that.
- **[21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1264s)** — So, yeah, copper. But let's say you are over the age of 50.
- **[21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1269s)** — OK, and you're getting older and now you're aware you have too much iron inside the cell.
- **[21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1275s)** — OK, we don't we don't want that. It's like way too much.
- **[21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1278s)** — So how can we get rid of it over time or at least minimize it?
- **[21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1283s)** — Right. You already stop exposing yourself of iron.
- **[21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1286s)** — But how can we kind of it's called chelating it out, pulling it out.
- **[21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1289s)** — You when you consume certain things, you can help lock it up and then pull it out.
- **[21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1296s)** — Polyphenols, which are in like herbs and things, curcumin.
- **[21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1303s)** — Quercetin is a chemical in onions. It's a great chelator for iron.
- **[21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1308s)** — Pulls iron out. So this is one of the reasons I have onions almost every single day.
- **[21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1313s)** — I'll have like at least a half an onion or even a whole onion.
- **[21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1317s)** — Another thing you can do is the black tea or green tea.
- **[22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1320s)** — Great chelator for iron as a supplement.
- **[22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1329s)** — Lactoferrin is a very potent remedy to pull iron out.
- **[22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1334s)** — Same thing with IP6, which is another remedy that can help pull iron out.
- **[22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1342s)** — So there's quite a few things that you can chelate iron out of your body.
- **[22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1348s)** — And people are always taking these what's called polyphenols or these phytonutrients in plants and berries and thinking that they're anti-inflammatory.
- **[22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1358s)** — Probably the reason why they're anti-inflammatory is they help you get rid of iron, which is highly inflammatory.
- **[22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1365s)** — So that's just another reason to do certain things to pull out this iron.
- **[22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1371s)** — Alright, very good. Let's go to James from Facebook.
- **[22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1373s)** — Can you share your thoughts on consuming the skins of tomatoes? It's not supposed to be good for us.
- **[22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1379s)** — Should we peel the tomatoes before eating them? It sounds like an old wives tale.
- **[23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1383s)** — No, no, you want to eat those peels. That's where you get a lot of the nutrition.
- **[23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1387s)** — You have lycopene, great for prostate, good for anti-cancer, good for a lot of things.
- **[23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1396s)** — I remember my wife had a lot of tomatoes and she was going to start canning.
- **[23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1402s)** — And she said, I have to take the peels. I said, no, keep those in there. I want them.
- **[23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1406s)** — I want them in there because there's some great nutrition in the peels of a lot of plants and fruits and vegetables.
- **[23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1416s)** — Alright, hopeful news. Rebecca from Facebook. Should I breastfeed while on keto or fasting?
- **[23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1425s)** — Well, I think what I would recommend is not to do anything extreme.
- **[23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1430s)** — The key is making sure you're getting the right nutrients.
- **[23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1432s)** — So I wouldn't do any type of... I wouldn't do one meal a day. Maybe you do two meals, no snacks, or maybe three meals, no snacks.
- **[24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1440s)** — The key is to... because this is the most important time to get the most nutrition.
- **[24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1448s)** — So we don't want to necessarily do anything extreme,
- **[24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1452s)** — but we do want to do something that supplies enough of the really important nutrients of vitamin D, number one, magnesium, zinc,
- **[24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1464s)** — enough protein, because let's say there's not enough vitamin K2, because you're not eating certain things or not enough vitamin D,
- **[24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1475s)** — then the child potentially could develop subclinical problems with their bones.
- **[24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1480s)** — They can end up with bowed legs, knocked knees, scoliosis, lordosis, kyphosis, all these spinal malformations and dental malformations
- **[24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1491s)** — and they're probably going to need braces down the road.
- **[24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1494s)** — So the combination of the trace minerals, which are all the cofactors for proteins and also the fat soluble vitamins are crucial for that baby.
- **[25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1504s)** — Now, even when you breastfeed, apparently, a lot of times there's just not enough vitamin D that comes through the breast milk.
- **[25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1513s)** — So this is why they recommend even for babies giving some liquid vitamin D.
- **[25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1518s)** — But I would highly recommend, and this is like a super important thing, you should be taking between 8,000 and 10,000 of vitamin D3 every single day
- **[25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1532s)** — if you're breastfeeding to make sure that child has enough vitamin D or else they're going to be deficient and have problems.
- **[25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1541s)** — So there you have it.
- **[25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1543s)** — There you have it.
- **[25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1544s)** — All right, let's go to Laura from YouTube. If you have symptoms of a vitamin D deficiency, she doesn't mention which ones, what's the recommended daily dose of it?
- **[25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1552s)** — And can it be taken with food?
- **[25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1557s)** — It should be taken with food unless there's some oil or fat in it because it's a fat soluble nutrient.
- **[26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1562s)** — But I think at a maintenance dose, it has to be, I mean, I recommend 10,000.
- **[26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1572s)** — There's a thousand different reasons for that, but there's 10,000 different reasons.
- **[26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1576s)** — But 10,000 IUs should be a maintenance. Now, that is not a toxic dose.
- **[26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1583s)** — If you want a therapeutic dose, if you're trying to fix something, then you need to even increase it even more.
- **[26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1589s)** — But think about what 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3 really is.
- **[26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1594s)** — That's 20 minutes in the summer sun. Is that toxic? No.
- **[26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1601s)** — Well, much relief. Monowas is the name from YouTube.
- **[26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1610s)** — Excuse me, folks. Please share your thoughts on using sunscreen to stop absorption of UV rays.
- **[26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1617s)** — Don't recommend it. Don't like it unless you're extremely fair-complected and you can't get a suntan.
- **[27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1625s)** — Some people like that. And then you're going to have to substitute with vitamin D.
- **[27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1629s)** — But if you're not in that case, I highly recommend you don't use sun blockers.
- **[27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1636s)** — Because we become sunphobic. And because, oh, the sun's dangerous. All of a sudden in the 80s.
- **[27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1643s)** — Well, you would think skin cancer, especially melanoma, would drop. It hasn't. It keeps going up.
- **[27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1650s)** — So my opinion is that melanomas, which is a certain type of skin cancer, is actually a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1657s)** — But do your own research on that. But no, the sun... go out in the sun until you get slightly a little pink and then get out of the sun.
- **[27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1667s)** — Don't burn your skin. Just be out there. Build it up over time so you have a tan.
- **[27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1673s)** — But there's so many therapeutic benefits of sun for you to use sun blockers.
- **[28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1680s)** — I mean, only maybe that there's no sun protection. You can't get under. Okay, good.
- **[28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1686s)** — But don't don't overdo it because it blocks the conversion of some.
- **[28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1691s)** — Oh, some of these sun blockers don't even block the type of UV that causes damage.
- **[28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1700s)** — They only block the type of UV that turns into vitamin D because there's three different types of UV.
- **[28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1708s)** — So I did a video on that. You can look it up.
- **[28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1711s)** — Talking of counterproductive goodness. Here's quiz question number three.
- **[28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1715s)** — Why do some people have bad reactions from taking vitamin D even in non toxic doses?
- **[28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1726s)** — Audience, it's all yours. Back to social media.
- **[28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1730s)** — Let's see. Swapna from Facebook. Boy, these names.
- **[28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1734s)** — Do you have any advice for someone with fibromyalgia?
- **[28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1739s)** — I do. If it's on the right side of your body, the upper quadrant, it's not fibromyalgia.
- **[29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1748s)** — Your bile ducts are plugged and you have sludge in there and you need to take something called Tudka,
- **[29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1756s)** — which will open up the bile ducts and now all that pain in the right side will go away.
- **[29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1761s)** — All the stuff that you thought was fibromyalgia, especially up through here.
- **[29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1765s)** — And of course, you have to change the diet eventually.
- **[29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1769s)** — But there is also another type of fibromyalgia that is coming from some virus that came out of remission,
- **[29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1779s)** — like an Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus, because you went through some stress and now it's in active mode.
- **[29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1787s)** — And now you're experiencing not the full blown infection, but kind of a version of it, which is a systemic inflammation,
- **[29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1793s)** — in which case you just need to up your vitamin D, do a whole stress program where you're getting a lot of sleep,
- **[30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1801s)** — trying to do hikes through nature, exercise to reduce your stress, and that fibromyalgia should go away, if it's viral related.
- **[30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1812s)** — Okay, some really interesting questions today. Ida from Facebook, speaking of copper, she says,
- **[30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1817s)** — Does wearing copper bracelets or other items made of copper actually contribute to healing? I'll add absorption.
- **[30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1826s)** — I think it contributes to certain healing in certain ways, but it's not going to go into counter the big iron problem that people have.
- **[30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1838s)** — Okay, Tracy from Rumble, are there any remedies for chronic vertigo for a 72 year old on keto diet and using zero sugar?
- **[30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1848s)** — Would you suggest an MRI or metabolic test? Didn't say if they had it before keto, but anyway.
- **[30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1855s)** — I would, what I would do is I would watch my recent videos on vertigo and just apply it. There's a technique you can do,
- **[31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1861s)** — but you're going to have to take more vitamin D3 to remove the calcium crystals that are not being stabilized around the little hairs that help you help the gyroscope balance your body.
- **[31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1879s)** — So there's some freed up calcium deposits that are floating around there. So we got to get rid of those and vitamin D helps you absorb calcium.
- **[31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1889s)** — So that's one thing and you should watch the videos on all that information.
- **[31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1893s)** — Okay, once again, where do they go to find these videos? YouTube sometimes suppresses it. What's the deal?
- **[31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1899s)** — Just go to my website, DrBurg.com and you could search and I have every video on there so you can check it out.
- **[31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1905s)** — Now I do, I do say that all the videos I have on cancer are on rumble.
- **[31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1913s)** — And I will also say that there's been some recent videos that are taken down because there's certain things I can't talk about.
- **[32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1924s)** — And you can find those in rumble as well. But I won't even say the name because they'll shut this video down.
- **[32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1930s)** — All right, go to rumble, folks. Learn it all. XMandel from Facebook.
- **[32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1936s)** — Do you have any thoughts about the use of saffron as a way to remedy schizophrenia, a horrible disease?
- **[32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1944s)** — I have some thoughts on it, but I don't want to share them.
- **[32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1946s)** — Now, I think I think it's a valid therapy, but there's something I think a little bit better.
- **[32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1951s)** — And that would be high doses of vitamin D3. Look up the research by Hoffer on this.
- **[32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1959s)** — Amazing. I mean, he basically said that schizophrenia really is a vitamin D3 deficiency.
- **[32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1967s)** — Wow, that's very hopeful. OK, let's see. The quiz question number three asked, what do some people have?
- **[32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1975s)** — Why do some people have bad reactions from taking vitamin D, even in non toxic levels?
- **[33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1980s)** — And there's an opinion from the audience. Seventy eight percent say it's because of magnesium deficiency.
- **[33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1985s)** — Twelve percent say a vitamin K2 deficiency and the remaining 10 percent say it's a zinc deficiency.
- **[33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1994s)** — You guys are super smart. Wow, that's amazing.
- **[33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=1998s)** — Because there is quite a few. Well, I'd say maybe maybe five percent or even less.
- **[33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2004s)** — The people that react to vitamin D sometimes right away and sometimes a little longer.
- **[33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2008s)** — They're doing great. And all of a sudden they have leg cramps.
- **[33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2013s)** — They have maybe hallucinations, confusion, altered gait, high blood pressure.
- **[33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2023s)** — There's a whole bunch of different anxiety, a whole bunch of different symptoms.
- **[33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2028s)** — And they think it's a toxic vitamin D when it's not.
- **[33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2033s)** — The need for other cofactors like magnesium and other things like zinc and vitamin K2 go up the more vitamin D you take.
- **[34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2042s)** — So if you're going on a vitamin D protocol and you're already slightly deficient in magnesium,
- **[34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2047s)** — now you're going to be really deficient and you're going to have symptoms of that cofactor.
- **[34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2055s)** — This is why we recommend when you take vitamin D, take it with magnesium, zinc, K2 to prevent that.
- **[34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2063s)** — But it's really bad. It's really terrible if you don't know that and you end up going, oh, vitamin D is toxic and I'm going to stop taking it.
- **[34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2070s)** — Now you just stop taking the thing that you needed and then you're not going to understand that you're also deficient in these cofactors.
- **[34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2079s)** — So the person gets stuck with the problem.
- **[34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2082s)** — So it's so important to have the right information when you want to get help with your body.
- **[34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2089s)** — And fortunately, it's hard to get that information because of this whole scare that vitamin D is, oh, my gosh, it's toxic.
- **[34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2098s)** — It's very, very rare to get a toxic effect from vitamin D3. Very rare.
- **[35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2106s)** — OK, we've had a guest in the green room whose picture has been frozen for 20 minutes.
- **[35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2112s)** — Let me see if I can hear her. Mimi, are you there? Mimi?
- **[35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2119s)** — I'm afraid her whole thing is frozen. Let's go back to social media.
- **[35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2123s)** — KJ from Rumble, would vitamin D be good to address the symptoms of COPD?
- **[35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2132s)** — Absolutely. Because when you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, your receptors for vitamin D are severely downgraded.
- **[35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2141s)** — And one of the most potent, cool effects of vitamin D3 is what it can do for your respiratory tissue.
- **[35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2149s)** — And it can really help people with asthma, chronic breathing problems.
- **[35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2156s)** — But many times it won't work with the typical 600 IUs that they recommend.
- **[36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2163s)** — So I would I would take a lot more. I would take at least 20 or 30,000 international units of vitamin D3 every single day.
- **[36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2171s)** — Just realize this. There's some data that says that we don't need to take about every day.
- **[36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2176s)** — We can take it once a week or once every two weeks.
- **[36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2179s)** — Well, that's true if you're talking about bone or calcium vitamin D.
- **[36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2186s)** — There's a completely different system over here that that needs it.
- **[36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2192s)** — It only has a 24 hour half life. So you're going to need to take it every day to feed these other organs like your lung, your brain, your muscle, and especially your immune system.
- **[36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2204s)** — All right. Take your vitamin D for goodness sakes.
- **[36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2208s)** — Mud 4x4 country guy guess from rumble. Will castor oil dissolve cataracts? He doesn't talk how he would apply it.
- **[36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2216s)** — I don't know. I know it's it's good for the body. I'm not sure.
- **[37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2222s)** — Something to try and experiment. I think there's a there's some data that shows that it improves cataracts.
- **[37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2229s)** — Also, you know, a lot of the what's happening with the the opaqueness in the lens is you're getting it's called glycation.
- **[37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2239s)** — So you're it's like a protein that's connected to a sugar.
- **[37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2242s)** — And that's from doing too many carbs and stuff like that with with protein.
- **[37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2248s)** — So now that locks up the protein and so creates a little opaqueness that creates a lot of free radical damage.
- **[37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2257s)** — And so there's two types of antioxidants, stuff in the food and also stuff that your body makes.
- **[37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2264s)** — Your body makes antioxidants and in a more significant way than the food antioxidants.
- **[37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2273s)** — So having the right nutrients, selenium, zinc, copper, manganese with high quality protein from grass fed meats and stuff like that
- **[38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2286s)** — are really beneficial to build up your natural antioxidants to prevent a lot of these complications from glycation and iron and pollution.
- **[38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2299s)** — All right. Very good. Here's another one for and I mean this are smart audience quiz question number four.
- **[38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2306s)** — Why is fructose more damaging on the body, even if it's lower on the glycemic index than glucose?
- **[38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2313s)** — And I forgot to add that little comment in there. But all right. Very good. I can't wait to learn from the audience back to social media.
- **[38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2320s)** — Let's see. Josh from YouTube. What's the best for autophagy? A 16 hour fast every day or a 24 hour or longer fast once a week? Good question.
- **[38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2332s)** — So it's it's not like an on off switch. You kind of develop autophagy the more you fast.
- **[38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2338s)** — So there might be a little bit of autophagy starting out and then more and more and more as you go 18 hours, 20 hours, 23 hours, you get more autophagy.
- **[39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2347s)** — If you if you can do three 48 hours or 72 hours, you get a lot more top of G.
- **[39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2352s)** — So this is why I think it's periodic, prolonged intermittent fasting.
- **[39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2359s)** — So maybe once a week or once every two weeks you do 48 hours.
- **[39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2366s)** — That would go that would go a long way because it actually forces your body to get really conservative and start to recycle a lot of the tissue because it doesn't have the protein there.
- **[39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2376s)** — So it's going to recycle it. And what does it have to go after your muscles? No, it's going to go after the damaged proteins first.
- **[39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2383s)** — It's very smart. So it's going to go after, you know, scar tissue had or damaged tissue that's kind of locking up biological functions and start.
- **[39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2395s)** — It's amazing. It's a garbage disposal in your cells that will just literally.
- **[40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2400s)** — Dismantle with enzymes and then form brand new spanking new proteins to have for new tissue.
- **[40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2409s)** — It's like the ultimate for anti aging.
- **[40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2412s)** — Wow, if I may, I'm 21.3 on the fasting, but I do enjoy a cup of decaf about 10 o'clock at night with a big glop of heavy cream.
- **[40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2421s)** — Have I destroyed the whole process?
- **[40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2424s)** — Well, it's not. I think it's going to. It'll probably stop autophagy and ketosis for a little while.
- **[40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2432s)** — So maybe not do too much cream because, yes, it's low on the glycemic index.
- **[40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2440s)** — It's it's not going to stimulate insulin to a certain degree.
- **[40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2445s)** — But anything anytime you eat it all, it will increase insulin to some degree.
- **[40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2450s)** — So anytime insulin goes up, it bumps you out of ketosis in the top of the tree.
- **[40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2454s)** — So we want to keep insulin low. So maybe just do the black coffee.
- **[40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2459s)** — All right. Straight up. Here's question number four for you, Doc.
- **[41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2464s)** — OK, I already asked that. So let's do we have an answer.
- **[41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2468s)** — Let's see. Maybe that's what I meant. No, we don't yet.
- **[41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2472s)** — Let's see. Let's go to social media as we wait.
- **[41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2476s)** — A&J from Facebook can aloe aloe vera drinks harm the liver.
- **[41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2481s)** — My doctor warned me to stop drinking them and stop taking supplements except vitamin C. Your thoughts, doctor?
- **[41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2489s)** — Yeah, we should stop those natural remedies and just take the drugs because they've been tested.
- **[41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2494s)** — They're FDA approved and they're generally recognized as safe.
- **[41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2500s)** — No, I don't. I never heard that before. The aloe is is bad for you.
- **[41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2506s)** — Yeah, I think that's incorrect information, Steve.
- **[41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2510s)** — All right. Good. Well, oh, speaking of quiz question number four, which I wanted to ask twice,
- **[41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2516s)** — it asks, why is fructose damaging on the body even if it's lower than the glycemic index in the audience?
- **[42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2524s)** — Eighty five percent of respondents say it's because it directly produced in the liver.
- **[42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2528s)** — Ten percent say it's because it's very concentrated and five percent say it has similar properties to the processing of alcohol in the body.
- **[42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2537s)** — Again, some lofty answers. Is that correct?
- **[42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2541s)** — Yes. So here's the thing.
- **[42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2546s)** — You have fructose and glucose and these are individual sugar molecules.
- **[42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2554s)** — OK. And when you combine them together, they form what's called a disaccharide or two sugars like cable sugar and honey.
- **[42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2563s)** — They're disaccharides. You're both connected when you consume starches.
- **[42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2569s)** — You're just dealing with a string of glucose. There's no fructose and starch.
- **[42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2575s)** — So when you drink fructose, as in high fructose corn syrup, it's in a lot of different junk foods.
- **[43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2584s)** — Only the liver can deal with that fructose.
- **[43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2587s)** — Whereas if you did glucose, all of your whole body cells can metabolize glucose.
- **[43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2595s)** — So think about this. To force feed one organ in your entire body to deal with this poison, I'm sorry, the sugar, like that's a lot of stress on the liver.
- **[43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2607s)** — It doesn't get to be equally distributed.
- **[43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2610s)** — And so it creates more problems in the liver to the point where we have more inflammation, more toxicity, very similar to alcohol.
- **[43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2620s)** — But also it can cause insulin resistance even worse than glucose.
- **[43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2627s)** — We talk about high fructose corn syrup.
- **[43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2631s)** — So think about this. Now, your cells can't pull in insulin because they're resistant and they can't pull in glucose.
- **[44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2645s)** — So what happens now? Because we have a cell that's literally starving, yet you're consuming a lot of sugar, right? You can't pull it in there.
- **[44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2655s)** — So the body has a plan B by compensating. And what it will do, it will start to produce more glucose.
- **[44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2666s)** — It's called gluconeo. That means new. Genesis, the creation of. So now the body starts making more glucose.
- **[44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2675s)** — And I think I should just stop right there because I think there's something related to this in the next question, Steve.
- **[44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2681s)** — All right. Well, speak of the devil. Why don't we get to that? There it is, Don.
- **[44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2687s)** — Why do I always do this? I'm like, I'm giving you some clues. OK.
- **[44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2692s)** — Why do some diabetics have high blood sugar levels, even if they even even if they lower their carbohydrates?
- **[45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2702s)** — All right. Maybe you have a hint, audience. Speaking the audience, let's go to Meg from YouTube.
- **[45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2709s)** — My stomach constantly gurgles and I'm in pain. My gastroenterologist wants me to take Pepsid twice a day.
- **[45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2717s)** — Could I be suffering from low stomach acid?
- **[45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2720s)** — You could. So when you get gurgling or all these different sounds, it just tells us that your diet is not quite right for you.
- **[45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2729s)** — So I would I would radically revaluate what you're eating instead of trying to treat the symptom with some drug.
- **[45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2735s)** — It's like now we now we're going to go down a rabbit hole, which doesn't have any good outcomes because you're just camouflaging the hole in the bucket.
- **[45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2745s)** — This is the problem I have with medicine is they don't. So, Steve, let me ask you a question.
- **[45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2751s)** — Tell me one thing, one medication that helps increase the health of the body.
- **[45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2758s)** — Can you think of one? Put me on the spot here. All the medications out there.
- **[46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2764s)** — Just give me one. That's all I want. A medication, not a vitamin. Right.
- **[46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2770s)** — OK, I don't know. Right.
- **[46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2773s)** — Either do I. Because what it's doing, it's not increasing the health.
- **[46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2776s)** — It's just it's it's switching out one problem for another.
- **[46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2780s)** — Like when you take high medication for diabetes, right?
- **[46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2783s)** — What do you think it's doing to your sugar? Is it making it evaporate?
- **[46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2787s)** — No, it's just it's getting it out of the bloodstream, but it's putting it somewhere else.
- **[46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2791s)** — So basically we get we trade one problem with a side effect.
- **[46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2796s)** — And so this is the problem with medicine. It's not really based on increasing health.
- **[46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2803s)** — People will debate that. But the thing is, I don't think you're getting healthy because now you're dependent on something.
- **[46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2808s)** — And that's not true health. And also just because you get rid of a symptom doesn't mean you're healthier.
- **[46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2813s)** — So the point is that I think that if you get this gurgling sound, reevaluate the diet, change that, you probably need to increase your microbiome to help you digest.
- **[47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2826s)** — We just changed our dog food. OK, we just changed dog foods.
- **[47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2833s)** — And of course, Charlie, our dog, jumps in the bed last night.
- **[47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2837s)** — He was on the bed and I'm trying to sleep and I hear this gurgling going on all night long.
- **[47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2843s)** — It's the change in dog food. There's something in that dog food that he can't is not digesting that well.
- **[47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2849s)** — So, yeah, that's just a symptom. You're on the wrong program.
- **[47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2854s)** — Interesting. Good luck, Charlie. OK, let's see. Till we meet from Rumble after developing a staph infection following surgery, I'm now on a round of antibiotics for 14 days.
- **[47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2866s)** — Can I take a prebiotic while on these antibiotics?
- **[47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2871s)** — I wouldn't. I would take a probiotic.
- **[47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2875s)** — And then I would continue to take that probiotic after you stop because they're wiping out all the good bacteria as well as the bad.
- **[48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2883s)** — So you want to kind of replace the good bacteria. It's not going to hurt.
- **[48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2888s)** — I mean, I'd like to someone to explain to me why taking a good bacteria, why you're taking an antibiotic is bad because are we trying to kill the good bacteria for any reason?
- **[48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2899s)** — Is there any purpose for that? I don't think so. So you take that because it's what's going to happen is after you take the antibiotic, your gut never comes back to the original diversity and the ratios and stuff.
- **[48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2910s)** — So it's always a problem. And if anyone says, oh, yeah, they all grow back. Not necessarily true.
- **[48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2916s)** — Some of them don't come back. I mean, look what's happening.
- **[48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2919s)** — Look, look what happens to a person after years of taking antibiotics, including myself.
- **[48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2923s)** — You have all sorts of problems with your microbiome and digestion.
- **[48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2927s)** — And so I would watch my recent video I did on it's the micro behind depression and just you'll get some good information on that.
- **[48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2936s)** — Interesting. I'll watch it. Okay. Let's see. Dr. Berg, our astute audiences answered quiz question number five, which asked, why do some diabetics have high blood sugar levels, even if they lower their carbohydrates?
- **[49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2950s)** — And 92 percent of our respondents say it's because of insulin resistance and eight percent say it's because of a magnesium deficiency.
- **[49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2961s)** — Very good answers. Steve. So when someone's a diabetic and they start cutting down their carbs, you would expect they're not eating any sugars.
- **[49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2974s)** — The blood sugar should come right down. But a lot of times it doesn't. They'll stay higher. Like, why? It's because of something else.
- **[49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2983s)** — The liver is still so insulin resistant and like it can't it can't even absorb enough sugar.
- **[49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2991s)** — The sensors with that insulin resistance then causes the liver to make its own sugar.
- **[49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=2999s)** — And that's called gluconeogenesis. So the majority. This is interesting.
- **[50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3006s)** — The majority of blood sugar in a diabetic is coming from that gluconeogenesis.
- **[50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3014s)** — Not necessarily always the diet. That's interesting. So your body is keeping the sugar high because of the insulin resistance.
- **[50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3024s)** — So where is it getting the sugar? It's turning it's turning things into sugars, turning fats in the sugars, turning protein in the sugar, non carbohydrate sources.
- **[50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3037s)** — So this is why metformin is used because metformin has one huge effect at helping the receptor for insulin, the liver work better.
- **[50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3053s)** — So it reduces insulin resistance and it reduces that glucose production of the liver called gluconeogenesis in diabetes.
- **[51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3062s)** — And so the problem is it has a black warning label because it creates a B1 and B12 deficiency.
- **[51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3068s)** — So I highly recommend taking those vitamins. But why not take a look at maybe something that doesn't have side effects that works in a similar way like berberine.
- **[51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3079s)** — Berberine does a similar thing. There's research on it. You should look it up. But here's the big problem, Steve.
- **[51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3087s)** — If you...anytime anything natural, natural remedy creates an effect like that on a disease, then it moves over into the classification of drugs.
- **[51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3101s)** — And if someone's using that to cure it, then they're practicing medicine without a license.
- **[51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3108s)** — So the only reason I'm even talking about this is because I'm not...I don't have a patient doctor-patient relationship with people.
- **[51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3116s)** — So just giving information so you can do your research. But it's really interesting how medicine pretty much has a monopoly over disease and treatments.
- **[52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3124s)** — And you can't necessarily cross that line. But the point is, I mean, there's research, berberine.
- **[52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3132s)** — There's a lot of things also going intermittent fasting, low carb. All of these things will help reduce the insulin resistance to the point where your blood sugars will finally start coming down.
- **[52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3143s)** — That's encouraging. Dana from Facebook, do you believe manuka honey has healthy benefits?
- **[52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3150s)** — Yeah, yeah, it does. It has antimicrobial. That's a natural antibiotic effect. It's good for sore throats. It's really interesting.
- **[52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3159s)** — There's some wild properties that...for your digestion. Yeah, it's very unique. I think I've done a video on it.
- **[52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3167s)** — All right, let's go to Lini from YouTube. Could you please discuss the benefits of taking DIM?
- **[52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3174s)** — This is a super concentrated cruciferous product. So it helps to regulate excess estrogen.
- **[53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3185s)** — So it's good. Like, for example, if gyno, mastia, like excessive breast tissue in men, that would be good for that.
- **[53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3193s)** — If a woman has estrogen dominance, she should take it. So it helps to lower this estrogen, which a lot of people have too much.
- **[53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3206s)** — Interesting. Dora from Facebook, what would you recommend for those pesky varicose veins?
- **[53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3213s)** — There's several natural remedies, and you can watch my video on that.
- **[53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3216s)** — But I think probably a very important thing is that as we age, we get more problem with the veins because of a sedentary lifestyle, too much sitting.
- **[53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3228s)** — And that's the worst. Think about your...what is a vein? You hear the heart pumps, it pushes blood through the vascular arterial system, and then it hits the capillaries.
- **[53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3239s)** — And then it has to come back through the venous system. The venous system can be sluggish if you're not really exercising enough, and then it just pulls.
- **[54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3252s)** — Especially if you do too much sitting and things like that. So now we get this dilation of this vein.
- **[54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3258s)** — So I think one of the best things to do is to, beyond just the healthy diet, is to do regular, consistent exercise.
- **[54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3268s)** — Good. Okay. That sounds like sound advice. Saranda. Sarandir, excuse me, from Facebook. What's the best way to reduce high protein levels in the blood?
- **[54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3283s)** — Are you sure it's not high levels of protein in the urine?
- **[54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3288s)** — Interesting.
- **[54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3289s)** — And I mean, high protein could be a liver problem. It could be a kidney problem, especially if it's in the urine. That means there's some kidney problems.
- **[55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3304s)** — If there's not enough protein in the blood, you start getting edema, because the liver makes these proteins that are in the blood.
- **[55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3312s)** — So that's why when you get cirrhosis and you don't make enough protein, then you have low protein and you start getting edema and swelling and fluid retention and something called the CITES.
- **[55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3322s)** — So you get this pot belly effect. But too much protein, I would need more information to try to figure that out.
- **[55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3332s)** — All right. How about... Hi, Kathy from Facebook. Is there a link between a polycystic ovary and high cortisol levels?
- **[55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3342s)** — I don't think so. But I think there's a link between high levels of estrogen.
- **[55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3349s)** — And because what works really good for any type of cysts in the ovaries is iodine, which actually lowers that estrogen.
- **[55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3359s)** — Now, I remember in practice, had this lady come in, she had this serious hip pain.
- **[56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3368s)** — And I just said, you know, have you ever had your ovaries checked? Because I know that in a large ovary or cyst can refer pain to the hip.
- **[56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3376s)** — She did it and it was like massive. It was like just a huge swollen ovary.
- **[56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3381s)** — So she got in Seek Help. And I think over three weeks it went down to normal. She was fine. Hip pain went away.
- **[56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3387s)** — So, yeah, estrogen. So you want to be careful about birth control pills, hormonal placement therapy, and some of the other estrogen compounds that could potentially come from soy products.
- **[56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3404s)** — All right. Well, Terry, I'm so proud of you for typing so much. Here's a long one.
- **[56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3408s)** — This is from Nada or Nada from YouTube. My daughter is pregnant and suffering from autoimmune disorders, rheumatoid arthritis and ankle locespondylitis.
- **[56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3418s)** — Oh, he did that attacks the spine. Ankle locespondylitis. Did I say that right? Terry? Yeah.
- **[57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3425s)** — Okay. And she has constant flare ups. And I'm concerned that they may affect her six week pregnancy.
- **[57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3431s)** — And she says, thank you, Dr. Bird, to close all that.
- **[57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3435s)** — This is what I would do. I would, if you were relative, I would say, first of all, when you go through pregnancy, in theory, autoimmune disease should kind of go in remission.
- **[57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3451s)** — Apparently it's not. So the need for vitamin D goes up when you're pregnant. And so you probably were sub-clinically deficient.
- **[57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3461s)** — I would imagine your prior levels are maybe 20 or lower. And nanograms per milliliter. And I think what happens is now it's going to flare up more inflammation.
- **[57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3475s)** — So what I would do if I were you is I would start taking large amounts, probably 40,000, 50,000 I use every single day to reduce inflammation.
- **[58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3486s)** — And that extra vitamin D could actually really help that baby too.
- **[58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3497s)** — There are doctors that you can work with around the world that can help you work with higher doses of vitamin D3.
- **[58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3505s)** — And they can check different things like the parathyroid gland, making sure you're taking all the cofactors like magnesium and zinc and K2.
- **[58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3514s)** — But I think vitamin D is so important in autoimmune diseases as well.
- **[58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3522s)** — Alright, very good. Exploited is... I'm sorry to hear that. From YouTube, what are the best supplements for someone with rheumatoid arthritis? That's a horrible condition.
- **[58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3532s)** — Well, that's an autoimmune and large doses of vitamin D3.
- **[58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3537s)** — I mean, the thing is when you check your blood, you're looking at the inactive version.
- **[59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3547s)** — Very little of that goes into the immune system. Most goes into the bone and the calcium.
- **[59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3555s)** — So autoimmune is an immune problem.
- **[59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3562s)** — And the T cell misalignment between the T cells sets you up for an autoimmune disease.
- **[59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3573s)** — And they have receptors for vitamin D.
- **[59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3575s)** — And so an autoimmune disease is a hyperimmune reaction.
- **[59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3582s)** — So we're getting more inflammation.
- **[59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3584s)** — And so if we just put in an immune modulator, vitamin D, and overcome some of the resistance that a lot of people have.
- **[59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3592s)** — And this is the reason why they get autoimmune disease.
- **[59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFSflqB-Fzs&t=3594s)** — They have this deeper problem with the vitamin D receptor that just either is genetically or just a past infection.
