- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=0s)** — Cancer thrives in a low vitamin D environment. Let me explain. There are so many different mechanisms on how vitamin D can reduce someone's risk for cancer.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=11s)** — So this is really a cause 22 because on one hand the great importance of vitamin D to help keep you from getting cancer, but on the other hand if you get cancer, now what?
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=21s)** — That cancer is going to drive your vitamin D right down to the bottom. Somehow it knows that if you have enough vitamin D it's very hard for cancer to exist.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=29s)** — Number one, vitamin D has the ability to trigger a cell to commit suicide if there's damage to that cell. Because if you think about it, what's cancer?
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=39s)** — Cancer is a normal cell that converts to a cancer cell because there's some damage to it.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=44s)** — Normally what's supposed to happen if that cell is damaged is that it's supposed to commit suicide and get rid of itself.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=51s)** — Vitamin D is intimately involved doing the job so it doesn't go into cancer.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=55s)** — Number two, vitamin D helps regulate excess out of control cell growth. The tumor cell cannot get any nutrition at all or resources. It can die.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=66s)** — Next one, vitamin D is anti-inflammatory. One of the hallmarks for cancer is inflammation. Vitamin D normally is supposed to get rid of that inflammation.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=75s)** — So several of the things that occur with tumors or cancer is number one, inflammation.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=81s)** — Number two, a lack of oxygen. And number three, an alteration in the pH. In other words, the environment where tumors thrive is acid.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=91s)** — Well guess what? Vitamin D enhances almost every part of your immune system. Vitamin D also enhances chemotherapy.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=99s)** — And vitamin D also helps to make insulin more sensitive. When people have insulin resistance, they're also greater at risk for getting cancer.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=106s)** — Vitamin D actually downgrades genes that cause cancer. And vitamin D greatly supports the gut microbiome that also is like 80% of your immune system.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=114s)** — That's what vitamin D can do. Now let's talk about what cancer does. In a cancer cell, you have inflammation, that lack of oxygen called hypoxia, and you also have an environment where it's very very acidic.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=127s)** — All three of those things block the absorption of vitamin D. They don't allow vitamin D to work. Cancer also blocks the enzymes that help you convert the inactive vitamin D to the active form of vitamin D directly.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=142s)** — When you get cancer, there's a lot of damage that occurs to the liver and the kidney. The two very important sites where you have vitamin D metabolism.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=152s)** — Then there's one more important piece of the puzzle before I get into the solution. And this involves four little tiny glands around your thyroid called the parathyroid gland. Let me explain what that is.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=163s)** — So I want to show you something very interesting about tumors and cancer. 80% of tumors make this specific hormone, which is very similar to the one that we have in the parathyroid gland.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=175s)** — Let me just make this really simple. Para means next to thyroid. You have four of them. So the thyroid is right here and you got four little glands are called the parathyroid.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=184s)** — The reason why this cancer makes this hormone right here is mainly to extract calcium from the bone because the purpose of the parathyroid gland is to make sure you have enough calcium in your blood.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=198s)** — Cancer somehow is able to make this specific hormone to extract calcium from our bone. This is one of the factors that you'll see in cancer is high levels of calcium in the blood. They call it hypercalcemia.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=210s)** — And now you know why. Because that darn cancer is making this hormone, it's extracting it from our bones as well as other resources from the bones as a survival mechanism.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=220s)** — But here's the problem. This hormone, when it goes up, actually lowers and inhibits your vitamin D. Too much calcium in the blood will also inhibit vitamin D. So now we got two other additional things that suppress this vitamin D.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=234s)** — As you can see, on top of all the other barriers, having genetic problems, having vitamin D resistance from a microbe or an infection, when we get cancer, the need for vitamin D goes straight up and vertical.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=245s)** — Let's talk about a solution. There are two systems of vitamin D. Vitamin D affecting your bone and calcium. But there's another system that doesn't involve calcium. It doesn't involve your bone. It involves supporting your immune system.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=262s)** — The bone system can get by with a small amount of vitamin D once every two weeks. The other system needs higher amounts in daily amounts. For cancer, you want to go way up from 10,000. You want to do 50,000 I use every single day.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=276s)** — With the magnesium, with the K2, with the zinc. And I want to make a disclaimer. I am not telling you that this is going to cure your cancer. I am just giving you some additional information.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=284s)** — Especially since the World Health Organization even acknowledges that vitamin D has anti-carcinogenic properties. It's also interesting to other inflammatory conditions like autoimmune diseases. You have this lowered amount of vitamin D3 because vitamin D3 doesn't work when you have a lot of inflammation. You need to take more.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SIEftYSvY&t=303s)** — There's quite a few other diseases that you nearly always have low amounts of vitamin D3 in. Autoimmune diseases, osteoarthritis, which is not a...
