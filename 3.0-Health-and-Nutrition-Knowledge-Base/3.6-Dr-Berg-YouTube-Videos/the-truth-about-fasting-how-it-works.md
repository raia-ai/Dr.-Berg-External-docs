- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=0s)** — Here it goes. Another lie we've been told about certain foods.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=3s)** — And this topic is on gluten-free. Anytime something says gluten-free,
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=8s)** — it's perceived as being healthier, right? You got honey nut Cheerios, gluten-free,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=15s)** — frosted Cheerios, gluten-free. And the reason I want to do this video is I hear this all the
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=19s)** — time. I'm on the gluten-free diet. I'm eating less gluten. But there's a couple things I want
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=23s)** — to mention. Number one, what are they replacing that gluten with? Well, we have sugar,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=30s)** — cornstarch. This is a step they use in ironing to make your clothes very, very stiff. But would
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=35s)** — you ever eat cornstarch by itself? No. So in the kind breakfast, we have brown rice flour,
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=41s)** — cane syrup, 29 grams of carbohydrate per serving. There's a lot of carbohydrates in here. And if
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=46s)** — you look at the fine print for this one, it contains bio-engineered food ingredients. That
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=53s)** — is a nice way of saying it's GMO. So gluten is the only protein that humans cannot digest.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=60s)** — And over the years, we've added more and more gluten to the diet. It's created a lot of
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=64s)** — problems with gut inflammation. My main point is that gluten-free is not any healthier at all.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=69s)** — They're still loaded with seed oils, sugar, and starches. And sometimes it's not even
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=75s)** — cornstarch. It'll say foodstarch because then they can use other types of starches. We know
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=83s)** — starches and sugars actually also destroy the gut. The good bacteria prefer fiber,
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=88s)** — but the bad bacteria will thrive on refined sugars and starches. So when you're dumping
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=94s)** — all this extra carbohydrate into the digestive system, you are creating an overgrowth of bad
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=101s)** — bacteria. And when this bad bacteria breaks down and dies, a lot of times it releases a
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=107s)** — byproduct. And this byproduct is very, very toxic. And this creates a whole chain reaction
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=112s)** — of inflammation of the liver, of fatty liver. In fact, so many people have skin issues,
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=118s)** — inflammation of the skin. It's called dermatitis. And so they use creams and lotions and potions
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=123s)** — and all these other things, but they're not looking deep into the gut because there's a big
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=128s)** — disconnect between what's going on in the gut and your skin. And if you have too much
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=132s)** — bad bacteria in your gut, your skin's going to be terrible. It's going to have a lot of
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=136s)** — issues. That's problem number one. The second thing I want to talk about is how do they remove
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=140s)** — this gluten protein from the grain? Do they just add water to it and kind of let it just
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=147s)** — dissolve? No, they add several chemicals, enzymes, acids to extract the protein
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=154s)** — from the grain. And what are we left with? A more highly refined product. So if it was
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=160s)** — refined before, now it's really refined. You also have to realize what starch is.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=164s)** — Starch is basically sugar. It's a chain of sugar molecules connected together. It will create more
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=171s)** — of a blood sugar effect than actual sugar. So in your mind, if you think that starches are
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=176s)** — healthier than sugars, no, starch is worse than sugar on the glycemic index because they spike
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=183s)** — your blood sugars. So they have gluten-free cookies, gluten-free bread, gluten-free
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=187s)** — crackers and granola bars. So just don't buy the concept that they're any healthier at all.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=191s)** — The other interesting thing about gluten-free products is it's just low in protein. Protein is
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=197s)** — the thing that satisfies us. The problem is there's such low protein in this. We'll just
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=202s)** — keep eating it and eating it because there's nothing to satisfy us. This creates overeating.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=206s)** — This creates cravings. Two of the common ingredients that they use in gluten-free
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=211s)** — products would be rice flour and tapioca flour because both of those don't have gluten in it.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=217s)** — Let's just talk about rice flour. Rice has a unique ability to bind with arsenic in the soil.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=223s)** — It's a poison. So on top of all the carbohydrates and sugars, we have extra added
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=228s)** — arsenic. Gluten-free was supposed to initially help us with digestive problems. It's going
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=233s)** — to give us something called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. These pathogens that are
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=238s)** — growing in the small intestine compete with the good bacteria. They basically grab and eat
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=245s)** — up your vitamins and minerals. In their minds, a lot of times they think that fiber is going to
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=250s)** — help them. The more fiber they consume, the worse that they get because they're going to get
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=256s)** — fermentation that normally should be in the large intestine happening in the small intestine.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=261s)** — All that inflammation over a period of time, if they continue to do it, is going to create
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=265s)** — a lot of inflammation, leaky gut. Whatever's going on in the gut is going to be happening
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=269s)** — up here too. Mentally, you're going to be moody. You're going to have a lower emotion.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=274s)** — You might have anxiety. You might have depression. And all of that is coming from the gut. Now,
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=280s)** — I've talked to a lot of patients who had SIBO in the past. And it's interesting because when
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=285s)** — they get an antibiotic for maybe some other reason, they feel wonderful. It's the thing that
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=292s)** — really solves their bloating. And so they might think that's a good thing. So they want
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=296s)** — to get another antibiotic. But the reason why it's working, it's killing off bacteria,
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=300s)** — but it's killing off the good and the bad. Certain types of other bacteria start to grow
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=306s)** — in large amounts, especially yeast and especially candida. And this is why one of the side effects
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=311s)** — from antibiotics is a candida infection, a yeast infection. Now we have nothing in there
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=318s)** — to keep those bad guys in check. They get out of control. So a person normally will feel
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=322s)** — better after the antibiotic, but then over time they get worse. And so they go on another
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=326s)** — antibiotic, they feel better, and it gets worse to the point where these antibiotics
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=330s)** — don't work anymore. These microbes have developed this resistance. And now the next
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=336s)** — round of antibiotics don't work anymore because they have such an altered microbiome. They
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=342s)** — no longer have the diversity of microbes. Now they have a hard time digesting anything. They
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=347s)** — have certain allergies. It might develop an autoimmune disease. One way to develop an overgrowth
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=353s)** — of unfriendly bacteria is to consume a lot of gluten-free ingredients. Another way is
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=358s)** — to take antibiotics. The solution is if you see something that's gluten-free, read the actual
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=364s)** — ingredients. And yes, you may need to avoid gluten, but don't get another product that has
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=369s)** — even worse ingredients. I'd highly recommend taking all grains in general and all seed oils
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=376s)** — and all sugars and put them way over here. Put them to the side. Start eating whole foods
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=381s)** — like meats and vegetables. But if the fiber from the vegetables make things worse, where you feel
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=387s)** — bloated, you may need to do a carnivore diet for a few months to get things back in check.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=392s)** — But here's the thing. When someone does a carnivore diet, they're eliminating a lot of
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=396s)** — things that can create problems with the small intestine. So they're going to feel a lot
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=401s)** — better. The question we still have is, can you do this long term? We don't know. Should
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=406s)** — we go back to some fiber? And at what point? We don't know. But what we do know is there's
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=411s)** — probably missing microbes that created the problem in the first place. The inability
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=415s)** — to digest fiber, for example, because that's what microbes do. They help break down fiber.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=420s)** — We don't have the ability to break down fiber. If you have any problems with digesting fiber,
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=425s)** — we know there's missing microbes probably from an antibiotic or it could be from just eating
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=430s)** — this crap right here. In which case you have to put these microbes back into the gut. One
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=436s)** — way to do it is to start consuming more fermented foods. Now this could be fermented dairy,
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=443s)** — unless you're allergic to dairy, like raw cheese or kefir or yogurt, but also fermented
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=450s)** — vegetables like sauerkraut, kimchi, pickled vegetables, pickles. All of those are excellent
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=457s)** — because we're on a very important topic, digestion. I want to give you a complete knowledge
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=463s)** — of how the digestive system works. And for that information, I want you to watch this
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350bk9Ph3ak&t=468s)** — video right here. Check it out.
