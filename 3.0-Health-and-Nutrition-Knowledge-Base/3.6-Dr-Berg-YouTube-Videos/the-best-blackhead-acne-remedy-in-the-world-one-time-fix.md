- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=0s)** — When you have blackheads, whiteheads, acne, pulling them out with an instrument or tweezers
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=4s)** — or using manual pressure to pinch your skin comes with a package.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=7s)** — I don't recommend you doing this. This could actually be dangerous to your skin.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=11s)** — I did this the wrong way. I put a lot of scarring on my face.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=14s)** — What are those little structures that bring the oil to the surface of your skin?
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=18s)** — The root cause of a blackhead, a whitehead, acne are all coming from the same thing.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=23s)** — The solution I'm going to talk about is way better than the topical creams that people are using for these issues.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=28s)** — It's just treating the symptom. We're not fixing the cause.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=31s)** — When we're dealing with any skin problems, it's so important to identify the real problem before we even get to a solution.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=38s)** — If you look up blackheads, whiteheads, it'll list things like bacterial infection.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=42s)** — You have too many dead skin cells. The difference between a whitehead and a blackhead,
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=46s)** — when you have a blackhead, the oil inside the pore is more exposed to oxygen and it's oxidizing like an apple would turn brown
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=53s)** — versus a whitehead, which is something that's not exposed to oxygen.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=56s)** — When we're talking about pus, we're mainly talking about oil.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=60s)** — One big confusion of the actual problem is thinking that the person is just producing too much oil.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=67s)** — And that's what's causing this whole problem.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=69s)** — Some of these topical creams do work, at least temporarily.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=72s)** — I'm also talking about another cream called Enado Extract, which is loaded with a very special type of vitamin E,
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=79s)** — which does help control the oil to some degree.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=81s)** — One of the big things that I'm going to share with you is that a lot of people actually are solving the wrong problem.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=87s)** — That is actually not true. It's not the excess oil production.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=91s)** — The real problem is this. That little gland is producing thicker, stickier oil that doesn't flow like normal oil.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=100s)** — What's behind that? What causes this sticky oil?
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=105s)** — There are five causes. The fifth cause is the most common.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=107s)** — I just want to run through all of them so you know what they all are, because they all relate to what we're going to do about it.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=113s)** — The first thing is hormones. We know in puberty, your androgens, including testosterone, are going to be a little bit too high.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=120s)** — That produces a high level of a certain type of testosterone called DHT.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=126s)** — DHT makes your oil into like a glue, sticky, thick substance.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=132s)** — Number two, the other hormone involved in this is insulin.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=135s)** — Having too much insulin will then raise your androgen levels.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=139s)** — You know that insulin that's triggered by carbohydrates, sugars, starches.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=143s)** — Too much insulin will also block number three, which is a zinc deficiency.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=149s)** — When you're eating a lot of refined carbs and sugar, you're depleting your zinc.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=153s)** — Zinc is crucial in regulating the amount of oil that that gland produces.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=158s)** — And if you're deficient in zinc, not only will you produce too much oil, that oil will be thicker.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=164s)** — It'll be stickier. Zinc is also needed to prevent the excess amount of that powerful testosterone called DHT.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=172s)** — Can you see how this relates? It's important to know all these pieces to this puzzle.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=177s)** — Because let's go to number four. And this is in vitamin A deficiency.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=181s)** — When you're deficient in vitamin A, you get very sticky, thick oil.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=186s)** — And it plugs everything up. And by the way, you need zinc to allow vitamin A to work.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=191s)** — They both work together.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=192s)** — This last thing, number five, is the most important thing you need to know.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=197s)** — And this is based on the fact that the oil in your skin is mostly an unsaturated fat.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=203s)** — Hmm, why is that so significant? Because other unsaturated fats that you consume make up that oil.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=210s)** — Seed oils are highly processed. When you consume them, they start making up the oil in your skin.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=217s)** — Now we don't have something natural. We have something very highly pro-inflammatory.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=222s)** — All that seed oil will build up in your liver and prevent you from making enough bile
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=227s)** — to be able to even absorb fat soluble vitamins like vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=234s)** — You need a healthy liver to get enough vitamin A for your body to actually have good skin.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=239s)** — We're dealing with an industrial oil that should never be in our diet.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=244s)** — Unfortunately, these seed oils will stay in your body for literally a year and a half to up to two years.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=251s)** — So you're going to have to avoid seed oils for a good amount of time.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=255s)** — What type of foods are creating this problem? Well, ultra-processed foods are creating this problem.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=261s)** — Because what's in an ultra-processed food? Refined sugars and we have refined starches.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=265s)** — And I don't know if you know this, but the more refined sugar you eat, the more refined starch you eat,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=270s)** — the more you deplete yourself of zinc. And all these processed ingredients destroy the liver,
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=275s)** — which actually prevents you from even using vitamin A in the first place.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=279s)** — And on top of all that, the sugar, the starch will really jack up.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=283s)** — Your insulin levels as well as the seed oils will also create insulin resistance,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=289s)** — which will then cause your body to make more insulin. Your skin is getting hit from every angle.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=295s)** — Let's look at the opposite of that. What should we be eating to keep our antigens low,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=299s)** — our insulin low, to have enough zinc, to have enough vitamin A, low carbohydrate?
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=304s)** — Okay, we don't want any sugar or starch. Your skin is going to start to heal.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=306s)** — In addition to reducing the seed oils, there's other foods that are high in omega-6 fatty acids as well.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=312s)** — And that would also be animals that are fed grains, like chicken.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=316s)** — The eggs from chicken could potentially make things worse, and even pigs that are fed grain.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=320s)** — And this is why I'm going to recommend consuming grass-fed beef, lamb, wild-caught fish, sardines, shellfish,
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=329s)** — which is high in zinc. And by the way, red meat is loaded with zinc.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=333s)** — But you can get your vitamin A from grass-fed butter, as well as from grass-fed beef liver.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=338s)** — And cod liver oil is loaded with vitamin A.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=340s)** — This simple switch from avoiding these junk foods and eating these healthy foods
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=345s)** — will get at the root of your skin problems in the fastest way possible
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=350s)** — without having to cope and treat the symptom anymore.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhWpH0SNfM&t=354s)** — Thanks for watching, and I will see you in the next video.
