But there's something else that's amazing. I stumbled on this by accident. I was taking this vitamin. I never took it before. Go to sleep. Wake up. And I just noticed like all this stiffness that would normally have because of all the injuries to my spine. It's like someone to put WD-40 in my joints. I'm like, why?
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=29s)** — Am I feeling so loose? So I'm like, oh, I took that vitamin the day before. So with arthritis, you have inflammation, breakdown of the cartilage. You have wear and tear. You have pain. People are taking NSAIDs to get rid of inflammation. The problem is there's some side effects. GI bleeding, ulcers, kidney problems, things like that. If you take a steroid, the side effect is it'll destroy your joints. It'll lower your immune system. So is there something that you could take that doesn't have these adverse effects?
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=59s)** — And the answer is yes, specifically in the mitochondria. And it's a precursor to this molecule called NAD. NAD is kind of a helper molecule for turning food into energy like ATP. And so we're talking about biochemistry here. We're talking about helping move these things called electrons, which are really unusable until you package them into a certain
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=89s)** — energy form. So that's what NAD helps you with. And NAD is involved in over 400 different genes. So it's a really important molecule. And I'm going to talk about first what happens when you're deficient in NAD. All right, number one, you're going to have low collagen repair. Number two, you're going to have inflammation. Number three, you're going to have fatigue because you're not going to be able to make energy. Number four, you're going to have muscle pain, muscle
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=119s)** — weakness, and even loss of muscle. Number five, you'll have metabolic diseases, right? And that could range anywhere from diabetes, Alzheimer's, even cancer. Next one is aging faster than you should. Because if you can't repair the DNA, you're going to age faster. And then the next one is lowered immune system. But aspirin targets something in your cells that helps make proteins in certain types
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=149s)** — of fats. Well, it just so happens that this vitamin that I'm about to reveal does a similar thing to aspirin, but without the side effects, it helps to reduce the oxidative stress in the endoplasmic reticulum. So that's very interesting. So that's probably why my neck is so loose right now, which I'm very excited about. All right, so what is this vitamin called? Vitamin B3, niacetamide. There's two versions of B3. You have niacin and you have niacetamide. Niacin is really
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=179s)** — good for lipids and cholesterol and all that stuff. Niacetamide works more on inflammation, arthritis, and many other things as well. And so niacetamide. So here's how you'd want to take it. You'd want to take smaller amounts of it through the day, than higher amounts once a day. So maybe you take 100 to 150 milligrams, three to six times a day, depending on how severe your arthritis
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=209s)** — is. So in other words, taking a little bit more niacetamide through the day helps to allow your biochemistry to work a lot better, despite having these genetic issues. They're called polymorphisms. Okay, a couple other things about this. You'd want to make sure you have sufficient protein for it to work because you need protein, right? It's like the building block to help you repair the joint. Also make sure you're not drinking any alcohol. I don't know if you know this, but tryptophan
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=239s)** — can convert to B3 as well, but the efficiency of that is not very efficient. It takes like 60 times the units of tryptophan to turn into one unit of B3. A lot of times people are not getting that conversion, despite all the problems in the diet, especially if you consume a lot of corn that can block your tryptophan. And also if you're eating junk foods and things like that, you can definitely easily be deficient in vitamin B3. But I just wanted to give you a little bit of a
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=269s)** — overview, maybe the mechanism of how this niacinamide works. And I'm liking it a lot. And I think out of all the things that I've taken, and I'm not telling you not to take other things like vitamin D, but this niacinamide is just fascinating. I'm not recommending taking it right before bed at first. You want to kind of gradually work into it maybe earlier in the day. But there's some people that say that just helps them sleep. Niacinamide also helps to give you energy to exercise, which is really cool. But I wanted to just kind of focus in on this natural remedy for
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDRf0Lf5sE0&t=299s)** — arthritis that, boy, if you have arthritis, it sure is nice to have something that is non toxic, that's effective, and that is very low cost. Now, if you wanted to know the number one anti inflammatory food you should be eating, you should probably check out this video right here.
