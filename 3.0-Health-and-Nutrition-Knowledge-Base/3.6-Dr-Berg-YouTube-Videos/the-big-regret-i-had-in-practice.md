- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=0s)** — So there's one really big regret that I have in practice. That I wish I had the information that I had now back then.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=9s)** — Because the advice I gave on this one topic was very bad advice. I used to recommend 1200mg of calcium to people, especially postmenopausal women, for bone health.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=21s)** — Especially if they had any type of osteopenia or osteoporosis.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=27s)** — Check this out. If you have someone with osteoporosis, obviously they're missing calcium in the bone. That's true.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=35s)** — Almost every osteoporotic person without exception also at the same time has excess calcium outside their bone.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=47s)** — In 15 independent clinical trials, they found an increased risk, 30% for heart attacks, a 20% increase in strokes just by taking an extra 500mg of calcium per day.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=62s)** — In another study involving 61,000 people over 19 years, there was a pretty strong correlation between people taking over 1400mg of calcium per day and a 114% increase in dying from heart attacks.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=81s)** — You just go to the store and look at the vitamin bottles, right? Look at the one a day. What's the first ingredient? Calcium carbonate.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=88s)** — Notice how heavy that bottle is. Because most of that product is calcium carbonate. You're basically eating rocks.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=95s)** — I mean, when you think about it, how is that affecting the heart? How is it affecting the tissues with all this calcium?
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=100s)** — One third of all adults in America over the age of 45 have some type of calcification in their arteries.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=107s)** — So this idea that if we just take calcium, it'll go right to the bones is not true.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=113s)** — Yes, we have the calcium in the bone, but also calcium has other functions, especially all the different communication between the cells.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=121s)** — You use calcium. You have the intracellular calcium and you have the extracellular calcium outside.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=127s)** — In fact, you have a lot more extracellular calcium. You have a thousand to ten thousand times more extracellular calcium right here than inside your cell.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=137s)** — And so when this cell builds up too much intracellular calcium, it commits suicide.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=143s)** — And check out this next point. Calcium accumulation is an independent factor of risk of all cause mortality.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=152s)** — And check this out. People that are taking calcium channel blockers. Normally you probably know they're taking it for high blood pressure.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=158s)** — But did you know that it creates other effects? It can also help improve chronic diseases, including ALS,
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=168s)** — Parkinson's, Alzheimer's. It can decrease the risk from coronary artery spasm and Jina.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=174s)** — There's one study that shows that taking calcium channel blockers decreases the risk of all cause mortality.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=183s)** — What does this tell you about calcium in our bodies? But the point is that this drug has multiple effects that go beyond just blood pressure, which is very interesting.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=192s)** — So since we're on the topic of osteoporosis or bone loss, and what should you do instead of taking massive amounts of just calcium to try to fix that?
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=202s)** — If you ever look up the condition called scurvy, which is an advanced vitamin C deficiency, and you read all of the side effects of scurvy, you're going to see one of them called bone resorption.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=218s)** — So in other words, a severe vitamin C deficiency causes calcium to leach out from your bone.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=226s)** — Another symptom of scurvy is decreased synthesis of collagen. Synthesis means the production of something.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=235s)** — I mean, think about what bone really is. A lot of it's collagen protein. And so if you don't have enough vitamin C, you can't make that collagen.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=243s)** — Another symptom of scurvy is something called osteolysis. What does that mean? That means the destruction of bone.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=253s)** — Another symptom is osteonecrosis. That's a similar thing that means death of your bone.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=259s)** — As I continued down the list of scurvy, I also found osteopenia as well as osteoporosis.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=267s)** — I also found another side effect of oxidative stress, aka a lot of inflammation.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=274s)** — And the last side effect that I found, which was very revealing, is calcification outside the bone.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=284s)** — And so what would be the remedy for osteopenia or osteoporosis? Well, one big thing that I would recommend is therapeutic doses of vitamin C.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=293s)** — And as I did a deep dive into this topic, you're not going to be able to fix your osteoporosis or osteopenia just by normal amounts of vitamin C.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=303s)** — You're not going to even create a dent into that problem. You may need to use another type of vitamin C.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=310s)** — So you can use ascorbic acid or another one that might be good is magnesium ascorbate. Why?
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=316s)** — Because the magnesium is really good to help lower the pathogenic calcification problem that we're trying to deal with here.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=325s)** — And the amounts that I would recommend of this vitamin C would be minimally 6,000 milligrams per day.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=331s)** — Now, there's a lot of research on this, not just for osteoporosis, for other things, but 6,000 plus.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=340s)** — So some people need to go a lot higher. Okay. Now, I would recommend breaking it up into two or four doses.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=347s)** — And one way to determine if you're taking too much is if you have diarrhea. Okay, because that's one of the side effects.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=353s)** — So you want to take a certain amount until maybe your stools are loose and then back off a little bit.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=358s)** — Having enough vitamin C can suppress the cells that break down your bone. And those cells are called osteoclasts.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=366s)** — And having enough vitamin C can help the absorption of calcium in your bone.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=372s)** — And this is that regret when I used to recommend these calcium supplements. I don't recommend that. Okay.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=378s)** — Now, you can get enough calcium just from a little bit of cheese.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=382s)** — But the point is, if you have excess soft tissue calcium, you don't want to be guzzling gallons of milk all day long.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=390s)** — Definitely not the calcium supplements. Ant acids. Now, I'm not telling you not to take your antacids,
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=395s)** — but antacids a lot of times involve taking calcium. And then you're going to neutralize the stomach acid, which helps you absorb calcium.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=403s)** — Check with your doctor to see if you really need to take that antacid.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=406s)** — It may be contributing to your extracellular extra calcium problem that you have.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=413s)** — And don't forget about the magnesium. Magnesium is a natural calcium channel blocker. Also vitamin K2.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=419s)** — A K2 deficiency is the most reliable predictor of vascular calcification.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=427s)** — And of course, if you're dealing with osteopenia or osteoporosis, a good trace mineral complex would be good.
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=433s)** — So you get all the different trace minerals as well as consuming high quality protein in your diet like red meat.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=441s)** — Very, very healthy. Eggs are good. But red meat is going to be the best protein to build bone.
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2no13WwLAmo&t=448s)** — Now if you haven't seen my video related to calcium, milk, and phosphorus, I put that up right here. Check it out.
