- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=0s)** — So there are a lot of different symptoms that can occur with a potassium deficiency.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=4s)** — Today we're going to talk about the most serious symptom that you need to know about. What's unique
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=9s)** — about potassium compared to other minerals is that potassium is needed in very large amounts.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=17s)** — We need 4,700 milligrams every single day. But if we compound that with high amounts of sodium
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=24s)** — from salt, we can create a really bad situation because sodium and potassium work as kind of a
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=31s)** — teeter-totter. And a lot of people are eating a lot of junk food high in salt, but they're not
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=36s)** — eating enough potassium foods. And so this ratio is way off. It's backwards. Normally you should
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=42s)** — have at least a two to one ratio. Two times as much potassium as sodium. So even if you are low
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=49s)** — and you have the right ratios with sodium, it's more protective to your heart. 98 to 99% of all
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=58s)** — the potassium is located inside your cell, not in the blood. And this also relates to magnesium.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=65s)** — Most of our magnesium is inside our cells, not in the blood. So you could check the blood
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=69s)** — all you want. It just doesn't give you a lot of good information about nutrient deficiencies.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=73s)** — Now why do we need so much potassium? Well, there's a pump that is in every cell in the
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=80s)** — body. And this pump is called a sodium potassium pump. And what it does is it helps to generate
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=89s)** — electrical current around the cell to power the nervous system and the muscular system.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=96s)** — Kind of like if you go to a dam and you see the water being let out. And so this is why
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=101s)** — it's so important to have the right amounts and concentrations and ratios of potassium and
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=108s)** — sodium to be able to generate this charge. And so many of the things we're going to talk
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=112s)** — about today are related to a lack of that electrical charge to power both the nervous system
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=119s)** — and the muscular system. So we have nerves, muscles, and the control over your blood vessels
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=127s)** — as well. I'm talking about vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Basically the vascular tone
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=133s)** — of your arteries are highly influenced by potassium. And this is one of the main causes
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=138s)** — of high blood pressure is low potassium. But you're probably not going to see that promoted
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=143s)** — because of the money involved in high blood pressure medications. But what you will see
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=147s)** — is that 90% of all hypertension is what's called essential. It means they don't know what causes
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=157s)** — it. Well, but you anything that it's part of that is a potassium deficiency. All right,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=161s)** — let me first go through the symptoms that are maybe not as serious, but they can be.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=166s)** — And then we'll get to the number one most serious symptom. All right, so we have fatigue.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=171s)** — You're going to have problems with your muscles, constipation, tremors, which is a muscle nerve
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=178s)** — problem. The other common problem with a potassium deficiency is abnormal heart rhythm problems.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=186s)** — Now, how many people have a problem with their rhythm of the heart? A lot of people. How do
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=191s)** — we know that? Because a lot of people are on medication for that. You can have various
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=195s)** — mental issues when you have a potassium deficiency from being delirious, hallucinations,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=204s)** — psychosis, and depression. Potassium is also needed to store glucose as glycogen in your
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=212s)** — liver and in your muscles. When you store glucose as glycogen in your liver and your
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=217s)** — muscles, you have also a lot of water that comes with it. So for every one glucose
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=223s)** — molecule that's stored, about three molecules of water are stored. When someone does a
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=229s)** — ketogenic diet or they go on a certain fast, what's going to happen? They're going to use
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=234s)** — up that glycogen and they're going to release a lot of that water. And with the loss of
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=240s)** — that water comes the electrolyte potassium. And this is one of the reasons why I recommend
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=244s)** — taking a good electrolyte powder with potassium when you do the ketogenic diet.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=249s)** — Now without enough potassium, the blood pressure goes up. We've talked about that,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=256s)** — but I didn't tell you this interesting fact about this. Potassium actually keeps the arteries
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=262s)** — soft, elastic, and it also increases something called nitric oxide. Whereas sodium tends to
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=269s)** — stiffen the arteries and lowers this nitric oxide. So potassium is really important for the
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=275s)** — of your arteries and especially if you have anything connected with high blood pressure.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=280s)** — If you're potassium deficient, you can get headaches, you can get low back pain,
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=285s)** — bright back of your kidneys, you can become dizzy, and also you can have nocturia. What's
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=291s)** — that? That is a situation where you have to get up at night and urinate. With a potassium
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=296s)** — deficiency, you'll have a tendency to hold more fluid. You have more edema in your lower
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=301s)** — extremity or it could be anywhere actually. With a potassium deficiency, your pulse rate will
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=306s)** — tend to go a little higher as well and your risk for stroke goes up. But now let's talk about
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=312s)** — the number one most serious side effect from a potassium deficiency and that is sudden cardiac
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=320s)** — death. Heart failure. If someone has low potassium, their risk for sudden cardiac death
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=326s)** — increases by 10x. And even if we take a look at people with heart problems,
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=332s)** — what are they usually on? There are medications that manipulate sodium and some of the diuretics
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=337s)** — out there also get rid of potassium at the same time. But I'm telling you, there's just not a
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=342s)** — lot of focus on this potassium, this other side of the coin that I think is completely neglected
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=347s)** — in the area of cardiovascular health. Now that you know the number one serious symptom, let's
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=353s)** — talk about what foods or what things can create a deficiency. Well, number one, your diet. You
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=359s)** — just don't consume enough of leafy greens, squash, nuts, shellfish, bone broth, avocados,
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=368s)** — pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, mushrooms, all have potassium but also an excess of certain
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=377s)** — I'm talking about refined sugar and refined starches and refined grains, aka junk foods,
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=387s)** — will all deplete you of potassium. Then you get stress, steroids, gut inflammation or mal
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=394s)** — absorption, and then we get alcohol. Alcohol will also deplete potassium. So as you can see,
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=400s)** — potassium is super important for your health but also this other mineral is equally important
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=407s)** — for your health and that is called magnesium. And if you haven't seen my video magnesium,
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7xtsTM4ysw&t=411s)** — check it out. I put it right here.
