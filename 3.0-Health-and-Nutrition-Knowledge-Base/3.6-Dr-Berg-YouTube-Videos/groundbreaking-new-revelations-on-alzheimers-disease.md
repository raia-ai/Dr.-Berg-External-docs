- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=0s)** — There are a lot of videos on Alzheimer's. I've talked about amyloid plucking.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=5s)** — I've talked about some falsified research relating to amyloid plucking. I've talked about
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=11s)** — the genetic factor of getting Alzheimer's or putting you at risk by 30 to 50 percent.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=18s)** — If you have a very specific, it's called an APOE4, if you have that mutation,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=25s)** — 30 to 50 percent more at risk. I've done all these videos as I find more information,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=30s)** — but I stumbled on something that is groundbreaking. It's actually quite amazing. You have to hear
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=35s)** — about it. The more you understand the true mechanism of a problem, the more a solution
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=41s)** — will pop out. If you were to take a match and you were in the woods and you would light the
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=45s)** — match and start the woods on fire, would it help to focus all your energy on putting out
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=50s)** — match? The answer is no. As a child, I loved to play with matches. Unfortunately, it got me
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=56s)** — into trouble. I remember one time when I was really small, probably... actually, this was
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=62s)** — last year. No, I was eight years old and a friend and I were playing with matches. I found
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=69s)** — some matches and we went in the back of the field. I wanted to see what would happen
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=75s)** — if I lit a match into this empty bird nest that was just sitting there. There's no birds in it.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=80s)** — I just want to see what would happen. So I light it and fire and my friend says,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=86s)** — put it out. I said, no, let it go a little bit longer. Well, within a matter of seconds,
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=90s)** — it just starts spreading like crazy. We bolted to the back of the neighborhood,
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=96s)** — to someone's house to get water. And then we turn around and the entire field is on fire.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=101s)** — Okay. And so I had to run home and tell my father that I lit the field on fire. And as
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=109s)** — he looked across, you can see the neighborhood with these flames behind the entire neighborhood
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=113s)** — that's spreading to the next neighborhood. And you can imagine how much trouble I got into
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=118s)** — and how I felt. But just my luck, it started raining. I just seemed to luck out. It started
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=126s)** — raining and it put the fire out. But that was a scare. I don't know why I told you the
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=130s)** — story, but it does relate to the match forest concept. Well, that's what research has been
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=136s)** — doing the last 20 years, focusing on the match. Okay. With very, very little results,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=143s)** — if any. In fact, sometimes the treatment for Alzheimer's is worse. It can actually
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=149s)** — progress the condition. And so most of the research has been focusing on this
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=152s)** — theory that this amyloid placking is this metabolic junk that shouldn't be there. It has
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=157s)** — no purpose. We should just target and get rid of it. Well, it is true that there's amyloid
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=163s)** — placking involved in Alzheimer's, right? But amyloid placking would be equivalent to that
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=169s)** — match that starts to fire. Trying to wipe out the amyloid placking is going to be a waste
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=175s)** — of your time. The gene that makes this amyloid placking, which is kind of this fibrous
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=180s)** — tissue in the brain that ends up destroying the neurons in the brain, has been around for
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=185s)** — very, very long time, like 400 million years, because this gene is also an other species.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=191s)** — So why has it been unchanged in the genetics for this long? Unless there was a very important
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=198s)** — purpose of this placking. Well, incidentally, two researchers, which I'm going to put down
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=203s)** — below, stumbled on something that is just quite amazing. They found out that this beta
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=209s)** — very potent antimicrobial peptide, 100 times more potent than penicillin. Well, let me first give
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=217s)** — you some background. There's two parts of the immune system. You have the innate immune system
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=222s)** — that you're born with. It's the ancient first line of defense immune system, part of your army.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=229s)** — And then you acquire this other immune system. It's called the acquired immune system. And
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=235s)** — that's when you have all the antibodies and the T cells and the B cells and all these other
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=238s)** — things. And that usually is delayed. It takes time for your body to develop that. But in the
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=245s)** — brain, there is only the innate immune system. We don't have this other immune system in the
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=251s)** — brain because it might, maybe because it's just too powerful, it can create a lot of
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=255s)** — collateral damage and the brain is very sensitive. So this is what they found. They found
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=260s)** — that this amyloid placking is really an innate immune system reaction to a microbe that
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=270s)** — seeds or triggers this reaction. And so there's always this kind of this cascade between amyloid
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=277s)** — placking and this other thing called neurofibular tangles. Okay. So that's a mouthful.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=284s)** — Basically, if you look at that like fishing line, the placking and these tangles work
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=289s)** — together to entrap and contain pathogens. And so when they grab these microbes, right,
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=297s)** — let's say virus, they start to release certain chemicals. And one is bleach. Yeah, bleach.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=304s)** — And so that just kills the microbe instantly. Bam. Envision like this ball of fishing line.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=310s)** — That's just gets all fused and just gets all tangled around this pathogen. And so if you
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=315s)** — were to look inside this placking, you'd find this dead microbe, right? If there's
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=318s)** — anything remaining. And then because we have this reaction, okay, we get inflammation in the
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=325s)** — nerves. It's called neuroinflammation. And so now we have all this collateral damage that's
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=330s)** — occurring. Okay. And then we basically it's all reacting to dead nerve cells. Okay. So we have
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=336s)** — this whole cascade thing that's happening. Alzheimer's is an innate immune reaction
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=343s)** — to an infection. Now, usually that infection is not necessarily a full blown infection.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=351s)** — It's usually a subclinical infection that tends to brew in the oven. This is why placking
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=357s)** — usually develops over 20 years. And by the time you have the first symptom, you're at the
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=362s)** — peak of placking. Okay. And then it kind of goes down from there. And so the question is
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=367s)** — like, what seeds this whole thing? What is the triggers? Well, there are several really key
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=376s)** — pathogens that are associated with Alzheimer's. You have the herpes simplex one virus. Okay.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=384s)** — That's been known to trigger Alzheimer's. You also have spiral keats in Lyme disease.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=390s)** — You have something else called chlamytophilia, pneumonia, which is a microbe involved in
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=395s)** — And there's several others. And as far as someone having this gene susceptibility to Alzheimer's,
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=401s)** — that's that APOE4, which has a risk between 30 and 50% of getting Alzheimer's. Apparently,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=408s)** — if you have that gene, you're more susceptible to allowing the herpes virus to cross the
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=414s)** — blood brain barrier into the brain, which explains a lot. And so then this got me thinking,
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=420s)** — isn't there a microbiome in the brain? And apparently there's been this long-standing
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=427s)** — thought that, no, it's all sterile, just like the blood was sterile until they found out,
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=433s)** — no, it's filled with microbes. Well, the brain does have a microbiome. That's right.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=438s)** — And it's there probably to help protect you. Okay. And there's a huge relationship between
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=443s)** — Alzheimer's and an altered microbiome in your gut, but people don't talk about the brain. And
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=449s)** — there's just not a lot of research with this microbiome. What can we do about it? Right? Well,
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=456s)** — the most important thing is to do whatever you can to prevent it. There's some other things
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=461s)** — that are involved in this as well. Okay. Having a strong immune system, having a strong
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=467s)** — diversified microbiome, and also doing whatever you can to fix insulin resistance,
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=473s)** — which also makes you very, very susceptible. I mean, over 50% of the population has insulin
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=478s)** — resistance and that alone adds to the fire, the inflammation in the brain, not being on the
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=486s)** — ketogenic diet. Being on too many carbs adds more inflammation to the brain. You want to run
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=491s)** — your body on ketones that bypasses the whole thing. And so I think if you get it in time,
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=498s)** — you can turn things around really nice. Once you have it, it's just more difficult. I think
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=501s)** — you can improve it. It all depends on how much damage that's there. And the other thing is if
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=506s)** — you have this genetic weakness, this APOE4, you should definitely not be drinking alcohol,
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=511s)** — being exposed to smoking. Okay. You should be exercising, which will help the genes.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=517s)** — You should be doing keto. You should be eating extremely healthy things with antioxidants. So
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=523s)** — some other things to think about since 95% of the population has herpes, simplex one,
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=529s)** — okay, is to keep that darn virus in remission as much as you can, right? Do what you can to
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=535s)** — keep your body healthy. Because I've noticed people that get head injuries and go through
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=543s)** — major losses and stresses and then develop Alzheimer's, right? I think it kind of just
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=549s)** — activates what's already there. The herpes virus that kind of comes out of remission
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=554s)** — and then just makes things worse. So we have some key factors to look at. We have the
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=559s)** — epigenetic things you can do right now. Okay. And I have a lot of data on this,
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=563s)** — getting enough sleep, the exercise, keeping your stress low, eating extremely healthy,
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=568s)** — avoiding chemicals that can trigger this. If you keep your stress really low and keep your
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=573s)** — resistance high with your immune system, you can keep these viruses in remission. I think that's
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=578s)** — really the key, but there's also one more thing. If you also practice fasting, anyone
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=584s)** — who has Alzheimer's must be doing intermittent fasting, one meal a day, not two meals, but
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=591s)** — one meal a day. Why? Because you need a good amount of fasting to put your body into an
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=597s)** — autophagy situation. Autophagy is where your body is cleaning house. It's cleaning up old
- **[10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=601s)** — dead proteins. It's also strengthening your immune system. It's also bringing your inflammation
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=608s)** — down in your brain. It's also going to help increase your resistance to pathogens. And on
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPQ0bgqoq8&t=616s)** — that note, I have a great video on epigenetics right here. Check it out.
