- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=0s)** — I'm going to do a makeover of my studio and I'm going to show you behind the scenes of everything.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=9s)** — I'm hesitating showing you what this looks like. So just don't laugh, okay?
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=13s)** — All right, this is my makeshift crappy setup right here, which is totally embarrassing.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=20s)** — I know. But, you know, I had a studio in my other house, but we moved to this farm and I
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=27s)** — never got around to it. So I have this makeshift... this is my studio. This is where I do most of the
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=33s)** — film and I have this digital... oh yeah, this is... you probably thought this was real, right?
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=39s)** — And I'm still trying to figure out... this is bad. Come on, let's go. Okay, voila. And so
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=47s)** — I'll come in here and I'll turn on my lights. Okay, my camera. But look at this paint can.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=56s)** — This is ridiculous. Ridiculous. I need an upgrade. And so I'm going to call Bill and see if he can
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=62s)** — actually do a little upgrade. I don't really need anything too fancy. I just need a wooden table
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=66s)** — because these blocks need to go. Let's just get him on the line and see what he says.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=70s)** — Hey Bill. Hey Dr. Byrne. I have a little situation. Okay. Don't laugh. This is what I have as a desk.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=76s)** — Of the cylinder block? Yeah. And I got things propped up a little bit as a makeshift.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=82s)** — Never really got around to it. I'm assuming you need a new desk.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=86s)** — Just need something other than this plastic card table. Yeah, give me the dimensions.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=90s)** — We'll take care of it. We'll talk soon. Okay, cool. Anything is an upgrade.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=95s)** — Shoot this in the dumpster.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=106s)** — So we have the big reveal today. Today we're going to show you
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=110s)** — the new studio. We've been working on this all week. I'm really excited. I hope you will
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=115s)** — Typically my routine, I get up between four and four thirty in the morning and start doing research
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=121s)** — and then eventually shoot a video right around 12. Sometimes one, two, three, even four o'clock
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=127s)** — in the afternoon. Now they don't have a big team of people doing research. I do all of it.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=131s)** — It's a lot of work, but you need a good studio. And so now I have it right here.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=136s)** — Thanks to Bill. Check this out. This is a tree that fell in my pond. Yeah, so we actually
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=154s)** — took it. We milled it on the sawmill and then we kiln dried it and then we processed it,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=159s)** — which means we edged it. We planed it. We sanded it and then we put a coat of lacquer on.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=163s)** — It'll darken as time goes on, but it's just a different contrast. It's really,
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=168s)** — really pretty stuff. I love cherry. It's my favorite wood. It's gorgeous. So now
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=173s)** — this is the ultimate desk. I am so excited about doing videos now in a slightly better
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=179s)** — studio than I had before, which I'm embarrassed to even show you. So we have this couple of
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=184s)** — lights right here. And also we have this. Check this out. It's like looking down at Google Earth
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=192s)** — to the Grand Canyon, but we're not at the Grand Canyon. We're on my table.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=196s)** — So now I have this whiteboard that I can sketch things out. If I'm educating people
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=201s)** — about, I don't know, meta-pause, I can talk about how all the hormones go down except one
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=205s)** — called cortisol that goes up. That's why people, as they get older, lose their muscles.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=211s)** — So this can just allow a lot of different easy explanations without using the big board right
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=216s)** — there. But I'm just loving this table. How the heck did you come up with this idea? It
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=223s)** — really looks like a flowing river. I know it's lighted underneath, but how did you come up
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=226s)** — with this? I thought it would be cool to actually almost have something look like the Grand
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=231s)** — Canyon because you were telling me how the camera was going to drop down on it. But we
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=234s)** — started thick with the epoxy on that side and we kind of tapered it out to almost zero over here,
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=241s)** — which I thought was kind of cool. Just something I decided to do and put it on this cool base.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=246s)** — And yeah, it looks amazing from the down shot. I'm really impressed with it. Kind of cool.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=250s)** — No, this is like over the top cool. Yeah, it looks great. So for those of you that have not
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=256s)** — subscribed to his channel, definitely subscribe and check out the video on how he built this.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-pQNxUlAOI&t=261s)** — I'm going to put that up right here. Check it out.
