- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=0s)** — There's a lot of confusion on electrolyte powder. So I just want to clear this up.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=5s)** — It's actually a very interesting topic just to understand what an electrolyte really is.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=10s)** — So what is it? Well, an electrolyte is an electrically charged element or mineral.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=16s)** — What does that mean? It's basically a mineral that is free, allowing it to be an ion.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=22s)** — And what is that? Well, normally, if you've ever taken chemistry, you'll see that it has
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=26s)** — either a negative or positive charge around this mineral. Without getting too tactical,
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=32s)** — all you need to know is these minerals, when they're free, are ions, which means they can
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=38s)** — conduct electricity in water. So they have certain charges. And then the body can use these
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=44s)** — different charged minerals to allow movement. You can kind of think of it like a battery.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=50s)** — In a battery, you have minerals which are flowing electrons from one point to another,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=55s)** — creating this current. So electrolytes contribute to this electrical phenomena that occurs in the
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=62s)** — body. So I just want to give you a quick demo to really make sure you get this concept before
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=66s)** — we move on. So check this out. We have a light source. We have a power source. It's plugged
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=72s)** — into the wall over here. You can see the cords. And we have an incomplete circuit, electrical
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=78s)** — circuit. We cut the wire and we put the wire into distilled water. Distilled water is water
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=86s)** — without minerals and without electrolytes. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=92s)** — Okay, so we have no conductivity here. You can see there's no light. So we're going to take
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=97s)** — some electrolytes here, take a scoop of electrolytes, and we'll pour it in to this
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=106s)** — distilled water. And let's see what happens. And now we're going to mix it with the water to
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=114s)** — make sure it's dissolving. And look what's happening. We have a complete circuit now.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=122s)** — So one of the main purposes of electrolytes in the body is to power the nervous system,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=127s)** — which is the electrical system in the body, which powers the muscles and all the different
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=132s)** — organs. So now that you know that electrolytes provide the raw material to make things more
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=136s)** — electrical in the body, how does that really relate to the function of the body? Well,
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=142s)** — number one, it's responsible for nerve conductivity. Okay, the transmission of nerve
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=148s)** — impulses. And so if you have a problem with electrolyte, you have a problem with these
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=152s)** — impulses and it can affect the pacemaker of the heart. You can have palpitations.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=156s)** — You can have various nerve issues. You can have stress in the nervous system.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=162s)** — You can just feel stressed, like your nerves are stressed out. And where do those nerves go?
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=166s)** — They go to muscles, right? So you can have all sorts of muscle problems from muscle cramps
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=171s)** — during the day or at night, or even weak muscles. The movement of fluid through the body is
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=177s)** — dependent on these electrolytes as well. So whether you are dehydrated or hydrated depends
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=183s)** — on these electrically charged minerals in sufficient amounts and in the right balance.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=188s)** — For example, if you have too much sodium and not enough potassium, you will get fluid retention.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=194s)** — Also, pH is dependent on these electrolytes as well. So each part of your body is a
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=199s)** — different pH. And so if one part becomes too far to one extreme versus another,
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=205s)** — you can have all sorts of issues. And the different pH's of the body
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=210s)** — activate different enzymes. For example, if your stomach pH is not acidic enough,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=217s)** — certain enzymes will not be activated and you can't digest food. And then we have this very
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=224s)** — important and phenomena of electrolytes called the production of energy. So your energy level
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=230s)** — is highly influenced by these electrolytes as well. There's something called the sodium
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=236s)** — potassium pump. And this little pump is in all of your cells and it's dependent on
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=242s)** — sufficient amounts of sodium and potassium. And this pump allows the cell to become
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=248s)** — like a battery so it can store charge and 30% of all your energy is dependent on that pump.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=255s)** — And it's really easy to get sodium in the diet, but it's more difficult to get potassium
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=260s)** — simply because our potassium requirements are so high. We need like 4700 milligrams of
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=265s)** — potassium every single day. And the question is, where are you going to get that? You can
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=272s)** — don't because you would have to consume minimally seven to even 10 cups of salad
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=279s)** — with other foods to get this 4700 milligram requirement. So many people enhance their diet
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=287s)** — with electrolyte powders. So if you're deficient electrolytes, you can feel weak,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=291s)** — fatigue, brain fog, dehydrated, palpitations, dizzy. Why would you be dizzy? Well,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=299s)** — because of the hydration effect in your blood. So you have enough blood or volume of blood to
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=305s)** — maintain the blood flow up to your brain. It's kind of like if you were to give blood and take
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=310s)** — too much blood out and you wouldn't have the volume, you would feel very dizzy and faint.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=315s)** — So it's the volume of blood and the pressure, both by the way controlled by electrolytes,
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=320s)** — that can greatly affect many different things related to feeling dizzy when you stand up
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=325s)** — or even high blood pressure. There is a big correlation between low potassium and high blood
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=331s)** — pressure. I mean, you probably heard your doctor, if you have high blood pressure,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=333s)** — is going to tell you to avoid salt. But unfortunately, patients are not told to
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=337s)** — increase their potassium levels, which actually is more important. And if you're
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=342s)** — deficient in potassium, you can have cramps in your calves, especially when you're sleeping
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=346s)** — at night. All right, next topic I want to get into is how do you create a deficiency of
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=351s)** — Well, many different ways. By consuming refined carbohydrates or sugars, you'll retain sodium,
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=358s)** — but you'll deplete potassium, magnesium, calcium, and other things as well. Being
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=363s)** — under diuretic can cause you to become deficient in sodium as well as potassium as well.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=368s)** — Being stressed out with high levels of cortisol can deplete these electrolytes.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=373s)** — Having food with hidden MSG, monosodium glutamate, can deplete you of potassium.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=380s)** — You'll wake up the next day with a lot of fluid retention and not sure where that came from.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=385s)** — In that situation, the thing to do is to take more potassium as electrolyte to push out this
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=389s)** — excess sodium. Drinking too much water can deplete you of these electrolytes because they
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=395s)** — dilute the electrolytes, especially sodium, and you can create a condition called hyponatremia.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=401s)** — That's low sodium. And that could be very, very serious. Your brain can swell, you can go
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=406s)** — into a coma. So drinking too much water is not always the best thing to do if you want to be
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=411s)** — hydrated. To be hydrated, you need both fluid and electrolytes. Now, vomiting, diarrhea can also
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=418s)** — create a deficiency of these electrolytes. Being a diabetic, you're going to be deficient
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=422s)** — in these electrolytes, especially potassium. And if you're sweating, as in exercise,
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=429s)** — you can very easily end up with a electrolyte deficiency. So speaking about sweating and
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=435s)** — there's two general types of electrolytes out there. You have electrolytes that are more for
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=440s)** — sport type things involving minerals that replace sweat, and those usually are higher in
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=447s)** — sodium. And then you have other types of electrolytes, like this one right here, which
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=452s)** — is my brand, which of course I'm not biased on the quality of ingredients in this product,
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=457s)** — but this one, being a regular electrolyte, has very high levels of potassium, like a thousand
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=463s)** — milligrams of potassium, 75 milligrams of calcium, and 60 milligrams of chlorides,
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=469s)** — and only 40 milligrams of sodium per serving size. That's then compared to the sport version,
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=476s)** — which is 500 milligrams of sodium. So when you're exercising, you lose a lot of sweat,
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=481s)** — you lose a lot of sodium, so you need more sodium. But when you're not exercising,
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=485s)** — you don't need that much sodium. And so if you were to take a sport electrolyte with a
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=491s)** — and not exercise, you're going to end up with fluid retention. But on the flip side,
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=497s)** — if you take a regular electrolyte with low sodium while you're exercising with all this
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=503s)** — potassium, that too can create another imbalance. So the regular electrolytes should be taken
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=510s)** — when you're not exercising. Now, will it be a problem if you take this while you exercise?
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=514s)** — No, you just have to make sure that you take extra sea salt during the day to replace what's
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=522s)** — missing when you sweat. Now, I just want to show you the relationship between these three sport
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=527s)** — electrolyte beverages or powders. Okay, so of course we... I'll put mine up there. Now,
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=532s)** — if we take a look at Gatorade, it has 75 milligrams of potassium, and Powerade has 35
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=539s)** — milligrams of potassium. And Dr. Berg's sport electrolyte has 1000 milligrams of potassium.
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=545s)** — So you can see there's a huge difference in potassium. Now, what about sodium? Gatorade
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=550s)** — has 270 milligrams of sodium. Powerade has 150 milligrams. And Dr. Berg's sport electrolyte
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=556s)** — has 500 milligrams. And Gatorade and Powerade also threw in some phosphates or phosphorus.
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=564s)** — And I don't know the amounts because it doesn't tell you on the label. But basically,
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=568s)** — they're giving you three electrolytes, okay, with that product. And my sport electrolytes
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=573s)** — is giving you five electrolytes in much higher amounts with all of the trace minerals. And
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=579s)** — the biggest benefit is there's no sugar. It's with organic stevia with natural flavoring and
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=585s)** — no hidden maltodextrin, which I'm going to come back to in a minute. Gatorade, on the
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=590s)** — other hand, has not just sugar, but dextrose, which is a synthetic type of sugar, totaling
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=596s)** — 34 grams of sugar per bottle. 34 grams. That's a lot of sugar. And the interesting thing about
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=603s)** — sugar is it tends to deplete electrolytes, especially potassium. Powerade has fructose,
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=609s)** — giving you 21 grams of sugar. So Gatorade and Powerade has a few electrolytes and a
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=615s)** — lot of sugar. Now, of course, they're going to taste good. And they might appear to work.
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=620s)** — But honestly, it's just colored sugar water. And they probably use artificial colorings and
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=626s)** — probably artificial sweeteners. I don't know. I want to touch on this potassium just a little
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=630s)** — bit more. Potassium also helps with insulin sensitivity. If you're trying to lose weight,
- **[10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=638s)** — if you're trying to regulate your blood sugars, you want to make sure you have enough
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=642s)** — potassium because potassium can help those conditions. Potassium also regulates pulse
- **[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=649s)** — rate. If you're low in potassium, your pulse rate tends to go higher. Your blood pressure
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=653s)** — tends to go higher. And the other interesting thing about potassium is that it's part of
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=660s)** — the glycogen storage of sugar in your liver and your muscles. The way you store sugar is through
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=667s)** — all these little sugar glucose molecules strung together. And that's called glycogen.
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=673s)** — And you need potassium for every molecule of glucose to store it. So there's a lot of
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=679s)** — locked up within this glucose molecule, as well as a lot of water. In fact, there's three times
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=685s)** — as much water per gram of glucose. And then you have potassium with that. So when someone
- **[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=691s)** — is on the ketogenic diet and they get rid of a lot of the stored glucose as glycogen,
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=696s)** — they also can get rid of the fluid that comes with it. This is why they lose water weight
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=701s)** — within the first week or so, or two weeks, as well as a loss of potassium. And this is one
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=707s)** — reason why if you're going to start the ketogenic diet, you want to take electrolytes at the same
- **[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=713s)** — time to make sure you're not deficient in potassium and magnesium and other electrolytes.
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=718s)** — Now, one more really interesting thing about electrolyte powder that you probably have never
- **[12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=724s)** — heard before. You want to make sure that when you get electrolyte powder, it doesn't have
- **[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=730s)** — hidden sugars or starches or carbohydrates, as in maltodextrin. Maltodextrin is considered a
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=739s)** — starch, even though on the glycemic index it's higher than glucose. It's like way above a
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=745s)** — hundred. And yet it's not classified as a sugar, even though it behaves worse than a sugar.
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=750s)** — A lot of times you use the maltodextrin in the flavorings of a lot of these different
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=754s)** — products, both natural and artificial flavorings. In fact, I had to pay more for my flavorings
- **[12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqEO1Xc2P64&t=761s)** — of my different electrolyte powders to make sure that they did not include this maltodextrin
