- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=0s)** — Boy, if you have blood pressure problems, you're going to be pretty happy you watched this video.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=4s)** — I'm going to talk about why people have hypertension. The number one mineral deficiency behind this whole thing.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=11s)** — 90% of all hypertension is essential hypertension. What does that mean? It means unknown cause.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=19s)** — Which is very convenient for a drug company who sells medications for blood pressure.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=24s)** — Anti-hypertensive medication is right at the top of the list as far as most prescribed medications in the world.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=32s)** — First of all, what is hypertension? What is blood pressure? This top number, which is systolic,
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=37s)** — and the bottom number, which is diastolic. Normally it should be 120 over 80. And what
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=42s)** — this number represents is the contraction of the heart muscle that pushes the blood
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=49s)** — throughout the whole body down to the little capillaries where it then goes through veins
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=54s)** — and eventually ends up into the lungs where it gets re-oxygenated. So the top number is the
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=59s)** — contraction of the heart and the bottom number is the relaxation of the heart muscle.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=65s)** — Collectively together, this systolic and diastolic is a heartbeat. And when you have
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=71s)** — high blood pressure, there's some type of a resistance going on. It could be a blockage,
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=75s)** — could be a lot of things. But the point is that when you have any type of blood pressure issue,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=80s)** — it puts more stress on the heart. There's a lot of research in the relationship between
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=85s)** — a potassium deficiency. Personally, I think a potassium deficiency is behind a good majority
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=92s)** — of this essential hypertension. Why do I say that? Well, number one, most people are
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=98s)** — deficient in potassium. Why are they deficient? Because it's a bit hard to get potassium
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=102s)** — since the requirements are so high. Out of all the nutrients, potassium is the largest
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=109s)** — amount of nutrient that we need. We need 4,700 milligrams and an average person does not get that
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=117s)** — much. And the other interesting thing about medicine is that the whole focus is to reduce
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=122s)** — sodium for hypertension, right? But what about enhancing potassium? They don't really talk about
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=127s)** — what does lowering sodium do? Well, it indirectly increases potassium. We need about half the
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=135s)** — amount of sodium to potassium. And I think these ratios are more important than the amounts.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=141s)** — Many people are very heavy in the sodium, very low in the potassium to the point where
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=146s)** — they're like three times as much sodium to potassium. But what does potassium actually do
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=152s)** — to your blood vessels and your heart? Number one, it directly controls the tone of the
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=158s)** — vascular system, which is the neurotransmitter for the autonomic nervous system, which is
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=163s)** — directly connected to a high blood pressure situation because when you're running up a
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=168s)** — hill, you have adrenaline that kicks in to raise the blood pressure. Well, potassium lowers
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=173s)** — adrenaline. Potassium helps support the layer of the inside of the artery called the endothelial
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=182s)** — layer. And potassium also helps improve insulin resistance. It makes insulin more sensitive.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=189s)** — And what's wild is that when you go buy a potassium supplement, it usually comes like no
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=194s)** — more than 99 milligrams per tablet. How many tablets would you have to take to achieve 4,700?
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=201s)** — Now, there are electrolyte powders that have more than that. The other consideration that
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=206s)** — people have about potassium is that, oh, potassium is bad for the kidneys. That is
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=210s)** — completely false. Potassium is very, very healthy to the kidneys. It's protective of
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=216s)** — the kidneys. When you have advanced kidney disease, like a stage four, stage five,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=220s)** — that's when potassium can be dangerous. Now, this next thing I'm going to tell you is
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=225s)** — more interesting because if you look at the top medications for blood pressure, they all retain
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=234s)** — potassium. Interesting. Could it be that some of the positive effects of these blood pressure
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=240s)** — lowering medications could be because of the potassium effect? Now, where do we get our
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=245s)** — potassium from? Well, you can get it from salads, but you'd have to consume at least
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=250s)** — to make a dent into this potassium requirement. And the average person only consumes like a cup
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=256s)** — and a half. And also these leafy greens contain magnesium too. So the combination of both
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=263s)** — potassium and magnesium will greatly help the blood pressure. There's also data that in the
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=269s)** — prehistoric Paleolithic times, there's estimations that we consumed like 11,000 to
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=274s)** — 15,000 milligrams of potassium. Now, there's no way to know this for sure. It's just a good
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=281s)** — guess. But if you think about what we used to eat way back in the day, we pretty much ate
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=288s)** — whatever we could find. If we could catch an animal, we would eat it. If we couldn't catch
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=293s)** — an animal, I'm sure that we would eat vegetation or anything laying on the ground,
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=297s)** — like an acorn or anything. But when we consume refined foods, especially refined sugar,
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=302s)** — we lose potassium. When we increase adrenaline or cortisol, we lose potassium. So I have a
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=310s)** — challenge for you. I would recommend that you start to beef up your potassium consumption
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=317s)** — through salad. Just try it for one week and see what happens to your blood pressure.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=321s)** — If you can't seem to manage that much salad, then find a good electrolyte powder high in
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=326s)** — potassium. I think you might be pleasantly surprised of all the amazing benefits. Now,
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=331s)** — just to give you some visual on how much salad you should consume,
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyyaAek4jjU&t=336s)** — I put that in this video right here. Check it out.
