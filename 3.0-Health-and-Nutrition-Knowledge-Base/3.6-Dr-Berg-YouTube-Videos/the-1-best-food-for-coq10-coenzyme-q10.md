- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=0s)** — I'd like to discuss this very interesting, amazing molecule called coenzyme Q10. Now,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=6s)** — what is it and where do you get it and what food has the highest amount? Coenzyme Q10
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=11s)** — is a helper molecule that is inside your mitochondria that help you make energy,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=19s)** — ATP, in your cells. And it is in every single cell in the body. It helps in this
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=25s)** — transformation into ATP, as well as stabilizing the membrane and preventing
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=32s)** — any type of leakage of electrons. Now, if you think about a battery, a battery is filled with
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=38s)** — this energy that is filled with electrons. And if you had a hole in the battery and they
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=43s)** — leaked out, you'd get a dead battery. Same exact thing happens in your cells in relationship to
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=49s)** — Coenzyme Q10. If you don't have enough of it, you're going to have a loss of energy.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=56s)** — I think the best way to kind of help you understand the significance of Coenzyme Q10
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=62s)** — is to talk about what happens with statins. When you take a statin,
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=67s)** — you could generate this condition called statin-induced myopathies because statin
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=73s)** — drugs block the formation of Coenzyme Q10. Now, what is a myopathy? Like what type of problems
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=80s)** — can you have when you have a myopathy? Well, muscle pain, muscle weakness, and you're going
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=86s)** — to have an intolerance to exercise. You're not going to want to exercise. You're going to get
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=90s)** — tired real fast. Even if you like climb a stairs or climb a hill, you're going to run
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=95s)** — out of oxygen pretty quick. Coenzyme Q10 can increase the energy in your muscles,
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=103s)** — in your entire body. It can greatly reduce your fatigue, especially when you're exercising.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=109s)** — It actually can give you more oxygen when you exercise. So you're less winded. And it also
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=114s)** — can improve your repair when you exercise. So that's going to improve your performance.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=120s)** — Now, if you have congestive heart failure, you should definitely be taking Coenzyme Q10 or be
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=126s)** — eating the foods that are high in Coenzyme Q10, which I'm going to explain. But in one
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=130s)** — study with patients that had congestive heart failure, much less hospitalizations, especially
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=137s)** — from pulmonary edema, cardiac asthma, and arrhythmias. Now, another interesting thing
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=145s)** — about Coenzyme Q10, it gets transported through the body on a shuttle. And the name of that
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=152s)** — shuttle is LDL. That's right. That so-called bad cholesterol is the transportation of this
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=159s)** — Coenzyme Q10. It gets bound to it. It travels through the body. And without that LDL,
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=167s)** — it doesn't really go anywhere. It kind of just kind of lingers around and doesn't do
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=171s)** — so much. So we need the LDL. Now, another purpose of Coenzyme Q10 is its ability to act as an
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=178s)** — antioxidant. So it prevents the oxidation of LDL. So this is another benefit. It gives you
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=186s)** — this anti-atherogenic effect. So it supports the arteries. So that's pretty much what Coenzyme
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=192s)** — Q10 does. I mean, it does a lot of other things for your brain, for the different organs,
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=198s)** — but let's just talk about what food has the most Coenzyme Q10. It is heart muscle. That's right.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=207s)** — Which is an organ meat that very few people consume. Recently, we had one of our
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=214s)** — ous butchered and they wanted to know if I wanted to keep the heart muscle. And I'm like,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=218s)** — yes, I do. I definitely want to keep all the organs. So I'm going to freeze dry that heart
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=223s)** — and I'm going to turn it into freeze dried heart capsules. Okay. And that's one way I'm going to
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=230s)** — get my Coenzyme Q10. And I'll do a video on that to share my experience to see what happens.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=237s)** — But you can actually find some grass-fed heart or you can get it as supplements. Of course,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=242s)** — find a high quality source. But out of all the organs in our bodies and other animals,
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=249s)** — the heart has the most Coenzyme Q10. And so another good source of Coenzyme Q10 is in other
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=256s)** — organ meats like kidney, liver, brain. Coenzyme Q10 is also in fatty fish. It's even in
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=265s)** — extra virgin olive oil. When you exercise, you can increase the number of mitochondria that
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=271s)** — you have and you can indirectly increase the amount of Coenzyme Q10 that your body makes
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=276s)** — just by doing regular exercise. But a lot of people get their Coenzyme Q10 from supplements.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=283s)** — The challenge with Coenzyme Q10 is in its bioavailability. The absorption rate is like
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=289s)** — only 5%. There are other types of Coenzyme Q10 that are more bioavailable and one being
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=296s)** — something called ubiquitin. On the flip side, what are those things that could inhibit Coenzyme
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=302s)** — Q10? Well, I already mentioned statins, but there's other things like the normal aging process
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=308s)** — can decrease the amount of Coenzyme Q10, which could explain why the majority of the
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=315s)** — population on earth usually end up dying from a heart problem. But for anything connected to
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=320s)** — heart, Coenzyme Q10 is a great remedy that can help. There's other cofactors involved in
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=328s)** — this Coenzyme Q10 working in the mitochondria. So if you're deficient in vitamin C, for example,
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=336s)** — or vitamin B6, or folate, or alpha lipoic acid, you could actually end up having a
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=344s)** — lowered amount of Coenzyme Q10. And also anything that messes with your mitochondria
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=351s)** — will diminish Coenzyme Q10. And that includes diabetes, Alzheimer's, many, many different
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=357s)** — things. Dress is another thing that can diminish your natural pool of Coenzyme Q10. But I wanted
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=366s)** — to give you a quick summary of what Coenzyme Q10 is in a simple video. And if you want the
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=371s)** — complete information on supporting a healthy cardiovascular system, you should check this
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cty_MmAaMc&t=377s)** — video right here.
