- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=0s)** — If we take a look over the last 50 years and evaluate all of the foods that we've been eating,
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=8s)** — and we have consumed this one food in a massive amount. Check out this graph. So on the left here
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=15s)** — we have various different types of foods which I'm hiding right here. And we can see the relative
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=20s)** — amounts of certain calories, right? Compared from 1970 to 2014. You can see this one food
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=28s)** — here spiked over 8,000 percent. That's 8,853 percent. Compared to this food spiked 198 percent. This
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=40s)** — one 129 percent. And these are quite large, but nothing compared to this one food right here. Can
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=46s)** — you take a wild guess what you think this food is? Go ahead and comment down below. And it's
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=51s)** — not refined white sugar. The amount of this particular ingredient is consumed by the average
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=56s)** — American. That equals about 63 pounds. Most ultra processed foods have three basic ingredients.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=64s)** — The starches that includes maltodextrin, modified food starch, and modified cornstarch.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=71s)** — You have the sugar, which usually is in the form of glucose syrup, corn syrup,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=76s)** — or beet sugar. Then you have seed oils like corn oil, and soy oil, and canola. So I did
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=83s)** — mention this ingredient yet. Can you still guess what it is? I'll give you another hint. When you
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=88s)** — consume it, only one organ can break it down. And that is the liver. And this ingredient acts
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=96s)** — much like alcohol, even though it's not alcohol. In other words, the body has to get rid of it,
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=101s)** — and it uses similar pathways to break it down. And it produces seven times the glycation effect.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=107s)** — And glycation is when you have the combining of a protein to a sugar. And when you consume
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=111s)** — it, it suppresses hunger. It also depletes your vitamins and minerals. It's probably one of the
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=116s)** — most potent triggers to metabolic syndrome, a fatty liver, inflammation. Can you guess what it
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=122s)** — is? Let's take a look. Okay, high fructose corn syrup. That's right, high fructose corn syrup
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=130s)** — has spiked by over 8,000%. Let's take a look at the next one. Corn products. That would be
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=138s)** — corn starch. That would be the corn oil, but not necessarily high fructose corn syrup. And I do
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=144s)** — not think this includes the seed oils. All right, next one is skim milk has increased by 129%.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=153s)** — Then we get chicken, turkey. Then we get added fats and oils. Vegetables have been
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=160s)** — going down by 3%. Butter has been down training about 8%. And then we have eggs
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=166s)** — downtrending by 21%. Beef downtrending by 29%. So there's a lot of people against beef because
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=175s)** — they think it's the problem, but it's been decreasing by almost 30% over this time period.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=181s)** — And look at this, refined white sugar has been decreasing or downtrending by 35%
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=187s)** — over this time period. So high fructose corn syrup is very poisonous. You need to avoid it.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=193s)** — It's hidden in a lot of different foods and drinks and sodas and other processed foods.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=199s)** — You just have to start reading the labels. Unfortunately, we subsidize corn. So a good
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=205s)** — portion of the corn that these manufacturing companies use come from what's called dent corn,
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=211s)** — which is not even edible. They're even making milk out of corn right now. I'm not kidding.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=216s)** — Most of it's GMO, which means it's herbicide tolerant. You spray an herbicide on it like
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=222s)** — a phosphate and it doesn't die. Unfortunately, the US is the top producer of corn and the top
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=228s)** — consumer of corn. Corn has now replaced the consumption of rice in China. And most
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=235s)** — the corn sold in the US is sold for animal feeds. Unfortunately, they don't really use
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=240s)** — grass as much as they should. In 1930, farmers would extract about 20 and a half bushels
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=248s)** — of corn per acre. In 2022, farmers extract 173 bushels per acre. With the advent of all the
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=259s)** — different pesticides and GMOs, we can grow a tremendous amount of product in a very small
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=265s)** — area, which is not only not good for the environment, but not good for the soil,
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=269s)** — not good for our health. So as you start to read ingredients, not only avoid the
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=276s)** — fructose corn syrup, but also the modified food starch, as well as the modified corn
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=282s)** — starch and the maltodextrin and the glucose syrup and the seed oils. Now,
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-llgWDKEkM&t=287s)** — if we want to flip to the absolute best food you should be eating, you should watch
