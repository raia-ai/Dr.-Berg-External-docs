- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=0s)** — I'm going to show you the best way to get at the root cause of those dark circles underneath your eyes.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=7s)** — It's called periorbital dark circles. Now typically when you look this up you're going to see
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=13s)** — a million different remedies, okay? And they do work. The problem is they only work temporarily.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=19s)** — You have to keep applying them over and over and over. You can use kojic acid and you can
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=25s)** — vitamin C, aloe vera, niacinamide, which is a type of B3, or you can even use cucumber extract or
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=34s)** — cucumbers. So any of these will work temporarily. Simply take the remedy and rub it underneath your
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=40s)** — eyes and give it, you know, some days or even weeks. So what do all of these have in common?
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=46s)** — They inhibit melanin, okay, which causes this pigmentation in your skin. And that's cool. You
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=53s)** — can do that. There's probably not a lot of side effects, but I want to talk about the two underlying
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=59s)** — root causes to this problem. So you can actually permanently get rid of this. Now the first one
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=64s)** — involves understanding just a little bit about your hormone system, okay? You have this little
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=70s)** — gland in the brain called the pituitary and it sends signals down through the body. And one
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=76s)** — of the tissues that it controls is the adrenal glands. You have two of them deep into
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=81s)** — your abdomen, okay? The adrenal glands produce a lot of different hormones, but there's one that
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=86s)** — is called cortisol and that is a stress hormone. So the pituitary sends a signal down to the
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=93s)** — adrenal when there's perceived stress and that pituitary hormone is called ACTH. It hits
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=100s)** — the adrenal and then the adrenal produces cortisol. Once cortisol is produced, that amount
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=106s)** — of cortisol that is produced reaches up to the pituitary and tells the pituitary to turn off
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=112s)** — to stop producing this circuit. And so now that ACTH can stop being activated. Now it just so
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=119s)** — happens when you go through a period of stress called the chronic stress, which could include
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=124s)** — loneliness, losses, or anything to raise your level of cortisol like
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=132s)** — synthetic cortisol, prednisone, medications, etc. What's going to happen next is your body's
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=138s)** — going to develop this cortisol resistance, very similar to insulin resistance. And if you
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=145s)** — want to look this up, this is a real condition. Okay, it's called glucocorticoid
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=149s)** — receptor resistance. Now what happens in this situation is because of the excess communication
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=157s)** — coming down from the pituitary, that could be a bit too dangerous. So your receptors kind of shut
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=162s)** — down and inhibit the absorption of cortisol into the cells. And this is a protective
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=168s)** — mechanism. What's going to happen next is you're going to have a deficiency of cortisol.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=173s)** — So the communication is being sent, but it's not being received. So it's kind of like
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=177s)** — talking to someone, but they're completely ignoring you. So what are you going to do?
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=181s)** — You're going to start shouting at them, right? Eventually you're going to start talking
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=185s)** — louder. And that's exactly what the pituitary starts doing. It starts to increase its level
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=191s)** — of communication. Why? Because it's not getting through. Okay, your pituitary thinks that you
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=198s)** — have a cortisol deficiency, but in reality it's just resistance in the receptor. It's
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=203s)** — definitely deficiency, but it's because there's too much cortisol. So anytime you have too much
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=209s)** — CTH, you're going to have a big spike in this other hormone called melanocyte stimulating
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=217s)** — hormone. And that's where you get the increase in melanin, which is that darkening of your skin.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=222s)** — And very commonly it can occur right underneath your eyes. Now this is a problem because not
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=227s)** — only are you going to get this darkening underneath your eyes, but you're going to
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=231s)** — have all the other symptoms that come along with cortisol resistance. You see, cortisol
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=236s)** — helps you adapt to stress. Okay, put your body into a stress state to help you overcome
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=241s)** — a stressful situation. But now we have a situation that we have stress, but unfortunately
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=246s)** — without the benefit of cortisol. So now you get more inflammation in the body and that can
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=251s)** — happen on the skin as other problems. You're more susceptible to infection. Your immune system
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=257s)** — actually becomes very dysfunctional, etc. So what could be done with this cortisol deficiency
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=263s)** — that's really causing this problem? Number one, you have to do something about your stress. You
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=268s)** — have to reduce it in any way, shape or form. And I'm talking about the actual source of the
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=274s)** — stress, no matter what it is. And to flush out the stress, start increasing regular aerobic
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=279s)** — exercise where you're actually not producing a lot of stress, but you're running or flushing
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=285s)** — out all this adrenaline and cortisol out of the system. Actually, if you do physical work
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=291s)** — outside, that is even better than exercise because it also relieves the mental component
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=297s)** — to stress because it shifts your attention to something else. Far too often when someone
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=302s)** — works out and they're on the treadmill, whatever, or at the gym, they're thinking
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=307s)** — about these stressful moments at the same time, unfortunately. So it's really sometimes
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=312s)** — hard to extract the attention on that stress situation. Okay, the next thing is sleep.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=318s)** — Okay, get more sleep, take more naps, go to bed earlier, sleep in later. The next thing to do,
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=325s)** — and this is something that is very important, vitamin D3. Okay, I would take probably 20 to
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=331s)** — 30,000. I use a vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 acts like cortisol in the body, but without the
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=338s)** — side effects. So it can give you some benefits of this cortisol immediately. Magnesium is
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=344s)** — one of the most important minerals to take. And then also limit the amount of screen time.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=350s)** — Looking into the computer, that can really strain the eyes and it's just unfortunately not
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=355s)** — very healthy, even though we all do it. The next thing is reduce insulin. Okay, you see this
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=362s)** — in diabetics. Diabetics have this condition where they have kind of this dark,
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=367s)** — velvety skin in the folds of their body, sometimes around their neck, armpits. And
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=373s)** — what's happening is they have high levels of insulin and insulin resistance that is
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=378s)** — raising this melanocyte stimulating hormone. And this is a really easy one to correct if you
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=384s)** — understand what's happening. All you have to do is bring your carbs down to 20 grams or
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=392s)** — less per day. And then just not eat so frequently. Skip the snacks, skip breakfast,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=397s)** — and just have two or even one meal a day. Okay, you combine that with lowering your stress
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=403s)** — and you will see a lightning of these dark circles under your eye, which will then remain
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=409s)** — absent. I have a lot more to say on this topic. If you haven't seen
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT2zBPmcmsA&t=413s)** — this video on stress, you should check it out. I put it up right here.
