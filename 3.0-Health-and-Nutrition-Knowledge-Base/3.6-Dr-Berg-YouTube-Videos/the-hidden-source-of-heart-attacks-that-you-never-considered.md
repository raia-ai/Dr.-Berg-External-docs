- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=0s)** — So there's this hidden source of heart attacks that rarely does anyone know about. And this is a book by Thomas Levy, MD.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=11s)** — And so I'll put the link down below, but it was actually quite fascinating because I have personal experience with what I'm going to talk about.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=18s)** — Let me first jump to the smoking gun, okay? I'm going to tell you what he states in his book.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=24s)** — In 78% of 101 patients with myocardial infarctions, that's heart attacks, and occluded coronary arteries,
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=36s)** — they found DNA of pathogens typical for infections in root canal treated teeth. Now this is pretty wild.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=46s)** — I've talked about this briefly in another video, but the big question is what are these pathogenic biofilm microorganisms
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=53s)** — doing in your heart? How do they get there? And what's the relationship to your teeth? Now they also found
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=61s)** — these microbes also in the clots in certain stroke victims too. Just a quick story. I went to the dentist
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=70s)** — a while ago, and they're just doing a routine checkup and he had this really cool...
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=76s)** — so I think it was called a 3D cone beam imaging system where they basically can scan all the
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=82s)** — teeth and look deep inside for potential cavitations or like infections underneath the teeth. Now
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=88s)** — I was also an x-ray tech before I was a chiropractor, so I was interested in to see
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=93s)** — what was going on. And so when I was looking at my teeth, I noticed there was this like
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=97s)** — huge dark little circle around one of my tooth roots. Of course he looked at it and said
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=103s)** — yeah, you have a you have an infection going on in your tooth. Now I had no symptoms whatsoever.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=108s)** — So basically this infection, which is an abscess underneath a tooth, was eating away my bone. And
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=115s)** — so based on this book, it's the chronic long-term infection that can become a problem for people,
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=121s)** — not just for heart problems, but for arthritis and many other issues. Apparently it's quite
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=127s)** — common. If you look up the condition's name, it's called chronic apical periodontitis that
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=134s)** — many times doesn't have any symptoms. So basically as you're chewing in things, you're
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=138s)** — pushing this bacteria deeper into the lymphatic system in your jaw and throughout the body. And
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=144s)** — Dr. Levy points out some really interesting data. There's basically between 15 and 25 million
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=150s)** — people a year that get root canals. Okay. And his theory is that the root canal is where the
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=158s)** — problem is because when they do a root canal, they go in there, they take out some of the
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=162s)** — and they try to sterilize it and then they seal it. The problem is they also at the same time
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=169s)** — take out a lot of the tubules. You have like one or two miles of these small little tubes.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=175s)** — And so as you scrape away this, you take away the immune system as well. So here we have
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=180s)** — this potential for pathogens to create problems because it's nearly impossible to get rid of all
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=187s)** — the pathogens when they do this procedure. And so there's a high incidence of people with a
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=192s)** — mental abscesses and chronic inflammation of the root of the tooth or the gums and people who have
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=199s)** — heart attacks, which is actually very, very interesting. And many times this is missed on
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=204s)** — routine dental x-rays. One way that some people might pick it up is through a blood
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=209s)** — test looking at the C-reactive protein, which is just like a biomarker of inflammation.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=213s)** — This infection could be in the tooth, it could be in the gums, it could be deeper into
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=217s)** — jaw, and it can even be in the tonsils. It's the chronic exposure to these pathogens that create
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=224s)** — the problem, especially if your immune system is not strong enough to counter it because these
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=230s)** — pathogens are creating a lot of what's called oxidative stress. Okay, now oxidative stress is
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=237s)** — basically a situation where you have a lot of free radical damage, but we don't have enough
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=242s)** — oxidant reserve to counter that situation. I mean, think about how dirty the mouth is.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=248s)** — You have over 500 different strains of bacteria, viruses and fungus growing in your mouth. And
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=256s)** — then you also have this byproduct of the microbe, which is toxins that can then create
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=264s)** — more immune reaction, more inflammation in different parts of your body. Apparently,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=270s)** — one of the ways the body reacts to this situation is by developing clots. And so over time,
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=277s)** — when this becomes more chronic, a person is going to generally feel fatigue, chronic
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=282s)** — inflammation, jaw problems and sensitivity of the teeth. In my situation, I did notice
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=288s)** — when he removed the tooth, I immediately noticed my inflammation in my upper back and neck just
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=295s)** — disappeared. So that was fascinating. But if I didn't get that x-ray and see that cavitation,
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=301s)** — I never would have guessed that would be the cause. But basically we're dealing with a leaky
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=308s)** — bacterial overload situation that causes a compromise to your immune system. But let's
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=314s)** — just say, for example, someone has this infection and they feel a little tired,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=319s)** — but they don't really know if it's coming from this area or not. You feel like your
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=323s)** — immune system is compromised and you are wondering if you have this oxidative stress
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=328s)** — overload situation. What you could do is just take one or two grams of liposomal vitamin C.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=338s)** — It's not the vitamin C complex to fulfill a vitamin C deficiency. We're primarily using it
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=344s)** — as an antioxidant to lower the oxidative stress. And what's unique about this specific
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=350s)** — type of vitamin C is that it's one of the only ones that can go intracellular. I'd recommend
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=356s)** — taking maybe 500 milligrams several times a day. And this is because vitamin C is water
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=362s)** — soluble, so we just want to keep it flowing through your body. And the last point about
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=365s)** — this type of vitamin C is that it won't create diarrhea when you're taking large amounts like
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=371s)** — other types of ascorbic acid. But that would at least change the ratio of this antioxidant to
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=376s)** — the stress level to see if that might help you. And if it does and you feel a little bit better
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=382s)** — and you feel like your symptoms might improve, then you can start to dive deeper into why you
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=389s)** — might have this problem. Is it related to diet? Is it related to not sleeping? Is it related
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=393s)** — to over exercising? Is it related to a potential tooth infection? But this is just a
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=399s)** — short overview of this topic. I would highly recommend getting this book. It's filled with a
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=404s)** — lot more data. It's actually quite fascinating. So I'll put the link down below. And also, if you
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=410s)** — haven't seen my other video on atherosclerosis and this biofilm mechanism, I put that video
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykPs8tberw&t=416s)** — up right here. Check it out.
