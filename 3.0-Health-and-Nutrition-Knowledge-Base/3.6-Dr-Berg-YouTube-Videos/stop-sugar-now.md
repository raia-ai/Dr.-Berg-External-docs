- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=0s)** — Warning, sugar is actually destroying your brain. Sugar creates very similar effects to cocaine and heroin on certain parts of the brain.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=8s)** — And one study, if given a choice, a lab rat will go after the sugar more than the cocaine.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=13s)** — Sugar has the ability to alter hormones that literally puts you into this anxiety state when there's nothing around you to be anxious about.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=21s)** — But what comes way before that is a mild version of dementia.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=26s)** — You start losing your memory, which you just start forgetting.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=29s)** — And you're like, okay, where do I put my keys? You might have difficulty with names. You're not thinking clearly.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=34s)** — The last place that the sugar goes to is the hippocampus.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=37s)** — This part of the brain allows you to remember things.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=40s)** — And so when you're eating all this sugar and then eventually get pre-diabetes or diabetes, that all stems from sugar.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=47s)** — People will tell you that the brain needs sugar to survive.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=50s)** — And it is true that the brain can run on glucose.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=53s)** — The problem is when you do too much glucose, you start developing a blockage of the absorption of glucose.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=60s)** — If we take a look at how much glucose that's supposed to be in your blood at any one time, that's one teaspoon.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=65s)** — Here's the thing. People eat a lot more than one teaspoon of sugar. So where does it go?
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=70s)** — Insulin stores it, but then anything more is stored as fat.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=74s)** — A lot of the cholesterol that people have that's too high is coming from carbs or sugar.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=79s)** — What happens when you're eating excessive sugar, anything more than one teaspoon, is you start developing higher levels of insulin that has to do the heavy lifting.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=87s)** — But the doctors never test for this fasting insulin level because if they did, on an average person, they would find it to be very, very high.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=95s)** — What happens over time is that your pancreas keeps working harder and harder and you have more and more insulin.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=99s)** — And then the brain and other tissues of the body start to create this thing called insulin resistance.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=106s)** — When you have more than a teaspoon of sugar at any one time, the insulin is not working to pull that sugar out.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=113s)** — Then you start getting higher blood glucose and that's called diabetes.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=117s)** — You have so much insulin resistance, you can no longer pull in the glucose and feed the brain cells.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=123s)** — So the brain cells cannot get energy. And it wasn't even just the sugar. It was all the hidden sugar.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=128s)** — I'm talking about starch. Many times worse than actual sugar.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=131s)** — And then of course, you're drinking all this juice thinking, oh yeah, it's from oranges, right?
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=136s)** — Pure sugar. The most important thing that you could do with your diet is keep your carbs lower.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=143s)** — The low carb diet creates the most benefit and reverses diabetes within 10 weeks.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=150s)** — That should be in every newspaper, but you probably don't hear about it.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=153s)** — Here you have this sugar and starch, highly addictive. They put all these chemicals in it.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=158s)** — Anytime you eat anything with low protein, it's really hard for you to be satisfied.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=162s)** — When you lower your carbohydrates, you no longer are feeding the brain cells glucose.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=168s)** — Because you're now forcing your body to mobilize ketones, which is a completely different fuel from your own fat.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=175s)** — And that's going to feed your brain. It's going to bring up your mood.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=179s)** — You're going to be able to concentrate. You're going to have more attention.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=182s)** — You're going to learn better. You're going to have more capacity to remember things.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=184s)** — And that fatigue in your brain is going to go away.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=188s)** — Now, another little side note to this. I had my genes tested.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=194s)** — Apparently, my genetics show kind of a weakness in the area of being satisfied.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=199s)** — If I don't consume enough fat or protein, I will literally never be satisfied.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=205s)** — So the combination of all the carbs and the frequent eating and the snacks, really bad.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=210s)** — Until one day I discovered that if I consume more protein,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=215s)** — I could be more satisfied and not have to snack.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=219s)** — Protein is the solution to this carb problem.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=223s)** — Having enough sufficient protein and fat will get rid of your cravings and decrease the need for snacking.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=229s)** — It's not necessarily just about cutting your carbs.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=232s)** — It's what you're going to replace it with.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=234s)** — And I'm talking about replacing with grass-fed meat.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=236s)** — You can do eggs. You can do fish.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=238s)** — But I'm telling you, this protein with the fat that normally comes with it will quickly reverse
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=244s)** — and help correct this insulin problem.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=247s)** — And that brain fog will go away so fast.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=250s)** — This is one of the most simple, most amazing things you can recommend to someone
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=256s)** — is to make sure they have enough high quality protein with the meal without the carbs.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=261s)** — You do have people that are so used to eating junk food,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=263s)** — it's really hard to have them make the transition.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=266s)** — But there's some really cool things that you can eat that will be very close or mimic what you have been eating.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=273s)** — Let's just take, for example, fat and sweet.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=276s)** — Okay, at the end of the meal, you can get some Greek yogurt, no sugar.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=280s)** — There's certain brands of chocolate that don't have any sugar.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=283s)** — There are a ton of recipes to do alternative breads, pasta, cereal.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=289s)** — All of the flour products can be replaced by a healthier version.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=293s)** — This is not about depriving yourself.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=296s)** — This is about just replacing it with an upgrade.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=299s)** — There are recipes that you can make like the butter chicken, the Indian dish.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=304s)** — That's so delicious that you go to this Indian restaurant and you have this butter chicken and it's so amazing.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=310s)** — Of course, they put tons of sugar in it.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=312s)** — There's recipes and I'll put one down below that virtually tastes identical to that.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=316s)** — But there's no sugar in it.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=317s)** — There's just spices and it's delicious.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=319s)** — So you can enjoy your food, but without the sugar and without the snacking.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=325s)** — Yes, the brain can live on sugar, but it doesn't need a lot.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=328s)** — Very similar to a plant.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=330s)** — It needs water, but what happens when you overwater it?
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=332s)** — It dies.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=332s)** — And that teaspoon of sugar that's needed for your blood can be created from your liver, from things that are not sugar.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=340s)** — So you really don't need any sugar.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=342s)** — In summary, the most dramatic thing you could do to reverse cognitive problems, lowered emotional mood issues, brain fog,
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=352s)** — is by cutting out the sugar, the hidden sugar, starches,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=356s)** — and replacing it with high quality protein with the fat.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqk7MOeKAXg&t=359s)** — Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.
