- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to talk about skin diseases and dermatitis. Dermatitis comes from the word
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=4s)** — derm, which means skin, itis, inflammation of. There are many, many different types of dermatitis.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=13s)** — And I just want to share there's a common denominator with every single one of these
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=18s)** — conditions. But here's the thing, you have this skin inflammatory condition. There's redness,
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=24s)** — there's itching, might be blisters, there might be flakiness. Each one has its own scientific name.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=30s)** — But in this video, I'm going to make this whole topic extremely simple. And I think it could be
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=35s)** — very useful for anyone who has any type of skin problems. I mean, you have contact dermatitis.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=41s)** — Contact means you come in contact with it and you get some itchiness or some rash. And then
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=45s)** — you have something called atopic dermatitis. Then you have something that's called saboreic
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=50s)** — and the derivation comes from a word that means discharge or flowing. And you have many
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=57s)** — different types of dermatitis, like in plainness, in pitigo, candida, dermatitis, psoriasis,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=64s)** — eczema. So you have all these very scientific sounding descriptions of various symptoms that
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=71s)** — revolve around your skin. But basically when it boils down to skin problems, you either have
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=76s)** — reaction to something like an allergy reaction, or you have some type of immune reaction that's
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=81s)** — reacting to bacteria, a virus, a fungus, etc. Many of the symptoms from skin conditions
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=89s)** — are really coming from our own immune system that is reacting to something. So you can
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=96s)** — consider a lot of these conditions as an overreactive immune system. So what's the most
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=102s)** — common treatment? Steroids, topical or oral. It suppresses the immune system. And then of
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=110s)** — course the next most common treatment is an antibiotic. So you kill only bacteria. And this
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=115s)** — is why many times you end up with a secondary infection, an overgrowth of candida, an overgrowth
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=121s)** — of fungus, mold, or yeast. What you need to know is the superficial part of your skin is
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=129s)** — a universe of bacteria, microbes, all different types. It's called commensal relationship, where
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=138s)** — they don't bother you, you don't bother them, and everything is just fine. And then the skin
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=142s)** — itself is a barrier because right underneath the skin you have a huge network of lymphatic
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=150s)** — tissue, blood vessels, capillaries, which is just filled with immune cells ready to protect
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=157s)** — against foreign invaders. So what's the common thread or problem in all of these conditions?
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=162s)** — They all seem to significantly respond in a positive way to taking vitamin D. For example,
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=169s)** — when you have hives from something called contact dermatitis. So you got this itchiness.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=175s)** — Well, vitamin D inhibits the cells that make histamine. They're called mast cells. Vitamin D
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=182s)** — lowers the histamine response. Vitamin D is the main regulator or controller of your immune
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=190s)** — system. And even if you look at almost every single one of these skin problems are worse
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=195s)** — in the winter. What a coincidence when we have the lowest amount of vitamin D. They're
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=200s)** — also worse under stress. It just so happens when you raise cortisol from stress, you
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=207s)** — can take vitamin D and take vitamin D. Now, even with acne, for example, that involves the
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=212s)** — sebaceous gland, when you take vitamin D, it can help shrink and normalize the sebaceous
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=218s)** — gland and help regulate the overproduction of that oil. One version of that, if it's on the
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=226s)** — scalp, is dandruff. And you can use vitamin D cream to successfully treat dandruff. Eczema,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=234s)** — psoriasis, vitiligo, as well as alopecia are all related to having a vitamin D deficiency. In fact,
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=240s)** — it's usually the low vitamin D that triggers an autoimmune disease. But here's the interesting
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=245s)** — thing about microbes. Because if you have a type of infection on your skin or anywhere in
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=250s)** — your body with a microbe, what some of them do is they start to reduce the vitamin D
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=256s)** — in your skin. And ultimately, that's the end point where vitamin D can connect and be
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=264s)** — activated. And if the microbe can keep that not working that well, then the microbe can survive.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=271s)** — But also, I found out that certain fungi will do it as well. The real solution is just to
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=277s)** — take more vitamin D. Vitamin D increases a certain enzyme that helps you make melanin. And
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=284s)** — it's the pigment in your skin. So when you're deficient in vitamin D, you're more susceptible
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=290s)** — to vitiligo. Vitamin D has a very potent anti fungal effect. It directly inhibits
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=299s)** — fungal growth from preventing the development of a fungal infection to preventing biofilms,
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=305s)** — which is a condition where you have microbes that start to develop these little calcium
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=310s)** — cells. But vitamin D helps prevent the biofilms. Even when you don't have enough vitamin D,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=317s)** — your skin becomes drier and less hydrated. And this whole area of dermatology seems to be very,
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=323s)** — very complex. But there's a common theme between almost every single skin disorder,
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=329s)** — and that would be a vitamin D deficiency. And since we're on the topic of autoimmune
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=333s)** — conditions on the skin, if you have not seen this video on psoriasis, check it out. I put
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPRzN4kTWI&t=338s)** — it up right here.
