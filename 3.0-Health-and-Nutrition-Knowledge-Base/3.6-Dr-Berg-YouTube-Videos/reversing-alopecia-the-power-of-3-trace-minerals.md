- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=0s)** — Today's topic revolves around the number one missing trace mineral in arthritis. For arthritis,
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=8s)** — a lot of people are taking vitamin D and they may not see the difference. Other people take a lot of
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=15s)** — magnesium for the joints and they also might not feel much difference unless they have this
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=22s)** — additional trace mineral involved. And that is boron. Now let me explain what boron is.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=28s)** — It's a trace mineral that we don't have a lot of studies on, but there's a lot of data relating
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=33s)** — to arthritis that I'm going to share with you. Boron seems to be the key trace mineral to allow
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=40s)** — calcium to work, to allow magnesium to work. If you're deficient in boron, you're going to have
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=48s)** — excess amounts of calcium and magnesium in the urine. You're going to tend to get more
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=52s)** — calcification in the soft tissues. You're not going to have the strong bones. So boron really
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=59s)** — helps keep the minerals inside the bone and allows vitamin D to be activated and help this
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=65s)** — whole process work. Boron also prevents tooth decay like in tooth cavities. If you don't
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=72s)** — have enough boron, you're going to have more inflammation in the joints because boron helps
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=77s)** — reduce something called C-reactive protein. You may even find that you're getting receding gums
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=82s)** — kidney stones, calcium in the arteries and calcium in the joint because you're deficient in boron.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=88s)** — The tissue that contains or stores the most boron is something called the parathyroid gland.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=94s)** — Let me explain very simply what the parathyroid gland does. It sees four small glands around
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=100s)** — your thyroid and what the parathyroid gland does is produces a hormone that helps control
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=106s)** — calcium. So let's say for example you don't have enough vitamin D or you don't have
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=110s)** — calcium. Well the parathyroid hormone will increase to extract the calcium from your
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=117s)** — bone, pull it out so you have enough calcium. So you can look at the parathyroid hormone as
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=125s)** — kind of like another vitamin D. And what's interesting about the parathyroid hormone is
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=129s)** — you need this boron to allow this whole thing to work. Even if your levels of vitamin D
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=135s)** — are normal in your blood, you might have vitamin D resistance. And this is where the parathyroid
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=141s)** — hormone starts going higher and higher and higher. Even though you're taking vitamin D.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=146s)** — Well it's because you have vitamin D resistance, but it can also be you're short in boron.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=152s)** — So I think a lot of people are deficient in boron because they really haven't put it on
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=158s)** — the radar as being something they need. Also if you're low in boron, you're going to have
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=162s)** — amounts of testosterone. You're going to have low amounts of estrogen. Now when doing a deep dive
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=169s)** — into nutrition, I always look at research on animals, right? Because sometimes with humans,
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=177s)** — the research is kind of like hidden and buried. But for animals, it's usually out there. And
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=182s)** — I found something interesting with horses. If a horse is deficient in boron, their head starts
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=187s)** — shaking because they have a problem with the trigeminal nerve that causes pain and inflammation.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=193s)** — And they're trying to do something to get rid of it. Well magnesium in boron gets rid of it
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=199s)** — pretty quickly. There's even data that boron can help decrease the risk of prostate cancer.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=206s)** — As far as the amounts of boron to take, I would recommend starting out with like three
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=213s)** — milligrams three times a day. And see if your problem is resolved after a period of one to three
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=219s)** — months. Now some people take a lot more boron just so you know. Like some people take like
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=224s)** — 30 milligrams a day. You have to realize that the toxicity level of boron is less than salt.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=229s)** — And the heavy tilling of our soils have depleted a lot of these trace minerals,
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=233s)** — including boron. So I just wanted to put boron on your radar just so you know it's
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOAgbJvhqg&t=238s)** — out there. And when it does there's a little more data to know about arthritis. If you
