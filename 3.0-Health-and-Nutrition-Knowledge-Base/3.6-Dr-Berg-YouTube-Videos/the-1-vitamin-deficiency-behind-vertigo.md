- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about vitamin B6 deficiency symptoms that you have never heard before.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=6s)** — Now, the data I am going to share with you is out of this book right here.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=9s)** — One of my favorite books, Laboratory Evaluations for Integrative and Functional Medicine.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=16s)** — It is amazing because it covers every aspect of nutrition in depth.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=22s)** — So, I have tore this book up many times, so it is fantastic.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=26s)** — Now, what is interesting about B6 is that if you look this up, they will tell you it is very rare to have a deficiency.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=32s)** — And they never talk about this idea of subclinical deficiencies of nutrients.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=37s)** — Instead they focus on these major deficiency symptoms.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=40s)** — But this is going to be an interesting topic. Let me just kind of go through it.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=43s)** — Most people might know that if you are deficient in B6, you will typically have rashes around your nose.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=49s)** — You might have cracks or rashes around your mouth.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=52s)** — You might even get pink eye as a symptom.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=55s)** — You can get anemia as well as neurological problems, which involves numbness in the bottom of your hands and your feet.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=63s)** — Which typically come from a B1 deficiency, but also from a B6 deficiency.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=67s)** — Some people might know that you can get depressed if you are deficient in B6.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=71s)** — But today I want to talk about all the other problems that you can end up with if you are low in B6.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=76s)** — But first let me just kind of give you some interesting information about B6.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=80s)** — Vitamin B6 is involved in over 140 different enzyme pathways.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=87s)** — So you can imagine how broadly this vitamin extends into our bodily functions.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=91s)** — And yes, there are toxicity symptoms. But typically B6 is a water soluble vitamin.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=97s)** — So you would have to consume over a thousand milligrams of B6 to have some problems.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=104s)** — Now typically there are no side effects if you are taking less than 200 milligrams per day.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=111s)** — But the side effects start going up if you get over a thousand.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=114s)** — And the main side effect will be neurological issues like neuropathy.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=119s)** — So neuropathy can come from a deficiency of B6 and too much B6.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=124s)** — But rarely do I know anyone taking over 200 milligrams per day.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=128s)** — Now the other interesting thing about B6 deficiencies is it can be used as an indicator for inflammation status.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=137s)** — It's highly correlated for C-reactive protein, which is an inflammatory biomarker.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=143s)** — And people, especially with gut inflammation, IBS, have low levels of B6.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=149s)** — And when people talk about B6, they are really talking about a collection of a group of different compounds
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=157s)** — that are precursors to the active form of B6.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=161s)** — And the active form is P5P. I won't get into the long name. You don't need to know that.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=166s)** — But when you see the form P5P, that is the active form.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=171s)** — The other forms are like precursors that have to turn into this active form.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=175s)** — And the food to achieve the best bioavailability of B6 would be from beef, pork, fish, and chicken.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=184s)** — Dairy and eggs are not the best source. And even plant-based B6 is not the best source.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=191s)** — So here are the symptoms that very few people know about that are related to a B6 deficiency.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=196s)** — I just mentioned inflammation, so let's put that on the top of the list.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=199s)** — So inflammation, especially of the gut, could be related to a B6 deficiency.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=204s)** — Number two, B6 helps control polyunsaturated fatty acids.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=209s)** — Those are the ones that I always tell people to avoid, like from corn oil, soy oil, canola, cottonseed oil, things like that.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=217s)** — And also if you're consuming a lot of these oils and you can't metabolize it because you don't have enough B6,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=222s)** — this can lead to the dermatitis rashes that I mentioned when I first talked about this.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=228s)** — Number three, B6 is intimately involved in making neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=235s)** — And you can imagine all the symptoms that can occur from having a deficiency of neurotransmitters.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=241s)** — So in other words, B6 is necessary to make all of these neurotransmitters.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=246s)** — So it can affect your mood, it can affect having addictions, it can affect your general state of just nerve communication.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=253s)** — Number four, B6 is involved in the conversion from something called ALA to DHA.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=260s)** — Now what is that?
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=261s)** — Walnuts have a good amount of ALA, which is a precursor to the active form of the omega-3 fatty acid.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=268s)** — So let's say, for example, you don't consume a lot of fish or fish oils or cod liver oil,
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=273s)** — and you're doing a lot of walnuts thinking that you're getting all the necessary precursors to make your omega-3 fatty acid.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=281s)** — Well, without B6, you might not be able to convert this as well.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=286s)** — And this could lead to more inflammation.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=289s)** — Alright, the next one, number five, B6 is necessary to make selenium work.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=294s)** — Now selenium is involved in a lot of other things, from making glutathione
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=299s)** — to involved in converting your thyroid hormones from the inactive to the active.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=304s)** — So you can see indirectly that B6 deficiency could lead to all sorts of other deficiencies
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=309s)** — related to a lack of selenium doing its work in different enzymes.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=314s)** — Number six, B6 is necessary to convert tryptophan into niacin.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=320s)** — Number seven, B6 is necessary in a lot of different things related to amino acids.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=326s)** — One of the things that can occur as a problem is alopecia, hair loss, because you don't have enough B6.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=332s)** — In another study, I found that B6 is intimately involved in an enzyme
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=338s)** — that if you're deficient, you can have a higher risk of getting seizures.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=343s)** — If you know anyone who has seizures, you should make sure they're consuming more B6.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=350s)** — Another thing that B6 is needed for is lowering homocysteine,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=356s)** — which can affect your heart in a negative way.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=358s)** — Typically, people might know to reduce your homocysteine, you take enough B12 and folate,
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=364s)** — but B6 is also necessary as well. Let's say someone's deficient in B6,
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=369s)** — and they also have a problem with their gut microbiome.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=373s)** — They're greatly more susceptible to having autism than if they just had a B6 deficiency
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=378s)** — and they had good microbes. In other words, there's this whole gut-brain interaction
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=384s)** — that can influence symptoms of autism, especially if you're deficient in B6.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=393s)** — Does it all come from diet? Actually not.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=395s)** — A portion of this B6 comes from your own microbiome in the large intestine making B6,
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=403s)** — just like it makes a lot of other B vitamins.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=406s)** — So this relates to one of the reasons why people are deficient in B6
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=411s)** — when they take antibiotics, especially for things like TB, because of this lack of B6.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=417s)** — Anyway, I would just recommend if you know anyone with autism,
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=420s)** — make sure they're taking the active form of B6, P5P, as well as taking a good probiotic.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=428s)** — And just to give you a little more information about that, B6 helps regulate or suppress gut pathogens.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=437s)** — So those are the symptoms, but how are people deficient?
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=440s)** — Well, eating too many processed foods, also taking diuretics.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=444s)** — Certain medications like high blood pressure medication can create a deficiency.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=447s)** — Taking certain antibiotics, also being on birth control pills, drinking alcohol.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=454s)** — If you're pregnant or lactating, also smoking creates a deficiency.
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=459s)** — Certain herbicides, as in glyphosate, in all the GMO foods.
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=463s)** — And even taking high levels of an herb called Ginkgo biloba can create a deficiency,
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=468s)** — but you'd have to take quite a bit of that compound.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=470s)** — Now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube,
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=475s)** — it's becoming more difficult to find my content.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=478s)** — And there's a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29NS6PxfE2s&t=482s)** — So to make sure you have full access of all my information,
