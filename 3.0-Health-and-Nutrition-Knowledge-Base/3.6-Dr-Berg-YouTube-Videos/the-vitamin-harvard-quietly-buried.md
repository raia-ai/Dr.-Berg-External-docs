- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=0s)** — Big Pharma is terrified of vitamin D3. They have great influence over universities, especially Harvard University.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=7s)** — Harvard will not publish anything positive about vitamin D. The question is why? Because it competes directly with Big Pharma.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=15s)** — Many, many, many conditions that Big Pharma treats can be inexpensively corrected with vitamin D.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=21s)** — Let's just start with the precursor for vitamin D, cholesterol. The precursor to make vitamin D has also been attacked.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=27s)** — This is seed oils, right? Heart healthy. Why? Because it doesn't have any cholesterol. It's cholesterol free.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=34s)** — What about the sun? Has anyone ever told you to stay out of the sun? You're going to get skin cancer.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=38s)** — I want to share some interesting data with you. There's two main Big Pharma companies, Leo Pharma and another one that's called El Miro.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=45s)** — Both of these pharmaceutical companies specialize in dermatology, skin related issues.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=51s)** — Both of these companies have developed products in the past that had the ingredients of synthetic vitamin D.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=58s)** — One drug they combined vitamin D with corticosteroid cream. Another drug was just vitamin D.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=63s)** — And what were these for? Skin problems. These are the two companies that started this sun phobia, stay out of the sun campaign.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=70s)** — While they sell you their vitamin D products. Out of all the remedies that you can do for eczema and psoriasis, the sun is one of the best remedies.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=80s)** — And it causes the cholesterol in your skin to turn into vitamin D.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=85s)** — The most dangerous skin cancer, really stemming from a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=89s)** — It usually originates in areas that are not exposed to the sun.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=93s)** — You really need at least 10,000 IUs every single day to maintain a healthy vitamin D level.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=100s)** — Every aspect of your immune system has receptors for vitamin D.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=104s)** — Back in the early 1900s, we had sanitariums all over the world to get sunbathing, sun treatment.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=111s)** — They would basically lay out the sun to prevent TB and to handle various health conditions.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=117s)** — Until we developed something called antibiotics. And then you saw those sanitariums go away.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=123s)** — The amount of corruption and influence of big pharma has been widespread ever since that period of time.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=129s)** — I want you to hear a very short clip by Dr. William Grant, who has done extensive research in the area of vitamin D.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=137s)** — It's interesting to look at the number of papers published on vitamin D to give you an idea of how important vitamin D is.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=145s)** — According to PubMed.gov, there have been 84,532 papers published with vitamin D in the title on or abstract as of February 18, 2024, including 4668 in 2024.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=157s)** — The rate of publication has been greater than 4,000 papers per year starting in 2014.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=163s)** — Thus, it is the most studied bioactive molecule. Despite this record, there's still controversy regarding its health benefits.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=170s)** — Why the controversy? Well, big pharma and the medical system are not happy with vitamin D because it reduces their income and profits.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=180s)** — I listened to a presentation about the disinformation playbook by a representative of the Union Concerned Scientists and learned about the five pillars of the playbook.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=191s)** — These pillars include the fake, where counterfeit science is conducted and is tried to be passed off as legitimate research.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=201s)** — The main example of this for vitamin D is all the government-sponsored vitamin D randomized controlled trials, which are designed based on guidelines for pharmaceutical drugs, not nutrients.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=214s)** — And as a result, they don't show any benefit of vitamin D.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=218s)** — Then there's the blitz, harassing scientists who speak out with results reviews inconvenient for industry.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=225s)** — Back in 2018, there was a big hit piece on Michael Hollick in the New York Times saying, well, you can't be trusted because you took money from indoor tanning industry and the supplement industry.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=236s)** — Come on, give me a break.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=237s)** — The diversion, manufacturing uncertainty about science where little or none exists, again using the results from clinical trials to counter the results from observational studies.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=249s)** — Fourth, the screen. They buy credibility through alliances with academia or professional societies.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=256s)** — Well, Big Pharma funds all the medical universities to fund clinical trials, gives them lots of money and encourages them to ignore vitamin D.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=266s)** — And all your disease organizations take money from Big Pharma and of course represent their interests and are more interested in maintaining a membership base of people with disease rather than curing them.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=283s)** — Finally, there is the fix, manipulating government officials or processes to influence policy inappropriately.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=289s)** — As is well known, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health have had major influence from Big Pharma.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=299s)** — That has changed in 2024 and this should result in changes regarding the acceptance of vitamin D.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=308s)** — There's tens of thousands of research studies on what vitamin D can do for cancer.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=313s)** — I mean, it's not a trickle of research, it's a flood of research and that's just cancer.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=319s)** — Vitamin D doesn't just help cancer one way, it's many different ways.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=322s)** — A lot of the research that shows that vitamin D doesn't help are on purpose.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=328s)** — In other words, I think Big Pharma has influenced a lot of the research on these topics.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=334s)** — All you have to do to sort that out is to look at the studies that don't show a favorable outcome.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=339s)** — And almost in every one of the studies, the amount of vitamin D that they use is so tiny.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=345s)** — And when you use just small amounts of vitamin D, you're not going to be able to create the effects.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=349s)** — Dr. Coimbra from Brazil, who developed the Coimbra protocol for autoimmune diseases, the results of using high doses of vitamin D3, it's in the 90 percentile as far as effectiveness.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=360s)** — And in a recent interview, which I will post, he told me this, that there's something called vitamin D resistance.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=366s)** — And this has to do with a genetic issue with vitamin D.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=371s)** — If your genes have some type of problem, you are vulnerable to having a vitamin D deficiency because there really is no test that you can know for sure if the vitamin D in your blood is going deep into the tissues, into the cells.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=387s)** — You may be seriously deficient or vulnerable to having an immune problem like some autoimmune disease.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=394s)** — This is also why it's so important to make sure that your vitamin D is at least 50 nanograms per milliliter.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=401s)** — I'll put the link down below where you can order a kit and you do a little blood spot on a piece of paper, send it in, and you can find out your vitamin D levels.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=408s)** — I think a lot of people have a problem with vitamin D just because their genetics are not allowing them to absorb vitamin D.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=416s)** — Even from the standpoint of what vitamin D does for inflammation, it can greatly reduce inflammation.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=423s)** — It's one of the most potent anti-inflammatories to protect you from getting cancer as well as viruses and things like that.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=429s)** — Cod liver oil also has a good amount of vitamin D.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=431s)** — One tablespoon of cod liver oil can give you 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=436s)** — That's 20 minutes in the sun. If you haven't had your vitamin D tested, it's probably a good idea to get it tested.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=441s)** — And if you want more information about doing a home test, I will put that link down below.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XiDJCG4zs&t=444s)** — But ideally, I would recommend to make sure your levels are above 50 nanograms per milliliter.
