- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=0s)** — Today we have something very interesting with Justin Richard. Now, if you haven't watched
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=6s)** — Justin's videos in the past, you have to check them out. I'll put his link down below. But
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=10s)** — he does this channel with evaluating his blood sugars on a continuous basis. And the type of
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=16s)** — information that he has found with experimenting with different foods is amazing. We're going
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=21s)** — to share with you some fascinating data about what happens with different foods. And if you
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=29s)** — check your blood sugars over a period of time, rather than just a one-time test,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=33s)** — what you're going to reveal. So welcome, Justin. Thank you very much. I'm super pleased to be
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=39s)** — here. I'm a big fan of your content. I've been watching you for many, many years.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=44s)** — And I'm happy to be here. Thank you. Awesome. I stumbled on your video and it gets right
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=53s)** — the point. And you use this continuous glucose monitor and you just basically
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=60s)** — test out all these different foods. Let's just dive in and just talk about some of the things
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=65s)** — that surprised you that you would never think would create that big of a spike. But I think
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=70s)** — just before that, what I need to mention is what we're testing. Because if you're new to
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=75s)** — this channel, I'll just kind of explain what we're testing. So anytime you eat certain
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=80s)** — foods, especially carbohydrates, depending on the type of carbohydrate, the blood sugar is going
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=85s)** — to either go slightly up or really high. And then it will eventually come down, hopefully.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=94s)** — And so what's happening is we have different hormones that come in there and help regulate
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=98s)** — your blood sugars like insulin. And so when you don't get this leveling off, there could
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=109s)** — be more pre-diabetes. And a lot of people have that. So that's kind of my introduction.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=114s)** — So jump right in, Justin. Well, it's really the most important factor for me was insulin
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=122s)** — resistance. And I have a history of type 2 diabetes in my family. Ants and uncles
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=126s)** — have it. My mom has it. And my whole reason for starting this channel was I wanted to do
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=133s)** — something to preempt this scenario. I don't want to end up with type 2 diabetes. And as I was
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=141s)** — in my late 40s, I was noticing that I was getting low energy year after year. My energy
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=146s)** — levels were diminishing year after year. And especially after I ate food and particular foods,
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=153s)** — highly processed, sugary foods, this really took my... it zapped my energy. And I was
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=159s)** — having a hard time working through the day. And given the history of type 2 diabetes in my
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=164s)** — family, I realized that I needed to do something quickly to get this under control because I was
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=171s)** — on that road to diminishing my health year after year. So that's the reason I did this.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=179s)** — And I'm so grateful that I did get the CGM because it really takes the guesswork out of
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=187s)** — managing your blood sugar. And there are a lot of surprises that happen along the way. You
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=192s)** — realize what these foods are actually doing. In particular, these highly processed sugary
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=200s)** — foods, they really have a great impact on your blood sugar levels. And it really is an
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=207s)** — eye-opener when you get this CGM and you really see what's going on.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=211s)** — Yeah, CGM is the continuous glucose monitor for those of you that
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=216s)** — didn't quite understand what that is. But yeah, that's awesome.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=221s)** — Yeah. So, you know, when I first got it, I was just continuing what I was eating just to see
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=229s)** — what the foods that I would commonly eat were doing to my blood sugar. And I ate a lot of
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=237s)** — a lot of baked goods. Baked goods are my favorite thing. I grew up with them and I am not ashamed
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=243s)** — to say that I believe I have a sugar addiction to a certain degree. I crave sugar quite often.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=251s)** — It's hard for me sometimes to say no to sugar, especially these baked goods and things like
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=255s)** — that. So when I first got the continuous glucose monitor, I was just testing out
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=259s)** — what these foods that I commonly ate are doing to my blood sugar. And it was a
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=265s)** — shocking surprise that these are really high elevations in blood sugar for me.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=270s)** — And also they had quite a long duration. So that's not something that I wanted to continue.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=276s)** — So it really brought this to light for me. And I started to alter my diet accordingly. Now,
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=284s)** — I do want to mention as well too that I still eat sugar from time to time. But I've
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=289s)** — cut back that intake significantly. So if someone eats sugar, obviously it's going to go up.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=297s)** — What surprised you the most? What kind of food that you ate? You're like, wow,
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=301s)** — I had no idea it spiked that high. Well, besides the obvious sugary treats and
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=307s)** — stuff like that, white flour, any even bread or even whole wheat breads for me
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=313s)** — really spiked my blood sugar more than I thought they would. For some people,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=317s)** — that may be different. That may be potatoes or rice for other people if we're off the track
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=324s)** — of the highly processed foods. Those are the standard foods that a lot of people are eating
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=329s)** — all the time. They have a significant impact or they can have a significant impact. So for
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=334s)** — me, it's that white flour, anything with white flour, that's pasta, breads, things like that.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=341s)** — Then you're going to get people a little sad, well, I'm going to have whole wheat bread
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=345s)** — versus white bread. Have you ever tested those two? I've tested that. There's a minimal
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=352s)** — difference between the two. It's all highly processed. A lot of that is marketing. They
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=357s)** — tell you that it's brown bread and it's really not that much different. I've also tested
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=364s)** — sourdough bread and not much of a difference. Then of course, there's the argument that
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=369s)** — the bread that you buy, the sourdough bread that you buy at the grocery store is not
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=374s)** — authentic sourdough. That requires a fermentation process that you usually only get at a bakery.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=382s)** — So I went to a local bakery. I got the authentic sourdough bread and it did not have
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=388s)** — that reduction that I was hoping for. So a lot of these things that you see and read online,
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=395s)** — you really have to test them for yourself because they may have studies behind them
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=400s)** — but not everybody reacts the same way. Unfortunately, it's not entirely accurate
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=408s)** — when you're taking those into account. I've tried freezing bread to increase the
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=413s)** — resistance starch overnight, freezing it and toasting it. It has a slight difference but
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=419s)** — all in all, these breads or these flowers really have a high impact on the blood sugar for me,
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=431s)** — at least anyway, and many people as well too. Darn it. What about Ezekiel breads? People are
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=438s)** — going to wonder about that sprouted bread. Have you tested that? I do. And that's my go
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=443s)** — to bread. I use that all the time. It seems to have the smallest impact on my blood sugar
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=448s)** — with the breads. Part of the reason is because the slices of that Ezekiel bread are a little
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=453s)** — bit smaller as well too. So that's something to take into account. But it is a healthier
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=458s)** — bread when you read the ingredient list and it's lower on the glycemic index than most breads
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=463s)** — that are using this white flour. So it is a good choice for me and all the recipes that I do
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=470s)** — that when I'm trying to cut back on the glycemic load, I use the Ezekiel bread.
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=475s)** — Interesting. So I have a question. So, you know, we talked about sugar, but if we take a look
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=483s)** — sugar and then we deduct the fiber and the sugar from it, we have what's called the net
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=487s)** — carb. People don't really know what that is. But I'm just going to tell you right now,
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=493s)** — for those of you watching, it's a starch, right? So sometimes you'll see
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=497s)** — products like this right here. Doritos. It has zero sugar, right? Zero sugar.
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=504s)** — So it must be okay. But have you ever tested maybe, I don't know, like a starch potato versus
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=513s)** — modified food starch or a starch, a refined starch like this, like really refined?
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=518s)** — Yeah, generally products like that that have corn as the ingredient really spike my blood
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=524s)** — sugar as well, too. They're generally really high on the glycemic index. And they can be
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=529s)** — me. So I try to avoid those as well, too. There's a lot of
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=534s)** — seed oils in those fried foods as well, too. Those are deep fried as well. So there's some
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=541s)** — issues with that for me as well, too. So I try to stay away from that. So it's not only
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=545s)** — about the blood sugar for me. I'm trying to eat healthier all the way around. Blood sugar is
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=549s)** — one of the things that I'm trying to watch. But I do consider things like that as well, too.
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=554s)** — Well, you know, you were into the pastries, bread stuff. I was into the salty chips in college.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=562s)** — I would do a much bigger bag of Doritos in one sitting. But this right here doesn't seem
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=566s)** — like that much, right? So this is 14 serving sizes. Okay, 14. So you think anyone's going
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=573s)** — to have one 14th of this in one sitting? So if we just multiply the hidden sugars,
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=580s)** — which is the refined carbs and starch in here, this is how much sugar you're getting
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=586s)** — in this one bag. Yeah, that's incredible. It's just... and it's so deceiving.
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=594s)** — These foods are so highly palatable. These companies that manufacture these take a lot of
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=599s)** — time to get their recipes to have the maximum effect on your biochemistry to make you crave
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=606s)** — them more and more. I did some research on Doritos and they actually hook people up to
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=613s)** — a brain scanner to see how their brain is reacting to these chips when you eat them.
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=620s)** — And they're looking... they have their whole set of terminology. They're looking for the
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=623s)** — bliss point. So when you eat something, it's the right amount of dopamine that keeps you
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=628s)** — coming back for more of these chips. It makes this stuff really, really hard to resist. And
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=634s)** — that's why, like me, a lot of people are hooked on this stuff and it's hard to get off it.
- **[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=640s)** — When you're comparing that food to a healthy food like broccoli, it's difficult to say,
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=648s)** — oh, I like the flavor of that broccoli better than these Doritos. It's a hard thing to
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=653s)** — shake when you're up against that. But part of understanding what is happening when
- **[11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=662s)** — you're eating that and having that data of your blood sugar can really show you
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=669s)** — what is going on. And that can scare you straight, so to speak. It can say, you know
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=674s)** — what? The consequences of me eating this stuff are not as... they're not good and I need to
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=680s)** — start doing something about it. When you start to get those symptoms later in life,
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=685s)** — you have to make a decision. Say, do I want to continue down this path
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=689s)** — or do I want to do something to make myself feel better and to regain my health that I once
- **[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=695s)** — had when I was younger? But that's the battle is trying to stay away from these highly
- **[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=705s)** — processed foods, increase the consumption of the whole foods that are high in fiber,
- **[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=711s)** — rich in nutrients, vitamins and minerals, and low in this highly refined sugar that
- **[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=717s)** — we're getting a lot of. So that's the challenge that I faced. And I think a lot of people face.
- **[12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=722s)** — That's what gets a lot of people in trouble with their metabolic health is this food addiction.
- **[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=728s)** — We all have our favorite snacks. We all have our favorite foods. Ice cream for some people,
- **[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=732s)** — potato chips or baked goods or chocolate, whatever that is, those are highly addictive foods.
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=739s)** — And they can really do a number on your blood sugar. There's a book called, I think,
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=745s)** — Dorito Effect. And what's interesting, they talk about the history of it. They manipulate
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=750s)** — the food to give this spike in burst of chemical, joy, dopamine, but then it drops
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=758s)** — really fast. So it's almost like, I need another one. It's like, I fell for it for years.
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=764s)** — I was in the trap. It took me a very long time to eventually come off those things,
- **[12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=771s)** — even if I was like, my stomach is in pain. So I know a lot of people are stuck in that trap.
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=778s)** — The advantage of this continuous glucose monitor is that you can't really necessarily know
- **[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=785s)** — what's going on other than just feeling it like with your blood sugars. But now you can
- **[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=789s)** — actually really see it and measure it. But without measuring it, you can't really control
- **[13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=795s)** — it. So be able to see the effects, not just like right after the food, but even hours later
- **[13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=802s)** — is super valuable, especially since not just food can affect your blood sugars.
- **[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=810s)** — For me, a lack of sleep can increase my fasting blood sugar levels by 10,
- **[13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=816s)** — 15, even 20 points the next day. And my insulin sensitivity is not as good as well,
- **[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=822s)** — so when I do eat the carbohydrates, I'll spike higher and for longer periods of time.
- **[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=827s)** — Sleep is a big factor. Stress is also a big factor. And everybody says that,
- **[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=832s)** — but nobody really understands the real consequences of that. When you have the
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=835s)** — continuous glucose monitor, you can see on the graph, oh, my fasting blood sugar level
- **[14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=841s)** — is actually up 15 points today because I only got five hours sleep last night or highly
- **[14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=848s)** — It really is something to see that because you don't consider that it would have that much of
- **[14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=856s)** — an impact. But when you see it, it's significant. Another thing that having the continuous glucose
- **[14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=863s)** — monitor that is an advantage is this test your blood sugar every five minutes. So it's
- **[14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=868s)** — like doing a finger stick every five minutes, 24 hours a day. So you get a chance to see your
- **[14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=878s)** — I used to eat a couple of hours, one hour before bed sometimes. And if I eat something like
- **[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=886s)** — pizza or popcorn, caramel popcorn, I've done some tests on my page with that and went to
- **[14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=892s)** — sleep, my blood sugar will spike 50, 60, 65 milligrams per deciliter. And it will stay up
- **[14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=899s)** — for six, seven hours all through the night. And I would never have known that had I not
- **[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=906s)** — the continuous glucose monitor to show me what's going on overnight, because you're not going to
- **[15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=910s)** — get up every five minutes and prick your finger to do the test. So that information is valuable.
- **[15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=917s)** — And that is enough to say, look, I am not going to be eating late at night before bed,
- **[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=924s)** — especially high carbohydrate meals like that. Now my rule is I try to give myself three to
- **[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=928s)** — four hours before I go to bed to digest that food. And I also try to make my last meal of
- **[15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=935s)** — day more of a keto style, low carbohydrates, higher proteins, higher fats. So if I am hungry,
- **[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=941s)** — I can still satiate myself, but I'm not going to do these high carbs because going to sleep
- **[15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=948s)** — with a full stomach of carbohydrates is not good for my blood sugar.
- **[15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=952s)** — You said six hours.
- **[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=955s)** — Six, seven hours even.
- **[15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=957s)** — Oh my gosh.
- **[15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=957s)** — Yeah. And I'm not even considered type two diabetic. But that is alarming when you see that
- **[16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=966s)** — because you've got your stomach is filled with these carbohydrates. You're not active.
- **[16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=972s)** — You don't have a chance to burn these calories off while you're sleeping as
- **[16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=976s)** — much as you do when you're up and you're active. So that revelation to me really made
- **[16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=981s)** — a big change with my behavior. I try not to eat. I do eat carbohydrates throughout the day
- **[16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=987s)** — sometimes I fall off the wagon and I eat these highly refined foods. But now I do them with some
- **[16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=995s)** — very specific hacks or ways to mitigate those blood sugar spikes in mind. I keep that in mind.
- **[16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1002s)** — So I'm not going to eat those high carbohydrate meals before bed. If I am going to have some
- **[16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1007s)** — carbohydrates, I'll include some proteins and some fats and something fibrous to help slow
- **[16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1013s)** — down those carbohydrates.
- **[16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1015s)** — So let's talk about that. So what we want to do... it's getting impossible to say,
- **[17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1022s)** — no, you never can have this for the rest of your life. But if you do, there's things you
- **[17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1026s)** — could do to buffer this insulin response. So let's talk about that. So you found fiber
- **[17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1032s)** — will do it, right? Fiber. So if you're going to have a salad or something before a meal
- **[17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1037s)** — or even vegetables, raw vegetables, things like that, even having an apple can help as well,
- **[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1046s)** — too. If you're just going to eat a chocolate bar by itself, I get a pretty big spike. But
- **[17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1051s)** — I've done some tests on my page where I've had some hard boiled eggs before that,
- **[17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1056s)** — or some broccoli before that. And I've done the test. It can bring...
- **[17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1060s)** — So are you saying protein also can help?
- **[17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1062s)** — These three things, fats, fibers, and proteins, they have a significant impact.
- **[17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1066s)** — They slow down the rate at which that food moves through your digestive system.
- **[17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1071s)** — And that can reduce the blood sugar spike, the post meal blood sugar spikes. So I've tested
- **[17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1077s)** — each of them individually, proteins, fats, and fibers. They all do a pretty good job.
- **[18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1083s)** — But if I'm going to have a chocolatey treat or a piece of cake or something like that,
- **[18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1091s)** — I can have proteins, fats, and fibers beforehand. It fills me up so I'm less likely to eat more
- **[18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1100s)** — of the junk food that I'm going to eat. And it helps to dampen or bring down that blood
- **[18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1106s)** — sugar spike from that highly processed food. So that's a good rule of thumb that I've been
- **[18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1111s)** — incorporating. You can also take supplements. You can also take apple cider vinegar,
- **[18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1116s)** — which I know you've talked about. That has acetic acid in it, which helps to slow down
- **[18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1121s)** — that digestion process as well. That can bring a blood sugar spike down by as much as 30%.
- **[18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1127s)** — That really works. Wow. Wow. I mix a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water.
- **[18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1132s)** — You drink that right before your meal, and it can really help to reduce that blood sugar spike.
- **[18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1137s)** — I wonder if that's why some people unknowingly take a piece of bread, toast it, add butter,
- **[19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1144s)** — and then cinnamon to help buff for the response. I don't know if that would do anything, but
- **[19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1148s)** — that would be an interesting test. Yeah. And also, when you look at the sequence
- **[19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1152s)** — of how people eat their meal, they usually start with a salad. Then they have the meal
- **[19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1157s)** — and they finish with dessert. Well, that is the correct way to eat. And that may have been
- **[19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1164s)** — developed or recognized over the years of tradition. You eat your salad first,
- **[19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1169s)** — your meal, and then your dessert last. That is going to slow down the absorption or the
- **[19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1175s)** — digestion of that sweet treat at the end. So that's the proper sequence to eat things.
- **[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1180s)** — It's to save the sweet treats for last. And plus when you eat a salad, because if you eat
- **[19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1184s)** — the protein first, and even the salad after that, I noticed that people don't finish their
- **[19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1190s)** — salad because the protein is the biggest satisfier, not the salad. So I always have
- **[19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1197s)** — salad first. Not everyone does that, but I think that works for me. When we talked before,
- **[20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1203s)** — you had a great tip. You know, just to minimize the temptation and try to do a lifestyle that
- **[20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1210s)** — this stuff is not in your face all the time. So let's talk about like
- **[20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1214s)** — tips that people can do that can minimize even the exposure of this junk food.
- **[20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1220s)** — Other than just seeing, wow, my blood sugars are high, but what else can we do?
- **[20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1224s)** — It's true. It's all about developing habits for me. So all this time that I spent eating
- **[20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1232s)** — these junk foods all through my life have become habits for me. So I want a sweet treat after
- **[20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1238s)** — a meal. I want something sweet in the morning. It's all about changing those habits from bad
- **[20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1244s)** — habits into good habits. So I work on one or two at a time. The last one I've been trying
- **[20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1249s)** — is obviously don't go to the grocery store. And this is simple. These are simple habits
- **[20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1253s)** — that we've all probably heard before, but when you use them, they actually can really work.
- **[20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1258s)** — Don't go to the grocery store when you're hungry. Go after you've eaten some food. You
- **[21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1262s)** — make better choices there. And it's important for me when I do see something at the store
- **[21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1268s)** — that I want to buy like something that's sweet, donuts or something like that. I say no to
- **[21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1273s)** — it at the grocery store because at the grocery store, I only need to say no to it one time.
- **[21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1278s)** — If I bring that item home and I put it in my fridge or my cupboard, every time I open the
- **[21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1283s)** — fridge, I have to say no to that. That might be four, five, six times a day. I say no to it
- **[21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1289s)** — once at the grocery store. Don't bring it into your environment. Don't make it easy to
- **[21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1294s)** — access that food. That's a really important tip. And if you can implement that and stick
- **[21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1300s)** — with that little habit, it can have a significant impact for the rest of your life.
- **[21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1306s)** — Developing even simple little things like that can make big changes. If you're going to
- **[21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1311s)** — have a big meal, another great one is you know you're going to eat a big meal. There's a high
- **[21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1316s)** — carbohydrate load. Go for a 10-15 minute walk after that meal. That can have a really
- **[22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1322s)** — significant impact to help bring that blood sugar spike down or keep it at a nicer level.
- **[22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1329s)** — So walking just like that 10-15 minutes is a really good habit to start doing. And those
- **[22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1335s)** — small little things that most people can do, it's free and they have a significant impact.
- **[22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1341s)** — I like that. Yeah, because the first 30 minutes of walking, you're burning up all your extra
- **[22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1347s)** — sugar and your blood. So that's very important. But I'm going to use that because
- **[22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1352s)** — what you said before, because yeah, like if you buy it, it's in your fridge. Now you
- **[22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1357s)** — have to constantly say no every single day. Every single night, you're like, no, no, no.
- **[22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1361s)** — It keeps calling out to you. You know, when I was in my 20s and then 28, I think that's when
- **[22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1369s)** — I got married and then early 30s, right before keto, I couldn't sleep. This is probably my
- **[22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1377s)** — late 20s. I couldn't sleep. So the only way I could sleep is have a pint of Ben and Jerry's
- **[23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1383s)** — ice cream before bed. You can imagine my blood sugars. And I think now looking back,
- **[23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1388s)** — it was a sugar coma. Like, you start spiking the sugar too high and it's going to put you out.
- **[23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1393s)** — Of course, I'd wake up like I had a hangover. But at least it helped me sleep because I had
- **[23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1398s)** — the restless legs from the vitamin B deficiency that was created from all the carbohydrates.
- **[23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1403s)** — So I was in that mode for quite some years. And it wasn't until and I don't know if this
- **[23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1410s)** — happened to you or not. But, you know, there's a certain point in your life where
- **[23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1413s)** — you make a shift of like, okay, I'm going to change my diet. And then you realize,
- **[23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1418s)** — oh my gosh, I feel better. It was when I added protein for breakfast instead of my
- **[23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1424s)** — carbohydrate, big, huge muffin, and my orange juice. I don't know what you did. But
- **[23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1431s)** — I had a protein breakfast. That was like the biggest simple change that made me feel
- **[23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1435s)** — better. What about you? What did you do? I started to do intermittent fasting. So I started
- **[24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1443s)** — 16 eight intermittent fast. So all the tests that I do, by the way, are after a 16 hour
- **[24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1448s)** — fast on an empty stomach. So I've put that into my life. And that's something that I can
- **[24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1453s)** — stick with rather easily. So I'm never usually hungry first thing in the morning. So that was
- **[24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1458s)** — an easy habit for me to pick up intermittent fasting. And then I started after that, I
- **[24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1463s)** — started to add protein into the first meal of the day. So about 30 to 40 grams of protein,
- **[24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1469s)** — I found that when I did that, I was satiated. I had better energy levels throughout that whole
- **[24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1475s)** — morning or after breaking the fast, usually around noon. So after eating protein,
- **[24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1481s)** — including that, that made a significant difference. And then of course,
- **[24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1485s)** — what were you eating before that? Oh, donuts and junky stuff, sugary, sugary,
- **[24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1491s)** — like breakfast cereals. Breakfast cereals are so high in sugar and they really spike blood
- **[24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1496s)** — sugar. So, you know, and that's what everybody does. You grow up with cocoa puffs and fruit
- **[25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1503s)** — loops and all these things and you think that's normal. That's a normal diet for a lot of
- **[25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1507s)** — people. And we're unknowingly spiking our blood sugar significantly first thing in the morning.
- **[25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1513s)** — And when you do that first thing in the morning, that sets you up to be hungry
- **[25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1517s)** — and tired for the rest of the day. Setting your biochemistry up with a proper meal
- **[25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1524s)** — first thing when you break your fast really has a positive effect for the rest of the day.
- **[25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1530s)** — So I find that when I do the test, like the other day was national donut day. So I said,
- **[25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1535s)** — all right, I'm going to do two donuts. I'm going to eat two donuts. I'm going to test them.
- **[25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1539s)** — So I did it after my 16 hour fast on an empty stomach. It had a pretty big blood sugar
- **[25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1544s)** — spike there. But for the rest of the day, I was tired. I was craving more sugar. I wanted
- **[25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1551s)** — more. I wanted more sweets. So that first meal of the day is really, really important.
- **[25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1557s)** — And I discovered that. Did you... how was that? Well, just have you noticed a big change from
- **[26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1564s)** — in your mood, your overall mood when in the past versus when you are doing good foods?
- **[26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1571s)** — Yeah. And for me, my mood is really directly correlated with my level of energy.
- **[26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1576s)** — So if I have low energy, I don't feel like doing anything. And I'm not productive. When
- **[26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1582s)** — I'm not productive, I say, why am I not doing this? Why am I not motivated? And that can get
- **[26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1587s)** — me down because I don't feel productive. And I feel like I've lost the day. It can bring me
- **[26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1592s)** — down a little bit. I've also experienced some anxiety if I have too many carbohydrates.
- **[26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1598s)** — But that energy level was a big thing for me. I was getting... after I would eat a meal,
- **[26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1603s)** — any of these meals, I would get so tired, I would be falling asleep in my chair, literally.
- **[26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1610s)** — So it has a direct effect on my energy level, which in turn has an effect on my mood.
- **[26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1615s)** — Getting that under control has been a real game changer in my life. That energy level
- **[27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1622s)** — is where it all started for me. I realized, you know, late forties, it started mid to late
- **[27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1627s)** — year after year, just getting tired, just tired every day and not having the energy that I once
- **[27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1634s)** — had. And I said, what is going on here? And then I was researching insulin resistance.
- **[27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1639s)** — And that's one of the symptoms. When you start to lose your energy, you're not using
- **[27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1643s)** — the food properly. It's not metabolizing properly. And your blood sugar levels are
- **[27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1649s)** — altered, making you tired. A lot of things go on with that. And that really has a
- **[27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1654s)** — significant impact on a lot of people. You know, you don't have the time and energy,
- **[27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1658s)** — you don't have the energy to do what you want to get done during the day. You don't have
- **[27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1661s)** — the energy to connect with the people in your life that you want to. That has a serious
- **[27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1666s)** — impact besides your health. Massive. When you were growing up, were you like a serious
- **[27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1675s)** — junk food junkie or were you moderately eating poorly and then just snacking and then kind
- **[28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1680s)** — of going through your 20s? Like what severity were you at as far as junk foods?
- **[28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1684s)** — I would say, you know, I've been 40 pounds heavier than I am now. And you know, I would
- **[28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1689s)** — say I have a sugar addiction. I would say that and I think a lot of people do that. I think
- **[28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1696s)** — a lot of us are afraid to admit that. But I would find a lot of pleasure in going to the
- **[28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1702s)** — store and buying a variety of junk foods and going home and eating them. That was a real
- **[28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1707s)** — treat for me. I felt really good. Would you also do like healthier foods too at the same time?
- **[28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1712s)** — Like growing up? Not then. Not at that time. Growing up that was a way for me to have
- **[28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1719s)** — like a guarantee that I would feel good. I would go to the store. I would buy some
- **[28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1724s)** — chocolate. I would buy some potato chips and maybe a soda and then I would come home and I
- **[28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1729s)** — would eat them. I would really get a lot of delight out of that. So it was a way for me
- **[28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1736s)** — too. I'm sorry. Did you have it in your house too? Was there always junk food in the house?
- **[29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1741s)** — Well, not so much when I was very young. My mom didn't do that. But when I got out on my own,
- **[29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1747s)** — when I got... I remember when I got my first job, I was 12. I was doing some stuff and I
- **[29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1751s)** — had my own income. I could go to the store and buy this stuff that I wanted. And for me,
- **[29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1757s)** — it was just a real treat. And you know, looking back on that now probably was, you
- **[29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1763s)** — know, I was just looking at myself in some way. But yeah, I am still drawn to those foods.
- **[29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1771s)** — And every once in a while I do fall off the wagon. Like the other day I did the donuts and
- **[29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1775s)** — I said, wow, these really are good. But again, knowing the consequences of that really
- **[29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1783s)** — put things into perspective and it really can hold you accountable for that.
- **[29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1788s)** — You know, you could just schedule those days on the days you do the videos to
- **[29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1791s)** — kill two birds with one stone, right? So it's for the video.
- **[29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1796s)** — And that's what I've been doing. And then, you know, when I do those videos,
- **[30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1800s)** — oftentimes I'll follow it up the next day with some way to mitigate this. So either going for
- **[30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1807s)** — a walk or taking supplements like berberine or apple cider vinegar, which I did after the
- **[30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1811s)** — donuts. I did that the following day. And that can really help to reduce those blood sugar
- **[30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1816s)** — spikes too. So I'm realistic in the sense that it's very difficult to drop all this highly
- **[30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1821s)** — processed food. Like 80% of the food out there is highly processed. Yeah.
- **[30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1826s)** — 83%. It's difficult to give that up entirely and just switch over to whole foods.
- **[30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1830s)** — That's a tough challenge. So my goal is to bring this down, bring the balance of this,
- **[30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1836s)** — the ratio of highly processed foods to these whole foods. I want to bring that down. If I'm
- **[30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1843s)** — 80% processed foods and 20% whole foods, I want to bring that up to 50%. My goal is to bring
- **[30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1851s)** — that up so I'm eating more whole foods to processed foods. And that can have a tremendous
- **[30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1856s)** — impact alone. But to be conscious of what category the foods I'm eating are in,
- **[31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1862s)** — highly processed versus whole foods, that is a big thing as well too. That's a good habit
- **[31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1868s)** — get into. What am I eating here? Is this processed or is this a whole food? And then being
- **[31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1874s)** — conscious of that, bringing that ratio up. But again, it's really hard to do that entirely
- **[31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1879s)** — just to quit that processed food, sugary food, cold turkey. I can't do that. So
- **[31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1886s)** — to me, it's about making incremental steps towards evening out this ratio of processed
- **[31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1893s)** — to high-level. I think that's one of the advantages of the continuous glucose
- **[31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1897s)** — monitors. Number one, you can really finally face and look inside your body and go,
- **[31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1904s)** — oh my gosh, this is what's happening. Because before you're like, I don't want
- **[31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1908s)** — to think about it. But if it's in your face, you're checking your glucose and you're
- **[31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1911s)** — looking at that. That's motivating. Yes, you feel better, but then you see it and then like,
- **[31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1918s)** — so I mean, and then you also have just the experience of going through this. I think
- **[32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1927s)** — if a person had the basic understanding and they experienced it for at least a week or two,
- **[32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1933s)** — I don't think they're going to ever go back to where they were originally because
- **[32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1938s)** — now they know that they feel so much better. I think this is what the glucose monitors
- **[32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1944s)** — helping with is like making more of a longer change and not ever going back because
- **[32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1950s)** — now you know it's in your knowledge base. It's not just you've experienced it because I
- **[32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1956s)** — would I don't know if you would agree with this. I had to go through some suffering.
- **[32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1963s)** — And then I had to change my diet to really prove to myself, this was correct. I mean,
- **[32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1969s)** — I mean, you don't have to once you feel that way. It's like, there's a point where what am I
- **[32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1974s)** — gonna ever go back now because I know I know I know I don't want to feel that way.
- **[32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1979s)** — That's like me with late night eating carbohydrates that at night I say to myself,
- **[33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1984s)** — do I want to go through an all night spike again for this? Yeah, right. It's not worth
- **[33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1990s)** — it. So one tip that I use is I'll see something that I like. I like popcorn,
- **[33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=1995s)** — for example. I'll just put myself okay, let me just envision myself eating it.
- **[33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2000s)** — Okay, what the pleasure? And then what am I going to feel like about a half hour later,
- **[33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2004s)** — an hour later? Like, now I think I'll pass. But there's a, you know, if we take a look at
- **[33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2011s)** — processed food, I recently started looking at all the processed foods and looking at the
- **[33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2018s)** — common denominator, what really makes it up as far as like ingredients. And there's a lot of
- **[33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2023s)** — complexities in the label. But really, when you come down to it, there's just three things that
- **[33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2027s)** — make up 99% of it. And that would be this right here, which is maybe not in the form of
- **[33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2035s)** — even sugar cane, it's too expensive, they use beet sugar or, or glucose syrup. And then of
- **[34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2041s)** — course, you have seed oils, there's always seed oils. Now, what's interesting about that is
- **[34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2047s)** — people think of saturated fats in junk food? No, they're all unsaturated fat. I mean, you
- **[34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2054s)** — do you ever see any more like lard or Taylor in here? No, it's seed oils. And then you
- **[34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2061s)** — have, of course, modified food storage, modified cornstarch, maltodextrin. So those
- **[34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2068s)** — are that's it. And if you were just to take those three ingredients and mix them up and
- **[34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2072s)** — put some flavoring on there, you wouldn't eat it. It has to be packaged in a really nice
- **[34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2078s)** — thing like this. And it has to be in the right texture. And but I think more education
- **[34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2084s)** — is going to be the key to get people off of it. And then I think I want to close with
- **[34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2090s)** — the continuous glucose monitor. I personally went out to get one. And I think it was that was
- **[34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2097s)** — the free free bird or what was that called? The lifestyle Libre. Yeah, it's the lifestyle Libre.
- **[35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2105s)** — Yeah, I tried that. You know what? I it didn't work. It just had it was actually really bad
- **[35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2111s)** — reviews. And then I, I tried it again. And I tried a third time and it just broke down.
- **[35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2115s)** — And then I'm right now I just got the one that you recommended. So what and I don't
- **[35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2121s)** — even remember what it's called because I just got it in the mail. What Which one do you use?
- **[35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2125s)** — I use the brand at Cygnus. And they, they cater to people that are trying to improve
- **[35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2132s)** — their metabolic health. And I really like them because of the software. The software is very
- **[35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2138s)** — intuitive and easy to use. And once you get the data, how what you do with the data is
- **[35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2143s)** — important. So being able to read that data properly is important. And some of the
- **[35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2153s)** — not as intuitive, not as easy to use. Customer service is an important one as well. If you
- **[35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2158s)** — have any questions, you want to be able to get a quick answer so you can move on and get
- **[36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2164s)** — things going. So that's another issue as well, too. I like this company. I've been
- **[36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2169s)** — working with them for over a year and a half now. And not all of these things run
- **[36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2175s)** — perfectly all the time. There are little hiccups along the way. But of all the ones
- **[36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2178s)** — I've tried, this one seems to be the most stable. And it works very, very well.
- **[36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2184s)** — So yeah, even the reviews are much better. That's important. But also, is it small or too?
- **[36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2191s)** — It's small. Yeah, it's a nice small. So these companies usually use one of two
- **[36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2196s)** — hardware. So the biotech is there's two companies that really do it. One is the
- **[36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2203s)** — lifestyle Libre. And the other one is the Dexcom. And the Dexcom has higher ratings. A
- **[36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2208s)** — lot of people like it more. But it's the service that you get. They have different
- **[36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2214s)** — software, different applications that you have on your phone. And I've tried a lot of
- **[36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2218s)** — different ones. And again, you want ease of use. And you want something with it with an
- **[37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2224s)** — interface that gives you suggestions on what to do. So when I'm eating something and I
- **[37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2229s)** — have a blood sugar spike, it'll notify me. It'll make suggestions for me to lower that
- **[37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2234s)** — like go for a walk. Now's the time to do some exercise. I can log the foods that I eat.
- **[37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2240s)** — And it will tell me, you know, give me suggestions on what to do to manage my blood
- **[37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2245s)** — sugar, which is a really good thing. So you're not just stuck with a bunch of data that you
- **[37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2250s)** — don't really know what to do with. So a lot of the brands out there kind of don't offer
- **[37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2258s)** — as much as what the Signos does. And that's part of the reason I like it so much.
- **[37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2262s)** — I'm excited to use it. I'll be doing some experiments myself and then I will have to
- **[37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2267s)** — do another video. But I will put your link down below also, Cigna. There's a link down
- **[37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znFnEVb-eZ4&t=2272s)** — there as well. And hey, thanks for this collaboration. I think this is a great video
