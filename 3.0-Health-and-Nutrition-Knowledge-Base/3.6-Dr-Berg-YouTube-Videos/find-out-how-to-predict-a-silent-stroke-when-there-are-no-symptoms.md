- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=0s)** — Today let's talk about how to predict a silent stroke. A silent stroke is a stroke that has
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=7s)** — no symptoms. So how could you actually predict it? Is it possible? Well, we're going to use this book
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=13s)** — right here. One of my favorite books. It's called The Technology of War. You probably
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=16s)** — heard of The Art of War by Sun Tzu. But The Technology of War was written by this guy who
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=24s)** — found that there's so many confusions in The Art of War, he decided to learn Mandarin Chinese and
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=30s)** — transcribe the entire original text. And he was curious about if the original text was the same
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=38s)** — as some of these books that are put out there, The Art of War, or slightly different. And in a
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=42s)** — thumbnail he found out that that original text was severely altered to the point of
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=48s)** — a lot of false information, a lot of confusing information, and so it's really difficult to
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=54s)** — make sense out of The Art of War. And even if you look at the original text on the name of
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=58s)** — the book, it wasn't even called The Art of War because art implies more maybe creativity,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=63s)** — but technology is a very specific thing. And so The Technology of War is Sun Tzu's original
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=69s)** — transcript on how he won so many wars. So we're going to apply that to the body. And
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=75s)** — the reason I'm going to do this is because of this word prediction. This book is really into
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=79s)** — predicting things like, number one, if you should go into battle or not. You can predict
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=85s)** — that based on your advantages and things like that. If you only have a 10% chance of winning
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=89s)** — a battle, you better not go to war. You better run in the other direction as fast as you can
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=95s)** — because there's no advantage there. You're going to lose. So he talks a lot about certain
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=99s)** — things or like clues or indicators to know if you're going to be successful or not. So we
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=105s)** — can apply this to the body too, and especially with the area of strokes. So even though you don't
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=110s)** — have this obvious symptom to tell you're going to get a stroke, there are some things that can
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=116s)** — very easily give you information to know if you are going to have a stroke or not. And
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=122s)** — another really good reference or paragraph, which I'm going to paraphrase, has to do with
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=128s)** — being victorious, knowing yourself and knowing your enemy. So if we were to apply this to
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=134s)** — it's very important to understand the nature of a stroke as well as how our body reacts to it
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=139s)** — and how potentially we can avoid it. So what do we know about silent strokes? There are strokes
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=146s)** — that occur without any symptoms at all. You have it, you don't even know you had it. Apparently
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=152s)** — the damage that it creates in the brain doesn't affect vital areas. So you might not even feel
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=160s)** — anything other than maybe a little bit of a lapse in memory, maybe some fatigue, maybe some
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=167s)** — dizziness, maybe even a mood change. And what's interesting about these silent strokes is that
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=173s)** — in one reference I read they occur five times more than the strokes that create all the classic
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=181s)** — symptoms, like half of your body being numb or weak, or having cognitive dysfunction,
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=185s)** — or having slurred speech. But typically if someone has a stroke, whether it's a silent stroke or
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=191s)** — another stroke, they're very likely to get another one. And strokes are basically the fifth
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=197s)** — leading cause of death in the U.S. and the second leading cause of death in the entire world.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=203s)** — So what else do we know about strokes? Well, there's a lot of different aspects to strokes,
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=207s)** — but I'm basically going to talk about the most common situation with strokes. You have these two
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=214s)** — coronary arteries that come up through the neck through here. They supply the brain with blood.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=220s)** — There's some other arteries, but these are the primary ones. And then they kind of merge
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=223s)** — with some other arteries called the medial cerebral arteries. And most of the strokes,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=228s)** — like over 50% of the strokes, occur in one of those main arteries. The most common type
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=234s)** — of strokes that occur in one of these arteries, like 85% of these strokes, is a situation
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=239s)** — where the blood clot originates in one of those arteries in the brain. So if we were to know the
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=246s)** — enemy or know the blood clot, if we take a look at a blood clot, what is a blood clot?
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=252s)** — And is it really an enemy? It's actually just a mechanism of healing some type of bleeding
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=260s)** — situation, maybe some damage in an artery. So it's not really the enemy. Yet a lot of
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=265s)** — doctors treat it like the enemy by giving you a drug to thin it, but they don't really
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=270s)** — look at the true enemy behind the scenes. And that would be what we're going to talk about.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=275s)** — So a blood clot is a kind of an aggregation of platelets, which are things that help stop
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=281s)** — bleeding with a fibrinogen, which is kind of like the glue that binds everything together.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=286s)** — And blood clots occur in response to some injury or damage, usually in an artery. And
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=293s)** — what is the true enemy or the cause, the root cause of a stroke? Well, if you look at that,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=299s)** — you're going to find some interesting things. Number one, high levels of sugar in the blood
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=304s)** — creates a lot of oxidation and creates a lot of damage in the artery. So there's a much
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=309s)** — higher association between diabetics or pre-diabetics or people with insulin resistance
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=315s)** — and getting blood clots. And so sugar directly, too much dietary sugar and too many carbs
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=322s)** — can create this problem. Not to mention it really increases your inflammation as well as something
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=329s)** — called the sympathetic nervous system. That's right, the stress response. And that leads us
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=335s)** — to number two. That would be adrenaline or you can call it epinephrine, the same thing.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=342s)** — So adrenaline comes from stress and adrenaline can directly increase the risk of getting a
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=352s)** — from chronic stress. Chronic stress causes a vasoconstriction, but it also creates
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=359s)** — a lot of inflammation and it creates your body running on glucose. That's right, glucose.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=365s)** — I did another video on this and this is interesting because now this overlaps with
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=369s)** — number one, eating a lot of sugar. But in this case, you're not eating any sugar. The
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=374s)** — sugar that is there is coming from the stress state. So this combination of eating a high
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=379s)** — carb diet with stress is just a deadly combination for so many issues. These things I'm talking
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=385s)** — about are the true enemies that we need to understand and try to reduce as much as
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=390s)** — possible. And we get to chronic stress as many different types of stress. And I think the
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=394s)** — biggest stress is emotional stress, especially losses. Loss of a loved one, loss of a job,
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=399s)** — loss of money, loss of anything can be very, very devastating to your body. And then we also
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=406s)** — have the side effect for medication like HRT, hormonal replacement therapy. That would be the
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=411s)** — exposure to a lot of estrogen. Also birth control pills also increase the risk of
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=415s)** — getting these strokes. And then number four is smoking. Now, how good smoking? You're
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=421s)** — breathing it in with your lungs that cause a stroke. Well, where does that smoke and chemicals
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=427s)** — go? It goes to your lungs and right into your bloodstream that's carried up to the brain.
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=433s)** — And this smoke that ends up in your brain creates a lot of oxidation, free radical damage,
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=438s)** — and a lot of other issues. And then we have number five. This is another thing. It's
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=444s)** — hypertension. Now, this might not be the enemy either, just kind of like the tip of the
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=448s)** — iceberg that there's something else underneath it. But just the fact that you have hypertension
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=452s)** — can cause a different type of a stroke, which is a hemorrhagic, which you're bleeding
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=457s)** — because it blew a blood vessel. But if we take a look at hypertension, and what's interesting
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=462s)** — about hypertension is that 90% of hypertension is classified as essential, or another name for
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=470s)** — essential is primary. And what does that mean? Well, both of those terms describe
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=477s)** — hypertension of an unknown cause. Yet so many people are being treated by high blood pressure.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=482s)** — I mean, it's pretty wild. I think there's probably a great advantage of keeping that cause
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=487s)** — unknown because you can actually make a lot of money on medication. But the point is that if you
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=492s)** — research hypertension and all the different mechanisms, you're pretty much going to end up
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=497s)** — with the real cause being either one of three things. Okay, most commonly. Number one,
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=505s)** — insulin resistance. If you take a look at high sugar diets or high carb diets, it thickens
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=510s)** — the wall of the artery. It makes the artery stiff. Okay, so there's no more elasticity.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=517s)** — So you're going to increase pressure just from that. So again, that crosses over with the
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=521s)** — number one thing, which is the high sugar in the diet. Number two, a potassium deficiency.
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=526s)** — Now, what does potassium have to do with the arteries? Well, potassium keeps the arteries
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=531s)** — elastic. It keeps them flexible. And without potassium, your arteries can become very
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=537s)** — hardened and your blood pressure can go up. There's a lot of data on having enough
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=542s)** — potassium in keeping your blood pressure normalized. And where does potassium come from?
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=547s)** — Well, it comes from a lot of the foods that are high in magnesium too. And that would be
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=551s)** — the leafy greens. The average person consumes only like a cup and a half of vegetables a day
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=557s)** — where they really need about, you know, seven to 10 cups of salad per day or four to five
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=563s)** — cups of regular vegetables. And a lack of potassium also can cause problems with arrhythmias
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=569s)** — like atrial fibrillation, which is another predisposing factor of getting a stroke.
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=575s)** — And then we also have a lack of vitamin D, which a lot of people are deficient in.
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=579s)** — Lack of vitamin D will create more inflammation. It will increase your chance of getting,
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=584s)** — you know, prediabetes and diabetes and insulin resistance. And so I always recommend
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=588s)** — a good amount of vitamin D, potassium, and they get on a low carb diet. That seems to
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=595s)** — handle a lot of hypertension, which will indirectly put you at a much lower risk of getting a stroke.
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=600s)** — So when we talk about predicting a sudden stroke, if someone is eating a lot of carbs,
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=605s)** — okay, and they're diabetic, and they don't eat much salad, and they're going through a lot
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=610s)** — of stress, and they're sedentary, those are the true enemies, the factors that will
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=615s)** — predict a stroke. And one last concept I want to talk about in this book.
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=619s)** — The first part of the book is all about getting intel, intelligence. So you're able to evaluate
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=626s)** — and then predict and have the knowledge before you go to battle. Because if you go to battle,
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=631s)** — or battled with an illness, a sickness, let's say you're battling cancer, for example,
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=636s)** — directly with chemotherapy and everything else, and just throwing everything out the wall to try
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=642s)** — reverse the situation, the outcomes are not that great. If we understand the body, as well as a
- **[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=649s)** — lot of these other conditions, and that is what my YouTube channel is all about. Giving you the
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=653s)** — information so you can estimate things or evaluate things, and you can predict things, and you can
- **[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=658s)** — prevent a lot of health problems down the road. So number one, get on keto and intermittent
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=663s)** — fasting. Number two, make sure you have enough salad in your diet. That way you get the
- **[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=668s)** — potassium and magnesium. Number three, start a regular exercise program to flesh out the
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=674s)** — adrenaline and the stress that builds up, that ends up creating a lot of problems and killing a
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=677s)** — lot of people. And also make sure that you're eating nutrient-dense foods to provide the B
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=682s)** — vitamins. Vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin D, for all the other support for creating a healthy
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=688s)** — body. Now if you haven't seen this very popular video on the best meal to clean out
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIPd0tNnHU&t=692s)** — your arteries, I put it up right here. Check it out.
