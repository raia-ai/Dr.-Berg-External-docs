- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=0s)** — You do not want to get a surgery unless you do this one thing first.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=5s)** — And this is really, really important. There's a lot of risks when you go into a surgery.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=9s)** — One is dying. This video is not just for patients. It's for doctors too.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=13s)** — So they can look at the research and this simple thing, which basically costs pennies,
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=20s)** — can create a massive improvement in your outcomes of the surgery you get.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=24s)** — Getting your vitamin D tested and making sure you have sufficient vitamin D before surgery.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=29s)** — All surgeries. What is so special about vitamin D in relationship to a surgery?
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=34s)** — Doing the surgery itself lowers your vitamin D because there's trauma involved.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=39s)** — If you're deficient in vitamin D, blood pressure can go up.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=43s)** — Vitamin D is one of the best remedies for high blood pressure because vitamin D increases
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=47s)** — something called nitric oxide, which helps vasodilation of the arteries.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=51s)** — Your immune system depends on enough vitamin D to prevent infections like sepsis, inflammation.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=58s)** — Vitamin D is really important to reduce cardiovascular complications after a surgery.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=63s)** — And once steady, before the operation, there was an average of 42.7.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=68s)** — And take a wild guess what the average vitamin D was after the surgery. 28.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=72s)** — In your mind, you might think I might need to take 2,000 IUs.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=76s)** — No. People are taking like 100,000 or even 300,000 or more before surgery.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=83s)** — Then you also have vitamin D affecting your muscles.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=85s)** — If you don't have enough vitamin D to the muscles, the muscles can become weak.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=89s)** — And your risk of falling down greatly goes up.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=92s)** — If you're elderly, this is a problem because you might end up fracturing yourself.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=95s)** — I mean, even if you do a search on Google Scholar and found six studies involving vitamin D
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=100s)** — and surgery for osteoporosis, another 10 studies on bone in general and vitamin D
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=106s)** — in relationship to healing after surgery. If someone has low vitamin D, their post-operative
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=112s)** — inflammatory indicators actually increase by 200%.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=115s)** — And the wound that they just created takes longer to heal.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=118s)** — I'm excited to tell you a little bit about a new product called Natural B12
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=122s)** — Methylcobalamin with the B complex blend.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=125s)** — What's really unique about this product is the B complex vitamins actually come from food,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=131s)** — which is very different from most B vitamins, which come from petroleum.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=135s)** — This B12 is not synthetic. It's the natural version called methylcobalamin.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=140s)** — If you want a really high quality B12, you might want to try this. Take one a day.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=144s)** — I take this in the morning, but some people find it more convenient to take it with a meal.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=147s)** — This one bottle will last you two months, 60 days.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=150s)** — Vitamin D also controls this antimicrobial peptide,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=156s)** — which is a compound to help your immune system kill microbes.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=158s)** — Vitamin D has the potential to increase those antimicrobial peptides by 4,000%,
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=164s)** — keeping the complication of an infection way down.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=166s)** — Surgical complications are cut in half with sufficient vitamin D.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=171s)** — In one study, I found as much as half of atrial fibrillation was reduced with enough vitamin D.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=176s)** — In that study, it actually blew my mind. They were using 600,000 IUs of vitamin D3.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=183s)** — We definitely want to make sure we have enough vitamin D if you're going into an open
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=187s)** — heart surgery, if you're having your thyroid taken out, surgery to remove cancer.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=191s)** — If someone is low in vitamin D, the post-surgical cognitive side effects or dysfunction
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=199s)** — are 8 times more likely to have cognitive dysfunction after a surgery if you don't have
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=203s)** — enough vitamin D. Having enough vitamin D can decrease your risk of having some type of
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=209s)** — rejection when you're doing an organ transplant. In one study, I found there were fewer
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=214s)** — complications, especially in the area of ventilators. When 120,000 IUs of vitamin D
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=221s)** — were used. When you think about vitamin D, think of fewer days in the hospital after the surgery,
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=226s)** — faster healing rates. There was a study involving children in intensive care.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=231s)** — They loaded up these children 10,000 IUs per kilogram. At first, I thought it was a typo.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=237s)** — It should have been 1,000 IUs, but it was actually 10,000 IUs. Some people are going to
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=243s)** — ask, well, what about the toxic effects? We're only talking about using these high doses,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=247s)** — three days before surgery. We're not talking about using the high doses long term. You're not getting
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=253s)** — all that vitamin D to go in there, but you're at least saturating the body with enough
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=257s)** — to make sure that there's no cells that are insufficient. Now, there's also some interesting
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=263s)** — data about your adrenal glands. Because going through a surgery puts a lot of stress
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=267s)** — on your adrenals. This is why they monitor your heart, because sometimes your adrenals
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=272s)** — might overcompensate with adrenaline and you can end up with high blood pressure. So there's
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=276s)** — definitely an adrenal stress surgery connection, giving you a risk of adrenal
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=281s)** — insufficiency. They've even tested a cortisol spike after a surgery. It can increase by 4x
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=287s)** — if you're low in vitamin D, which can worsen your ability to heal your regulation of
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=292s)** — inflammation. Your adrenals do not want to go through a surgery with low vitamin D. Vitamin
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=297s)** — D influences over 2,000 genes, but there's 200 of those genes relate to your adrenals. This
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=304s)** — video is not just to remind you to get your vitamin D tested before surgery, but to make
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=310s)** — sure you have sufficient amounts. And I'm not talking about just a little bit. I'm talking
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=314s)** — about a lot before you go into surgery. You want to take this additional vitamin D three
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=320s)** — days before a surgery. So it has time to really penetrate and get into your cells and
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=325s)** — act as a protective mechanism against the complications of surgery. Thanks for watching.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=331s)** — Spread this video to your friends and families so they can have this knowledge of doing
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=334s)** — something extremely simple and inexpensive to create a lot of good or protect you
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE&t=340s)** — against a lot of bad things that can happen as you go through a surgery.
