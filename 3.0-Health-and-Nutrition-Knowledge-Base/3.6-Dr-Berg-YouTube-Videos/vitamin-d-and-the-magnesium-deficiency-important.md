- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=0s)** — Today I want to talk about vitamin D and a magnesium deficiency.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=3s)** — There's a very interesting relationship between vitamin D and magnesium
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=7s)** — that I think you should know about. Especially since most of the population
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=10s)** — is deficient in both vitamin D and magnesium.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=13s)** — I think it's 75% of the population has low vitamin D levels
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=17s)** — and 45% has low magnesium levels.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=22s)** — And here's what you need to know. All of the enzymes
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=24s)** — involving the conversion of vitamin D
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=28s)** — to the active form of vitamin D
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=31s)** — are magnesium dependent. That means if you're completely
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=35s)** — zero with magnesium, vitamin D will not work. Period.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=40s)** — And we know how important vitamin D is for bone, for bone pain,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=45s)** — for insulin resistance, for your immune system
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=48s)** — to prevent muscle cramps, cardiovascular problems
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=52s)** — with blood pressure and fatigue. So magnesium allows vitamin D
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=56s)** — to work. And vitamin D also allows magnesium to be absorbed
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=63s)** — by a factor of 30%. So they're both synergistically helping each other.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=68s)** — Now there's another mineral involved and it's calcium.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=71s)** — If you're low in magnesium, you're going to have problems with that calcium because
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=75s)** — not only does vitamin D help the absorption of calcium by 20%
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=80s)** — in your gut, but magnesium also helps regulate calcium.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=84s)** — Magnesium helps prevent calcium from building up
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=87s)** — inside your arteries. Magnesium is really good for blood pressure
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=91s)** — and just having elastic arteries to adapt to exercise
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=94s)** — and bounce back from stress. Things like that. And it helps lower cortisol
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=98s)** — and it will help you sleep. So there's a certain ratio of calcium to
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=102s)** — magnesium that someone needs. And roughly you need like twice as
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=105s)** — much calcium as magnesium. But nowadays this ratio is really like
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=109s)** — three times as much calcium as magnesium.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=112s)** — And the simple solution is to increase your magnesium.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=117s)** — But the problem is how do you do that? Because the average person only
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=120s)** — consumes like one and a half cups of salad per day. It's not even
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=124s)** — probably the dark leafy greens that's high in magnesium. And also
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=128s)** — like I think it's 83% of all the calories in the grocery store
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=132s)** — are ultra processed. And that's another way that people are deficient in
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=137s)** — magnesium because our foods are just stripped of all the magnesium.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=140s)** — And when we have this increase in calcium to a magnesium then we
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=146s)** — start getting, you know, calcification of the arteries. It even
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=150s)** — can increase the risk of different types of cancer. Prostate, colorectal.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=156s)** — It can increase polyps which potentially could end up going into a
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=161s)** — cancer state. So I just wanted to put this on your radar to make
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=164s)** — sure you're having enough of magnesium to allow vitamin D to work.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=169s)** — But also don't forget about vitamin D. You need that as well. Now because of
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=173s)** — the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube, it's
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=177s)** — becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's a lot of content
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGinb8VWxc&t=181s)** — that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately. So to make sure you
