- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the real benefit of chia seeds. I mean, if we talk about the omega-3s, okay,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=6s)** — omega-3s are good for the heart, they're good for thinning the blood, and of course, salmon and
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=11s)** — sardines are always recommended because they have high amounts of omega-3. Then what's this deal
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=17s)** — with chia seeds having more omega-3 if you look gram for gram? But what they don't tell you
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=24s)** — is the type of omega-3 is not the active omega-3 that people think about as an anti-inflammatory.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=30s)** — That's called DHA. The type of omega-3 that chia is known for, and by the way,
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=35s)** — chia has the most of this, is called ALA. It's the thing that comes before the conversion
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=42s)** — into this active form of this omega-3. So the question is how much of that ALA converts to DHA?
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=50s)** — And the answer is not very much. It's like 0.5%. The next point is about eggs. Now,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=58s)** — whereas an egg, like a medium-sized egg might have seven grams of protein, chia seed has
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=64s)** — four grams of protein. The question is, is it the same? And the answer is no, because the egg
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=71s)** — is the most bioavailable protein that you can consume. Actually, I lied. Breast
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=80s)** — but chia seed and other plant proteins are pretty low on the list, and I've searched everywhere for
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=86s)** — a long period of time to try to find out how bioavailable it is, and I couldn't find that data.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=91s)** — Now, chia seed also has some vitamin E, some vitamin C. It has some of the B vitamins. It
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=98s)** — has calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium. And if you look at the research on chia seed,
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=103s)** — you'll see cardio-protective benefits, benefits to help lower your blood pressure,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=109s)** — benefits for your brain, and can even thin your blood. But the biggest benefit from consuming chia
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=115s)** — seeds has to do with this soluble fiber. Okay, so, and what I normally do is take two
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=122s)** — tablespoons of chia seed and I'll put it in about a half a cup of either milk or almond
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=129s)** — milk, okay, unsweetened. And then I'll kind of mix it around until it swells up into this
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=135s)** — and then I'll add some berries or some kefir, which is a little better than yogurt.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=141s)** — But if you're going to use yogurt, I would use Greek yogurt, some coconut cream, and maybe some
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=147s)** — nuts, and it makes a great pudding. Okay, but the benefit is in this gel. This gel is a
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=154s)** — soluble fiber that is a wonderful food for your microbiome. Your microbiome love this gel,
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=163s)** — and they can eat it up and turn it into food for the colon cells. And they can use it as energy.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=171s)** — If you have inflammation in your gut, this would be a good thing to take.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=175s)** — And also if you have constipation, it can help you with that as well. Some people are
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=179s)** — concerned about these things called lactins, which can actually irritate the colon if there's
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=184s)** — inflammation. Well, chia seeds have very low amounts of lactins, so you don't have to worry
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=189s)** — lactins with chia seed. Also in that gel, you have other nutrients like polyphenols. These are
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=195s)** — certain plant-based chemicals that your microbes love and they can eat as well. But the real
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=200s)** — benefit is feeding microbes that benefit you indirectly. There's a huge connection between
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=206s)** — your mood and your energy and how your overall health is and the health of the gut microbiome.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=213s)** — So I would recommend consuming things like chia seed and other things that can feed the
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=218s)** — microbes, including fermented vegetables like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi, things like that,
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=224s)** — on a regular basis. A couple little last points. You don't want to grind the seeds.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=229s)** — You can soak them whole. The Aztecs used to consume chia seeds. So it's been around for
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=235s)** — a long time. Now if you have not seen my other video on chia seeds, check it out. I put
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqTnjBM0Y&t=239s)** — it up right here.
