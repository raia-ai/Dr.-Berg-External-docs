- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=0s)** — You know, boy, my viewpoint in intermittent fasting has gone from all the way over here to all the way over here.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=7s)** — At one time, when someone mentioned fasting, I'm like, what is that going to do?
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=11s)** — Fasting? It's not going to help you. And then when I started looking into it,
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=16s)** — I'm like, wow, fasting is the most important thing you can do for your health out of all the things.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=22s)** — And I want to talk about why that is. I mean, if you look at fasting from a scale of
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=26s)** — what can a person do to create more health, it's right at the top of the list.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=31s)** — It's more important in what you eat. It's more important than exercise.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=35s)** — I mean, when you think about the survival mechanism in our bodies, right, we have developed
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=40s)** — some serious biochemistry relating to preventing dying from starvation, preventing being frozen
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=49s)** — to death, also preventing being eaten by lions by running away. So we have this fasting, we
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=55s)** — have cold therapy, we have exercise that tends to mimic how our bodies develop these survival
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=62s)** — mechanisms. So when you do fasting, you directly trigger all these amazing survival genes.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=70s)** — And this involves pretty much every part of your body. Every part of your body starts to
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=74s)** — improve. I mean, if you compare the environment that we used to be in, which is
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=78s)** — not frequent eating, to the environment now, which is grazing all day long, you can see the
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=85s)** — I mean, today is the day after Christmas, okay. Now yesterday there was food available
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=91s)** — all day long. And it wasn't unhealthy food, but it was just a lot of food. And I grazed pretty
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=97s)** — much all day long. And I can tell you, I don't feel very good. I don't feel good when I eat
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=103s)** — in a constant way. So when you start fasting, you know, the first thing you do is you give up
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=108s)** — your snacks. And then the second thing you do is you tend to let that breakfast go away.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=111s)** — You go as long as you can until you can get to that first meal, which is roughly maybe at lunch
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=116s)** — time. And then you wait until dinner, and then you eat, and then you don't snack. And yes,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=120s)** — you can have coffee, you can have tea, you can drink liquids. Just make sure it's not
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=124s)** — like juice or sodas or anything sweet or anything of any calories. Now typically,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=130s)** — everyone fasts when they're sleeping, right? Why would you want to mess up the whole fasting
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=134s)** — by eating breakfast? Many people are not hungry in the morning. Unless they eat a little
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=140s)** — something, and then they'll be hungry an hour and a half. So eating does cause you to be hungry.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=146s)** — But if you don't give into that and you start fasting, you start to repair your pancreas.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=152s)** — The pancreas has taken a beating from all this frequent eating, all the carbohydrates.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=157s)** — So the little cells that regulate insulin, called the beta cells, are really the cell that
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=163s)** — gets hammered the most when we eat a lot of carbs and we eat very frequently. And so
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=168s)** — it's pumping out all this insulin all the time. And rarely does anyone actually test the insulin.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=174s)** — They look at the blood sugar. And basically 10 to 20, 30 years, your blood sugar could be
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=179s)** — normal. But in the background, you have this massive insulin spike. But you don't really test
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=184s)** — that. Over time, your body starts developing something called insulin resistance. Insulin
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=191s)** — resistance is a situation where the receptors are going to protect you against this excess
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=197s)** — amount of insulin and carbohydrate. It's a protective survival mechanism. So even though
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=202s)** — you're eating a lot of carbs, everything looks normal unless you check this insulin situation.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=206s)** — And then over time, when this pancreas gets exhausted, it can no longer compensate. So your
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=213s)** — insulin production starts going down. And insulin keeps the blood sugar lower. So now we
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=219s)** — don't have that control. So now the blood sugar has no choice but to start going up.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=223s)** — So we start getting prediabetes and then diabetes, which is a high level of sugar in the blood because
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=228s)** — we now have so much insulin resistance and your beta cells in the pancreas are so tired, they
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=233s)** — just can't work anymore. Well guess what? Fasting starts to repair and protect the beta
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=240s)** — cell. The beta cell starts to heal and insulin starts to become more sensitive. So you have
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=246s)** — less insulin resistance, which is going to help everything. So because you're not eating
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=252s)** — so darn frequently, your digestive system finally has a chance to relax in between eating. I mean,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=260s)** — most people are eating so frequently. Just think about how much work that digestive system has
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=265s)** — to work. But when you do intermittent fasting, finally the system has a chance to not work so
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=270s)** — hard. You will also have an antidepressant effect. Your mood is going to be elevated. So
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=279s)** — 18-hour window of fasting. So the first meal might be at 12. The second meal might be at 6.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=286s)** — There's also a large amount of people who also go to one meal a day. Now this is not
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=292s)** — necessarily just to focus on reducing calories, but it is very difficult to consume the same
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=297s)** — calories from three meals to one meal. What you're actually doing too is you're not
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=302s)** — slowing your metabolism. You are correcting a slowed metabolism, which really at the heart of
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=308s)** — is insulin resistance. Okay, so now that you're at one meal a day, what's going to happen next is
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=314s)** — your inflammation is going to go way down. All of these inflammatory conditions start to
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=319s)** — be improved. Your body actually makes antioxidants. It's called endogenous from within
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=327s)** — a production of antioxidants. So when you fast, your body starts making more antioxidants
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=334s)** — to help counter the oxidative stress. You see, if you think about oxidative stress,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=339s)** — all the things that, you know, from radiation to pollution, junk foods, it all produces a lot
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=344s)** — of free radical damage. Well, if you have enough antioxidants, you can counter that.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=349s)** — And the microbes in your digestion, which has a huge influence over your immune system,
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=355s)** — start to thrive. And you get more microbes. So your microbes do better when you don't feed
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=362s)** — And having this diversified microbiome, you get all sorts of improvements, definitely in the
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=367s)** — cognitive function. There's something called brain derived neurotrophic factor. That would be
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=373s)** — like miracle grow for your brain. Now, and then a lot of people add prolonged fasting,
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=378s)** — okay, here and there. And that produces even bigger benefits. In prolonged fasting, like,
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=384s)** — let's say you fast for two days, you're going to strengthen autophagy. Autophagy is the
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=390s)** — recycling of old damaged proteins, viruses, pathogens in your cell. Your body cleans those up
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=397s)** — and recycles them into healthy tissue, which is pretty wild. And even in the guts of your
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=403s)** — cells, you have these mitochondria, which is the key for energy production for so many
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=410s)** — things that are related to disease. You can actually start to repair and clean out the
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=415s)** — damaged mitochondria, which also can trigger cancer, and get rid of those and build new
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=421s)** — mitochondria. So the term for that is called mitochondrial biogenesis. And then some people
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=426s)** — fast longer for like 72 hours. And when you start doing that, you really start to strengthen
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=433s)** — this stimulation of stem cells, especially for your immune system. So a lot of people do
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=440s)** — prolonged fasting to get rid of cancer. In fact, it is one of the best things you can do.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=444s)** — So in this video, I just wanted to touch on the real reason why you should be doing fasting,
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=448s)** — and the amazing benefits. There's a lot of details on how to do it.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oql3QUD2JyI&t=453s)** — For that information, you should watch this video right here.
