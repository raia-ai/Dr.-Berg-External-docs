- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=41s)** — Did you realize that there's more pressure on your disc when you're sitting than when you're standing? And I'm so guilty of that. I sit in this chair, I mean a tremendous amount of time through the day.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=51s)** — And then let's talk about posture, right? So every inch, your head goes forward, past the midline through here, you're adding about 10 pounds of weight in your upper shoulders. So you're sitting forward this way.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=63s)** — You know, and this is what people do, creates a lot of stress, not just on the upper back, on the lower back too. And then what about when you're driving, right? You're reversing the lower back curve and you're sitting there and you're driving long distances.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=73s)** — And then you get home and you sit on the couch, right? Terrible for your back. Add age to this, we actually get shorter. What's happening over time, all this decrease in space is eventually going to hit some of these nerves and you're going to end up with some back pain.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=87s)** — This therapy I'm going to talk about will quickly give you enough space in your back to give you so much relief. And I think this is the absolute hands down best treatment for the lower back because it has virtually no side effects.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=99s)** — What does this treatment involve? It's anti-gravity. Do we have to go to space to get it? Not necessarily. The therapy is using the inversion table to bring yourself gradually almost upside down. And this reverses the flow of gravity.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=115s)** — I'm also going to show you how to do this without an inversion table so you don't need anything at all. You just need a wall. But if you think about it, an inversion table only costs literally $100, maybe up to $400 at the very, very top, which is pretty close to like one treatment going to either the physical therapist, the doctor, the chiropractor.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=133s)** — You can literally buy an inversion table and use it for a very long period of time and do it yourself. Gravity has been putting pressure on us since we were born. So what happens when we reverse this? Reverse the flow. You're using your weight of your upper body to pull down on your lower back, creating this negative pressure allowing all this blood flow.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=154s)** — You're also breaking up adhesions and scar tissue. You want to do intermittent inversion traction where you do it for one to two minutes and then you bring yourself back up and you bring it back to one or two minutes. Bring yourself back up and you're going to do that repetitively. And I'm going to give you kind of a pattern to follow. And I'm going to type that also down in the description. It's one of the most dynamic and effective things you can do to your lower back. You're hitting these key areas. The nerve, the disc, the scar tissue, the lack of blood flow,
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=184s)** — all in one treatment. Like I said before, all we have to do is increase the space by the width of two pieces of paper. There's very powerful research out there that shows that it actually even increases your flexibility, reduces the risk of getting surgery for sciatica, and just gets rid of your lower back pain pretty quick. In some studies it shows that it beats taking medication by 35%. Injections of cortisone shots into your back without the side effects. I do want to mention something really quick. If you have high blood pressure, if you have glaucoma, which
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=214s)** — is higher pressure in your eye, or some other type of heart problems, check with your doctor before doing this. Overall it's relatively pretty safe. It's actually good for the entire body. Here's how you want to start it. You only want to start like one to two minutes. Not reversing yourself completely upside down. Only by an angle of like 15 to 30%. Nothing too crazy. Just a little bit for one to two minutes. Once or maybe twice a day. For about a week. Then slowly increase it to five minutes at about 60 degrees.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=244s)** — For another one to two weeks. We're talking about five minutes or longer. I'm talking about doing it intermittently. You might want to do it for like a minute. Come down, bring yourself up. So there's little pauses in between this. That will create the pumping blood flow in the lower back. But after about three to four weeks, you can do what I do, which I bring myself all the way almost completely upside down. And I'll do that for two minutes. Okay. And then another two minutes. Then I will go back and forth with that cycle for about a week.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=274s)** — For about 15 to 20 minutes. Three times a week. When you do this, you're going to feel taller. You're going to have a lot less pain. And it's going to feel like you just got an amazing stretch. Before I get into the other versions of the inversion technique, I want to explain other things you should be doing to decrease your pain in your lower back and your sciatica. Number one is go on a low carb ketogenic diet. Why? Because that is going to severely reduce your inflammation to the entire body. Number two, start taking a good amount of
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=304s)** — vitamin D. I'm talking about at least 20 to 30,000 international units of vitamin D3 with K2. And with magnesium, it's 400 milligrams of magnesium glycinate. But the reason why you want the vitamin D as the primary thing is because the first place for vitamin D deficiencies to show up is your lower back. The next thing is to eliminate all the omega-6 seed oils out of your diet. The problem with omega-6 is it competes with omega-3,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=333s)** — which is anti-inflammatory. If you're doing all these seed oils, what's going to happen is you're going to start to have overall higher amounts of inflammation. The other thing that I would recommend, myofascial stretching. When you're doing low back stretches, for example, like side bending type stretches, you're not really stretching the fascia. What you want to do is do side bending stretches and lift your arm over your head and stretch down the opposite way. This is why myofascial stretching using the whole body is so
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=363s)** — effective. It's kind of like if you took a rag and it was wet and you rotated it to wring the water out and then you bent it to the side. That's when you get all the water out. That's exactly what you want to do. Let's say you don't have an immersion table. Just get a couple blankets and your pillow and you can roll them up as you see in this video right here. This is called yoga's child pose. And you're literally creating a situation where there's very little pressure on your lower back and you're laying over it and you're
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=393s)** — creating space in your lower back. It's going to give you a lot of relief. Why? Because you eliminated gravity. It's probably not going to create a major decompression, but it's going to give you a lot of relief. Next stretch is called the wall assisted leg up stretch. You can do one leg at a time. You're literally lifting up your pelvis. You can just hold it up there or you can go back and forth to strengthen it. You're basically using the wall to create a little bit of an inversion with your lower back. The
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=423s)** — next one, you'll need a kind of an exercise ball. And this is called the lying spinal decompression with a stability ball. You're literally going to just lay over this ball and the ball is going to be pressing upward as you're laying over it, creating this distraction because you're allowing your gravity for your upper body and your lower body to go over your lower back. The last anti gravity technique is in the water because when you go in the water, there's less gravity and you can float around. It'll gradually decompress the lower back.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rKCJlsnAM8&t=453s)** — Not to the degree that these other things will or the inversion table, but it can greatly help you. If you have sciatica nerve pain or lower back pain, your next most important thing to do, it's a drink for joint pain and it's super effective. This is how you make it. Just click right here.
