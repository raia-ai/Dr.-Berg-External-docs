- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=0s)** — There is one very important nutrient that prevents a lot of health problems.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=5s)** — Vitamin K2. If you have calcium in your arteries, Vitamin K2's job is to remove it.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=11s)** — But you have other soft tissues as well. So this is the hip joint. Vitamin K2 tells the joints
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=16s)** — to release the soft tissue, whether it's arthritis, calcium deposits. It tells it to be released
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=23s)** — into the blood. The other function of Vitamin K2 is to make sure calcium goes from that blood
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=28s)** — into the bone. And it binds very tightly to your bones and your teeth. So when you don't have enough
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=35s)** — of this Vitamin K2, you get a lot of soft tissue calcification. And you also get a lot of bone
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=40s)** — corrosion like osteoporosis as well as cavities. And the reason why we have Vitamin K2 is
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=46s)** — because it's very, very dangerous to have too much calcium in the soft tissues. We're supposed
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=51s)** — to have it directed into the bone and your teeth, but it's not normal to have it in
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=55s)** — So our body has this whole mechanism of keeping it in the right place. And so the question is,
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=61s)** — where does Vitamin K2 come from? It can either come from our foods or it can be
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=66s)** — converted by certain microbes in our gut from another vitamin called Vitamin K1. And Vitamin
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=71s)** — K1 comes from leafy greens. And so of course, if you're not eating a lot of leafy greens,
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=75s)** — you're probably not getting enough K1. So the next question is, what type of foods are very
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=80s)** — Vitamin K2? One is called natto. That's fermented soybeans. This is something they consume in
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=87s)** — Japan, maybe areas of China. Natto has the most Vitamin K2. A lot of people take it if they
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=92s)** — have a heart problem and they're at risk for a stroke. And what's interesting is that here we
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=97s)** — have this natto. It's very high in K2, but it also seems to counter the effects of Vitamin
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=103s)** — K1. The next highest food with Vitamin K2 is goose liver. It's also high in chicken liver,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=109s)** — beef liver. I cannot consume liver. I do have cod liver, but other types of liver I can't consume
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=115s)** — because I just don't like it. Next food it's in, eel. When's the last time you had some eel?
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=121s)** — Probably never. So those are the foods that have the most Vitamin K2. Okay, there's a lot
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=126s)** — of other ones I'm going to get to. But what's interesting about this is that a lot of people
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=130s)** — are deficient in Vitamin K2 because they don't eat certain foods that are high in K2. However,
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=137s)** — you may have eaten these foods which do have some Vitamin K2. Butter, cheese, primarily from
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=143s)** — grass-fed animals, salami. There's a small amount in pork chops, and there's also some
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=148s)** — in fermented vegetables as in raw sauerkraut. Now what's really ironic is that here we have
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=153s)** — this vitamin that has the potential to keep our arteries completely clean of calcium. Yet
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=158s)** — it's in the fatty foods, which we've been told to stay away from. So it's really ironic
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=163s)** — we're told not to consume the very food that has the antidote to a really big problem that
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=169s)** — people have. Also as a side note, Vitamin K2 is a fat soluble vitamin. If you don't have a
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=174s)** — gallbladder, if you have a bad liver, you might not have the bile to help you absorb
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=179s)** — Vitamin K2. Now, I mentioned another way to get Vitamin K2 from K1, but only if you have
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=186s)** — the microbes that are needed to make that conversion. There's a microbe called B. subtilis.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=191s)** — This is the main microbe that helps you convert K1 to K2. Unfortunately, this microbe is very
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=198s)** — easily destroyed when you consume broad spectrum antibiotics. Only like 30% of the population
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=205s)** — have this microbe in their gut. And so if you don't have the microbe and you're not eating
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=209s)** — the foods with Vitamin K2, you're more at risk for developing this calcification in your
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=214s)** — soft tissues. But you need to know there are certain things that really destroy the gut's
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=220s)** — to make Vitamin K2. That's antibiotics, steroids, as in prednisone, PPIs or antacids,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=229s)** — consuming GMO foods because the glyphosate acts as an antibiotic, alcohol, junk food, eating a
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=236s)** — lot of sugar, blood thinners, liver disease, and also being on a low-fat diet. As I said
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=242s)** — before, Vitamin K2 is in fatty foods. Now, one of the toxic effects of way, way too much
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=248s)** — Vitamin D is too much calcium in the arteries. The toxicity effect from Vitamin D causing too
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=255s)** — much calcium in the blood is so rare, you'd have to take hundreds of thousands of Vitamin D3
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=261s)** — for months for that to occur. But guess what? Vitamin K2 can come to the rescue and help
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=267s)** — keep that calcium on the low side. Vitamin K2 is dependent on another nutrient. And this
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=276s)** — won't work. So think about this. If you have kidney stones or arthritis or you have calcium
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=285s)** — in your arteries and you're even taking Vitamin K2, but it's not working, it could be you're
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=290s)** — just low in magnesium. And a lot of people are low in magnesium. And it's very difficult
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=295s)** — to test for it because most of the magnesium is inside the cell, not inside your blood. Only
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=300s)** — 1% is in your blood. So unless you do a biopsy or some sophisticated test, you're not
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=304s)** — going to be able to determine your true levels. So when we're talking about calcium being in
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=309s)** — the wrong place, whether it's in the soft tissue or wherever, magnesium and Vitamin K2 together
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=315s)** — are a great combo solution to solve those problems. If you're taking Vitamin K2,
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=320s)** — you have to realize there's two different kinds. There's the form that's called the MK4.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=325s)** — And then you also have MK7. It's natural, whereas the MK4 is made synthetically. I usually
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=331s)** — recommend using the MK7 version. I would also recommend taking 100 micrograms for every 10,000
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=340s)** — I use of Vitamin D3. That would be the ratio. So if you're doing 20,000 I use of Vitamin D3,
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=346s)** — you would take 200 micrograms of Vitamin K2, the MK7 form. So I really wanted to put this
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=352s)** — Vitamin K2 on your radar, in your awareness, so you can make sure that you consume the foods
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=359s)** — high in Vitamin K2. And because Vitamin K2 is usually associated with Vitamin D,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89jJ1JlNZlg&t=363s)** — if you haven't seen this video, you should check it out. I put it up right here.
