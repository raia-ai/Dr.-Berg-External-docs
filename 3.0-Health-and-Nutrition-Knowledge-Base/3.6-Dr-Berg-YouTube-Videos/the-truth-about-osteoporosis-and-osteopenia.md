- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=0s)** — Now, there's no way you can build up your bones, okay, if you have osteoporosis, with calcium.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=7s)** — It's not going to happen. What's going to happen if you attempt to do that is you're going to get
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=12s)** — calcification of your arteries. So in this video, I'm going to show you
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=18s)** — some insights on osteoporosis as well as osteopenia. What is osteoporosis? Osteoporosis
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=25s)** — is a loss of bone density and bone mass. And so the problem with that is you're at risk for a
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=32s)** — fracture. Now, the purpose of bone is to give you structure, to have a place where ligaments can
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=39s)** — attach, and it's also a reserve for minerals. So if you need more calcium or phosphorus,
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=48s)** — bone is that reserve. And so many people just focus on the calcium aspect of bone, but
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=54s)** — phosphorus, like 85% of phosphorus is stored in your bone, yet we ignore phosphorus. And the
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=60s)** — thing you need to know about phosphorus is that you can have problems with your bone if you have
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=65s)** — too little phosphorus or too much. Because if you have too much phosphorus, as in if you
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=70s)** — drink a lot of sodas or things with phosphoric acid or junk foods, that can cause
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=76s)** — bone loss as well. But just so you know, phosphorus is in a lot of foods. It's in meats,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=81s)** — fish, eggs, it's even in dairy, it's in vegetables. So most people have enough phosphorus unless
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=87s)** — they're doing things to deplete phosphorus, like I said, consuming junk foods or drinking the sodas,
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=92s)** — or they have a kidney problem or they're taking certain medications that are interfering with
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=97s)** — phosphorus. Osteoporosis is severe bone loss, putting you at risk for fractures. Osteopenia
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=104s)** — is kind of a subclinical or a stage that comes before osteoporosis. And what's interesting about
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=111s)** — osteopenia is over 50% of women over the age of 50 have some degree of osteopenia. And a significant
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=119s)** — amount of men have it as well. But osteopenia doesn't really put you at risk for fractures.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=124s)** — It's just a good indicator that you're going down a road that you could end up with
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=128s)** — osteoporosis. But typically a lot of people are told, here take these medications,
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=133s)** — exercise, maybe you should start chewing those chocolate calcium bone building things, which are
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=141s)** — just a joke. But there's a paradox involved with calcification. What they found with this
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=146s)** — paradox is that people that have osteoporosis have a much higher degree of calcification in
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=153s)** — the arteries and the joints. So that's kind of weird that you're having all this excess
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=157s)** — calcium, but it's not going in the right place. The other point I want to bring up
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=161s)** — bone is that in the bone marrow you have an entire factory that is making blood, red blood
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=167s)** — cells, white blood cells, and platelets. So bone is composed of not just calcium, a lot of
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=176s)** — minerals. Also 35% of bone is protein, mostly in the form of collagen. So let's go through
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=184s)** — the key nutrients that are needed to either reverse osteopenia and osteoporosis. And even
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=191s)** — other thing called osteomalacia. Let me just tell you what that is. Osteomalacia is kind of
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=197s)** — soft bones in adults, and that is primarily from a vitamin D deficiency. When this occurs in
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=204s)** — children, we call that rickets. When we're dealing with osteoporosis or osteopenia, we're
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=208s)** — not just looking at a loss of calcium. We're looking at a vitamin K2 deficiency, a vitamin D3
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=215s)** — deficiency usually, which works with K2 together. So let's just start out with vitamin K2. Vitamin
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=222s)** — K2 is a fairly recently discovered vitamin. It's a fat soluble vitamin. It comes from fatty
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=229s)** — foods. It also can come from fermented foods. In Asia, they have something called Neda,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=236s)** — which is fermented soybeans, and that is very high in vitamin K2. Vitamin K2 is also a raw
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=242s)** — sour crowd, but mainly it's in like a fatty sausage. It's in fatty cheese. It's even in
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=249s)** — egg yolks. It's in liver. And so what you need to know about that is that if you're on a low
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=254s)** — fat diet or you're taking certain medications that block vitamin K2 like statins, if you're
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=262s)** — on a blood thinner, or even antidepressants and acids, certain medications for high blood
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=266s)** — pressure, or even medications for erectile dysfunction, you're not going to get enough
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=272s)** — vitamin K2. So vitamin K2 is a really, really important, if not the most important
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=277s)** — vitamin for making your bones really, really solid and hard. But you also need vitamin D3
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=283s)** — with it. And vitamin D3 helps the absorption of calcium by a factor of 20x in the small
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=289s)** — intestine. And so vitamin D helps absorb calcium into the blood from the digestive system. And
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=296s)** — and drives it into the bone. So it's really important to understand what K2 does and to
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=302s)** — make sure either you get it in your diet or you're taking it as a supplement. If you're
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=306s)** — taking it as a supplement, I recommend the form that's called MK7, okay, versus other forms
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=313s)** — like MK4. MK7 is a natural form and it lasts about 48 times longer in your body versus
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=322s)** — the half life of MK4 with about 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3. Now another key vitamin for bone
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=330s)** — is vitamin A. Vitamin A. And I'm not talking about the precursor beta carotene. Retinol,
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=335s)** — which is the bioavailable true form of vitamin A, is really high in egg yolks. This is why
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=342s)** — eggs are just so important in many different ways in your diet, but especially to get
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=347s)** — enough vitamin A. Vitamin A is not just going to help you build bone, but it's also
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=350s)** — going to prevent some of the toxicities that potentially could occur from vitamin D, even
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=356s)** — though those would be very rare. I don't recommend getting your vitamin A from a
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=360s)** — supplement. Just get it from your food. Egg yolks, liver, or other organ meats. Vitamin
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=365s)** — A is in cheese, also in butter, and cow liver oil as well. And so vitamin D3, K2,
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=372s)** — and A are all fat soluble vitamins. So another thing to look out for or understand
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=378s)** — is that you need a good gallbladder and a good liver to produce the bile to absorb these
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=385s)** — nutrients. So if you had your gallbladder out or you have some type of problem with your liver,
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=390s)** — as in fatty liver, these reasons could be why you're not getting these nutrients. In
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=396s)** — which case you should probably just take some bile salts to help with the absorption. So we
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=400s)** — have to make sure that we're getting these nutrients from the diet. We have to make sure
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=404s)** — that nothing's countering those vitamins. We have to make sure we absorb them with the
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=409s)** — right things, like the bile salts. But we also have other things that help build your bone,
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=414s)** — like minerals. Yes, I would be taking some form of calcium if I had osteoporosis or
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=419s)** — osteopenia, but not as a standalone. I would make sure we would take all these other things
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=424s)** — as well. But I would not take the form of calcium that is not very bioavailable. That's
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=430s)** — calcium carbonate. And so many people are taking this type. Basically, it's like limestone.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=435s)** — You'd be better off chewing on the cement outside your house because that's really what it
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=441s)** — is. It's just the form of calcium that has to go through like 12 different biochemical steps
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=447s)** — before it gets absorbed in your body. And if you're getting older, you may find that you
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=453s)** — don't have enough stomach acid to absorb this calcium. So that's another barrier. If
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=458s)** — you don't have the acid in the stomach, you're not going to be able to absorb the calcium,
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=463s)** — magnesium, phosphorus, and the trace minerals that I'm going to talk about next. And so the
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=467s)** — way you would know that you wouldn't have enough stomach acid is usually you have indigestion,
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=471s)** — bloating, or acid reflux. So the type of calcium I would take is like a calcium magnesium
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=477s)** — supplement. But try to get your calcium mostly from food. Dairy, sardines, deep leafy green
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=486s)** — vegetables all have a good amount of calcium and magnesium. And magnesium helps activate vitamin D.
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=495s)** — Also potassium is really important too. So you can get your magnesium and potassium from
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=501s)** — leafy greens like large salads. Now as far as the trace minerals, zinc, copper, and boron
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=509s)** — are the top trace minerals, but there's other ones too. So if you were to take like a
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=513s)** — trace mineral complex, that would be the best thing with emphasis with the zinc, boron,
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=520s)** — and the copper. These can activate certain proteins in bone. So those are really,
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=528s)** — really important as well. And boron helps you balance out the calcium and magnesium. It just
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=535s)** — helps you absorb those two minerals, as well as the activators of the proteins that help you
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=543s)** — make sure you have the best bioavailable type of protein. And that would be animal proteins.
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=549s)** — Eggs are the top protein. And then you have fish. Shellfish would be really, really important.
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=556s)** — Oysters, clams, shrimp are really good because that will not only give you high quality
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=562s)** — protein, but the trace minerals as well. But you might be saying, well, what about all the
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=566s)** — cholesterol? Well, guess what? Biles salts are made out of cholesterol. And you need cholesterol
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=571s)** — to make bile salts to help you absorb these fat soluble nutrients. And you also need cholesterol
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=577s)** — to help build hormones, sex hormones, specifically estrogen. It's not very surprising
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=585s)** — that many women after menopause end up with their bones becoming osteoporotic. And that has
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=592s)** — to do with this sudden drop or shift in this estrogen dropping down. So how do you build that
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=598s)** — up? Well, make sure you have all the precursors to making these hormones. And that would be
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=603s)** — like cholesterol. So as you approach menopause, you want to increase more cholesterol. Okay. And
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=609s)** — cholesterol does not come from plant foods. It comes from animal foods, eggs, butter,
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=616s)** — meats, things like that. And if you complement those foods with a large salad or vegetables
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=623s)** — each day, it can really help you regulate and moderate the amount of cholesterol going
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=627s)** — through the body. Not that you're concerned with that or not, but I think the balance of both of
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=633s)** — those types of foods, plant-based and animal-based are really important. Exercise would be an
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=639s)** — important thing to add into this program to stimulate the bone growth, which will also
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=647s)** — indirectly reduce stress because cortisol is very destructive on your bones. So if you're
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=657s)** — on top of the menopause situation where the adrenals have to back up your ovaries,
- **[11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=662s)** — that could be a big trigger for osteopenia or then osteoporosis. The other thing you need to
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=667s)** — know about osteoporosis is that that's a pretty severe situation and it's going to take a good
- **[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=672s)** — amount of time to fix this problem. And it could take actually up to six years of healthy
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=678s)** — eating. But I wanted to give you this background information so you have all the
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=682s)** — different pieces to this puzzle. What's very interesting too about medication for osteoporosis
- **[11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=687s)** — is that some of these medications, real popular medications, increase the risk for
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=693s)** — fractures, which we're trying to avoid. Now since we emphasize probably the most important
- **[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=699s)** — piece of this puzzle, which is K2, there's some additional information that you should
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzLGUM1hpUA&t=703s)** — know about that. And I put that video up right here. Check it out.
