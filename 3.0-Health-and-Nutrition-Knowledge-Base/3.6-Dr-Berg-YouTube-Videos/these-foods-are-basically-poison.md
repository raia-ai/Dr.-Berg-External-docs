- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the seven foods that you must never ever eat again.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=4s)** — These foods are promoted as healthy foods, but in reality, behind the scenes, they are not healthy at all.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=9s)** — In fact, they're going to make you sick. So we're going to go through all seven.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=12s)** — And number seven is very interesting because I tested this food in my basement on rats.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=19s)** — So you definitely want to stay till the end to hear about what happened.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=21s)** — Let's start with number one. Granola bars, right? Nature Valley sounds wonderful.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=26s)** — Is it really healthy? They promote using whole grains with just a touch of honey.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=31s)** — So let's take a look at the actual ingredients.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=34s)** — Now, I always like to ignore the nutritional facts because it doesn't really tell you much about what the ingredients are.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=41s)** — So let's look just at the ingredients. It says whole grain oats.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=44s)** — OK, so this doesn't tell us if it's organic or conventional.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=49s)** — But if we scroll all the way down, it says contains bioengineered food ingredients.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=55s)** — Now, what does that mean? It means that they have GMO ingredients, which they're going to have levels of glyphosate.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=61s)** — That's an herbicide. And General Mills, who owns this company, dropped the 100% natural because they got sued.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=69s)** — The problem is it contained a chemical called glyphosate, like I just mentioned, a weed killer, which is linked to cancer.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=75s)** — Now you have to realize that glyphosate is the main ingredient in Roundup Ready.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=79s)** — This is a popular herbicide, which, by the way, they were ordered to pay 300 million dollars to a man with terminal cancer.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=85s)** — After being exposed to that herbicide.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=88s)** — So the first thing to know is the whole grain oats are not organic.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=92s)** — Second thing is sugar. They don't tell you what kind of sugar, cane sugar, beet sugar.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=95s)** — Most likely it's beet sugar, which also is GMO.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=98s)** — And then we get into canola and or sunflower oil.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=102s)** — This is a seed oil, which is, from my viewpoint, not very healthy because it's going to create a lot of problems on the inside of your body.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=110s)** — It's high in omega 6. Then we get into the rice flour.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=113s)** — Okay, that's a starch highly refined.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=115s)** — When you're dealing with the starch, you're really dealing with sugar, right?
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=119s)** — That's what a starch is. It's a group of sugar molecules connected together.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=122s)** — Then we get honey. Like they said, only probably just a tiny bit of honey.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=126s)** — Salt, brown sugar, syrup.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=129s)** — When they make sugar into syrup, they have to refine it more.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=134s)** — And it's actually going to create a really nice spike when you consume it with your blood sugars.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=139s)** — One serving size equals just under seven teaspoons of sugar.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=144s)** — Alright, let's dive into number two. Agave syrup.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=148s)** — Now, this is a type of sweetener that a lot of people consider to be diabetic friendly, keto friendly, because it's low on the glycemic index.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=158s)** — It sounds very natural, but any time they make a product into a syrup, especially agave, you're going to create more fructose.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=168s)** — Now, the thing you need to know about fructose is only the liver can deal with fructose.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=173s)** — So, whereas cane sugar has about 50-50 glucose and fructose, agave syrup is literally 85% fructose.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=180s)** — Out of all the foods and sweeteners out there, agave has the most fructose.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=185s)** — It has even more fructose than high fructose corn syrup.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=188s)** — This means it's going to create a major problem for the liver.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=192s)** — Your liver treats fructose like it does alcohol, like a toxin.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=198s)** — And so, yes, it's low on the glycemic index, but it's going to create an indirect effect with insulin.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=205s)** — That's going to create the risk for diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=210s)** — You know, think about sugar or fructose. You're taking this sugar out of the normal food.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=215s)** — And you consume this in a concentrated amount, in large amounts.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=219s)** — This is not healthy. This is not good at all. It's going to create a lot of damage to the liver.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=223s)** — Number three, flavored yogurt. Right now, flavored and of course, they always add sugar to it.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=229s)** — You have this appearance that it's a healthy thing because it's a probiotic.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=234s)** — And it has calcium and has protein. It's very convenient.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=237s)** — People give this stuff to their kids all day long.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=240s)** — But you have to realize that most of these flavored yogurts have more sugar than a candy bar.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=244s)** — Tons of sugar. 30 grams per serving size. Okay. This is like way too much sugar.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=249s)** — And then when you're adding the sugar to the protein in it and all the other stuff,
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=253s)** — you're just going to feed your pathogens. Not the good bacteria.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=257s)** — And the amount of probiotics or beneficial microbes in this product is not very significant.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=262s)** — Most, if not all these microbes don't even survive the stomach acid.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=266s)** — Personally, I do not believe there's any benefits whatsoever of these probiotics going
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=272s)** — into the actual intestine and increasing your microbes.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=276s)** — Anytime you consume a yogurt, you want to consume it as the whole food, the whole fat.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=281s)** — You don't want any yogurts being with skim milk or low fat at all.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=286s)** — I mean, if you're going to do a yogurt, do Bulgarian yogurt,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=289s)** — do Greek yogurt without the added sugars. I mean, yogurt by itself has, you know,
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=295s)** — six grams of sugar per serving size. Why would you want to add more sugar?
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=299s)** — What's even better than yogurt is kefir. I do it plain.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=303s)** — You can even add berries to it. It's delicious.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=306s)** — But the difference between kefir and yogurt is that kefir has
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=310s)** — way more friendly bacteria. So you're going to get more diversified microbes if you have kefir
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=315s)** — than actual yogurt. But in these flavored yogurts, they put thickeners as modified
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=320s)** — cornstarch. They have MSG in their monosodium glutamate as a flavor enhancer.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=324s)** — So if you're consuming these flavored yogurts thinking that they're doing
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=327s)** — you some good health-wise, they're not. All right, next one on the list,
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=330s)** — non-dairy creamers that are considered a healthier alternative to milk and creams
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=336s)** — because they're lower in fat, right? But what's interesting is sometimes you don't even need to
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=340s)** — put them in the refrigerator. What is in these things? Well, there's a lot of crap in these
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=344s)** — things. They have high fructose corn syrup, they'll have glucose syrup, they'll have
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=348s)** — maltodextrin. And the type of fat that they use is trans fats. But a lot of times it's
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=354s)** — hidden because if you actually put trans fats, which are seed oils, if it's below a half
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=359s)** — of a gram per serving size, which is very easy to do in a non-dairy creamer, then they
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=366s)** — round it out to zero. And they can even say trans fat free, when in fact it has trans fats in there.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=372s)** — So you really want to look at the ingredients and make sure it has no seed oils. Soy,
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=378s)** — corn, canola, cottonseed. Just use regular cream, organic cream, organic half and half.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=384s)** — Then we get to my favorite soy milk. I mean, it's bizarre to me to think that
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=388s)** — they can even call it a milk. With the soy milk, you're getting a lot of estrogenic
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=393s)** — Personally, when I was in practice, I had a gentleman come in that started to develop
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=398s)** — breast tissue and he was consuming, I'm not kidding, gallons and gallons of soy milk every
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=403s)** — single week. So there's a lot of debate whether soy is healthy or not. Well, here's the thing,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=408s)** — the way that they process soy, soy oils, soy isolate proteins, soy milk, I still to this day
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=416s)** — do not understand how soy milk can be considered or perceived to be something healthy or
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=423s)** — cleaner than actual organic wheel milk or milk products. Then we get to number six,
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=429s)** — which is the fast food lettuce or salad. Okay, now no one's going to consume that salad
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=434s)** — without dressing. So it comes with dressing. And if you've ever read the ingredients in
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=440s)** — these dressings for the salad, massive seed oils, hidden trans fats, hidden starches,
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=446s)** — high fructose corn syrup. I mean, it's just another chemical cocktail that you put on your
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=450s)** — to try to think that you're eating something healthier. There's a chemical called sodium
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=455s)** — bisulfide. This is something that they put into the lettuce to preserve it so it doesn't turn
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=460s)** — brown. It's a chemical. So you don't really know how long that salad has been sitting
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=464s)** — there. But I think the biggest thing is they use a chlorine wash to make sure all the E.
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=470s)** — coli salmonella is killed off. Well, realize when they're killing off this bad
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=475s)** — also killing off the good stuff as well. And I don't want to eat a salad that has this
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=481s)** — chlorinated bleached chemical on it. The next time you want a salad, don't get it from a
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=486s)** — fast food restaurant. And the last food that I would highly recommend that you avoid puffed
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=491s)** — cereal, puffed rice cakes. There was this chemist and he worked for Quaker Oats. Okay,
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=497s)** — they fired him because he noticed when they did the study on rats with puffed cereal,
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=501s)** — they would die. So I set up this experiment in my basement. I had four separate cages. Okay,
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=505s)** — in the first group of mice, I fed them mice food. The second group of mice or rats, I fed
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=512s)** — whole wheat bread. Okay, third group, I fed white bread. And the fourth group, I fed puffed
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=519s)** — cereal. In one of the cages of rats, I noticed that the eyes started turning bright red
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=525s)** — and started bulging out. And these mice were actually dying prematurely. And this is after a
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=530s)** — week and a half to two weeks. Okay, now take a while to guess what group you think this was.
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=535s)** — Most of you are thinking it's the white bread, right? No, something in the puffed cereal created
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=539s)** — the eyes to turn bright red and it was literally bulging out and it was killing the mice. So
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=545s)** — Paul Stitt's experiments were actually true from my viewpoint. He wrote a book called
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=550s)** — Beating the Food Giants. You can probably get it on Amazon. He goes through the whole
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=554s)** — story. That was enough of an experiment to get me to stop consuming puffed cereals. But
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=559s)** — here's the wild thing that happened. I went on vacation for a week. I had to do this seminar and
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=564s)** — I told my wife to take care of the mice. Somehow the mice that survived got out of the
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=570s)** — cage. I don't know if you know my wife, Karen, right? She comes downstairs and she sees
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=574s)** — that the cage is open and all these mice are getting out. She freaked out, right? So this is
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=580s)** — why I have never duplicated that experiment. I'm not allowed to have any type of gerbils,
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=586s)** — hamsters, mice ever ever again. We had to have some people come out to catch these mice. When I
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=593s)** — finally got home, I went out in the woods and I let them go free. So anyway, now you know the
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=597s)** — seven foods to completely stay away from if you want to retain your health. And if you haven't
- **[10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBG8wWvModg&t=601s)** — seen this video on the healthiest food that you should be eating, I put that up right here. Check it out.
