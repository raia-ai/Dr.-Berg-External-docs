- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about Bill Gates' appeal and if it's safe. I did a pretty thorough
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=6s)** — research on Google to see if it was safe. And as I was reading the pages, it looked really safe.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=11s)** — In fact, it's been thoroughly fact checked. So we know it's probably going to be safe and we
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=15s)** — don't need to look any further. Until I took one additional look at the ingredients of this
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=22s)** — appeal. And one of the things that was listed is that 99.34% of this product is listed as
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=29s)** — other ingredients. Other ingredients? It doesn't tell you what's in it. So right there is a big red
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=35s)** — flag. There's no transparency. We do know that there are mono and diglycerides in there, which
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=41s)** — I'm going to talk about. But we don't know what else is in this product. Now, first of all,
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=44s)** — what is a mono or a diglyceride? It's a emulsifier. What's an emulsifier? It's something
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=51s)** — that helps to mix two things together. And I was able to look at the patents in this appeal
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=57s)** — product and really kind of see more about the manufacturing process because they're using
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=63s)** — solvents in this process. And then they'll put in a metal like palladium and then put it under
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=70s)** — high heats with hydrogen. So it's like a fat like substance that they're using, but they
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=76s)** — could be making this partially hydrogenated product, which is trans fats. That's how they
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=85s)** — called hydrogenation. And when you look a little bit more into this, you see that there's also
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=90s)** — traces of cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic. I'm like, what? But they're in very small amounts
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=99s)** — and they say that it's safe because it's below the certain standards that they use.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=105s)** — But my question is like, if you're consuming these chronically over time,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=109s)** — have you ever done safety studies on that? They also add polyethylene glycol. I mean, isn't that
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=114s)** — stuff they use in antifreeze? And these two solvents, for example. So are they toxic? Well,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=120s)** — they said that they take them out. But my other question is like, what chemical do you
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=125s)** — use to take those solvents out? And are those chemicals clean? They don't tell you. I did a
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=130s)** — video on this. This is the industry's loophole. They can do their own safety studies,
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=136s)** — submit them to the FDA, get them approved. In fact, trans fats at one time were
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=142s)** — generally recognized as safe until they found out they weren't safe. And also, if you have less
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=148s)** — than a half of a gram of trans fats, the FDA says you can round it down to zero trans fats.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=154s)** — But what was really interesting is this point that if you classify something like this as an
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=160s)** — emulsifier and not as a lipid, which is a fat, you're exempt from the FDA's ban of
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=168s)** — trans fats. Amazing. Now, there's also another controversy over whether this appeal is really a
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=175s)** — coating or a fungicide because both the EPA and the Organic Materials Review Institute
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=184s)** — says that it's a fungicide used after harvest. But appeal advertises this as a protective
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=191s)** — coating. So there's a lot of problems with this product. We don't know if they added
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=196s)** — carrageenan in there, which creates a lot of problems for people. And some of the other
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=201s)** — edible coatings that they use are things like beeswax, which I think is a lot better. But
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=207s)** — they also use shellac. I mean, don't they use shellac in woodworking, staining, or sometimes
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=214s)** — they'll put that on your nails? Is that safe? And then also sometimes they use paraffin wax,
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=219s)** — which is made from petroleum, which actually is flammable. So I learned a lot about these
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=225s)** — coatings that they're apparently putting on our fruits and vegetables, especially if you bring
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=229s)** — these fruits or vegetables home and you want to clean them off, right? So if you have this
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=235s)** — appeal coating around it, how are you going to take the pesticides out if it's conventional?
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=241s)** — Now they do have an organic version, but sometimes with these organic products, you don't
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=246s)** — know if those are any safer. Personally, I am not going to be buying my fruits or vegetables
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=251s)** — with a peel, because first of all, you can't clean it off, but you can actually maybe cut the peel
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=256s)** — off. But where is all the nutrition? Most of the nutrition is in the peel. So it's going
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=261s)** — to be really hard to take out any pesticides, insecticides, or any microbes. I mean, who knows
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=267s)** — if there's E. coli or salmonella? There's been outbreaks on that. But if you put that
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=272s)** — coating on there, that could actually seal that microbe in there. So as you can see,
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=277s)** — I have a lot of issues with this appeal. You might want to just buy fruits or vegetables that
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=282s)** — don't have this coating. And yes, they might go bad a little bit quicker. But at least you can
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=287s)** — wash them off with something more natural. If you want to know how to do that, you should watch
