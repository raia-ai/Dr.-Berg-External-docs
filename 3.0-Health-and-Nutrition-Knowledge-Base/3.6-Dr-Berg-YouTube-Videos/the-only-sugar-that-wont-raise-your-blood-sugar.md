- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to talk about the only sugar that won't raise your blood sugar. Now I see you're
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=6s)** — getting pretty excited about this, but before you get too excited, let me explain. Sugar is classified
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=12s)** — in a certain way. You have something called a monosaccharide and you have disaccharides.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=18s)** — So let's just talk about those first. So a monosaccharide is like one individual sugar
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=24s)** — glucose. That would be a monosaccharide. Mono meaning one, saccharide means sugar.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=30s)** — And you also have another monosaccharide called fructose. And if you combine these different
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=35s)** — monosaccharides together, you have different types of sugar. For example, table sugar
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=40s)** — is about 50% fructose and 50% glucose. And then you have honey, which is 30% fructose
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=50s)** — and 70% glucose. Then you have other sugars like lactose. That's like milk sugar. That would be
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=57s)** — glucose plus another type of monosaccharide called galactose. And then you have something
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=63s)** — called high fructose corn syrup because it's a combination of glucose and fructose. It could
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=68s)** — range anywhere between 55 to 90% fructose. And then you have agave nectar, which is combined
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=75s)** — glucose and fructose. And fructose in agave nectar is about 85%. So it's a lot of fructose.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=83s)** — Then you have fruit. Fruit is a combination of glucose plus fructose. But the fructose and
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=90s)** — fruit can vary between 1% and 30%. Now you're probably saying like, what would be 1%? Well,
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=96s)** — it could be like avocados. That would be considered a fruit or maybe olives. That
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=105s)** — is interesting. What's interesting about fructose is that it's the only sugar that does not
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=112s)** — activate the beta cells. That's the cells in the pancreas that release insulin.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=117s)** — It does not increase your blood sugars, at least initially. When you think about it,
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=124s)** — when you go to the doctor to get your blood sugar tested, they're not going to be checking
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=128s)** — how much fructose that's in the blood. They're going to be checking how much glucose is in
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=134s)** — blood. Two completely different monosaccharides. And fructose as a sugar is like twice as sweet
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=141s)** — as table sugar. And this is another reason why manufacturing companies might be putting
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=147s)** — fructose in our food because it's just sweeter. If you take artificial sweeteners,
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=151s)** — you're talking about a factor of like 10,000 to 100,000 times sweeter than sugar. So that's
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=158s)** — why you need just a tiny bit. And humans lack the enzyme to convert fructose into glucose.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=166s)** — So when this was studied and realized that, wow, fructose does not increase your blood sugar,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=171s)** — they started to recommend it for diabetics. But let me explain the other half of the story,
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=176s)** — okay? Because fructose follows a different biochemical pathway than glucose. Glucose is
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=184s)** — by all the cells, but fructose is only really absorbed by the liver. Some of it passes
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=190s)** — through the intestine because it's not easily absorbed and it can get into the colon,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=195s)** — where your microbes have a frenzy, okay? It's kind of like crack to your microbes and they
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=200s)** — will start eating this up and start growing rapidly. And you'll get a lot of gas and
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=204s)** — sometimes diarrhea and a lot of digestive bloating and all sorts of digestive problems.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=209s)** — This is why a lot of people cannot do fruit or just fructose in general. But what about
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=215s)** — the stuff that's absorbed to the liver? I want to talk about that because that fructose in your
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=220s)** — liver, that can be converted to glucose and stored as glycogen. Now, if there's enough
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=226s)** — glycogen stored in the liver, then the body will instantly start making triglycerides,
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=232s)** — which are blood fats and cholesterol. It's been well documented that fructose will make a
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=238s)** — very fatty liver very quickly if you consume enough of it, right? But we don't consume very
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=242s)** — much of it. Well, it just so happens that kids, for example, 25% of their calories
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=250s)** — are in the form of fructose on average. That is crazy. So we're consuming a massive amount
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=258s)** — of fructose in many different forms. The other problem with your liver becoming fatty
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=264s)** — and you producing all these triglycerides is that will now create insulin resistance
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=270s)** — in a bad way, more potently than glucose. So now we're going to actually go right into diabetes
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=277s)** — a lot quicker. And now the body is going to produce more insulin indirectly. So just because
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=282s)** — fructose is low on the glycemic index and it won't raise your blood sugars, it will do
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=287s)** — indirectly and create problems way worse than glucose, but in a different way. I'm sorry,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=294s)** — you just kind of got excited there, right? You thought maybe you could start consuming fructose.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=298s)** — Well, you don't want to do that. That fructose will also be converted to uric acid, right? So
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=302s)** — now your gout increases as well. And the more uric acid you have in the kidney, the less
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=309s)** — vitamin D you're going to activate because the activation of vitamin D happens mainly in the
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=313s)** — kidney. So that could be another problem. And we're going to end up with more inflammation
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=317s)** — and also profound atherosclerosis. That's right. It leads right to the clogging or the
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=324s)** — plucking of your arteries. Now in certain mice studies, and by the way, like mice and humans
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=329s)** — don't have that enzyme to convert fructose to glucose, there is shown a spike in homocysteine
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=336s)** — by 72%. Also, you're going to get low leptin levels and that has everything to do with your
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=342s)** — appetite. So you're naturally going to not get satisfied and you're going to overeat when you
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=347s)** — consume fructose. Probably another reason why they use high fructose curds syrup in so many
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=353s)** — drinks is to get you to drink more and more because you're not going to be satisfied.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=359s)** — Given that information, you can have alternative sugars. Okay, these are called sugar alcohols.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-G6ucSsyw&t=366s)** — And for that information, you should watch this video right here.
