- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=0s)** — The one vitamin that reverses nerve damage.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=4s)** — The reason I want to talk about this one vitamin is because it's the most common deficiency behind most nerve problems.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=11s)** — Let's start with viruses.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=13s)** — And I'm talking about two viruses that have the potential to go into the nerves on the face and create conditions like Bell's palsy.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=21s)** — They can hide in this little nerve bundle called the ganglia.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=24s)** — It's like a mini brain within the nerves that have this bundle of nerve cells.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=28s)** — What's unique about it is the viruses go into those areas, those little bundles, to evade the immune system and kind of fly underneath the radar.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=39s)** — And what the viruses do is they can turn off something called autophagy.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=44s)** — Autophagy is a condition where you're recycling damaged proteins, but you're also recycling pathogens, bacteria, yeast, fungus, molds, and viruses.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=54s)** — And because they're in this nerve bundle, they can hide with our immune system and they just kind of go to sleep.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=59s)** — And our immune system doesn't know that they're there because they're not really doing anything, but just waiting for your stress to go up.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=67s)** — Because when you have stress, you have cortisol.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=69s)** — Cortisol is an immune suppressant.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=71s)** — One of the most severe stresses that someone can go through is an emotional stress.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=76s)** — And this is why a lot of these dormant viruses come out of remission after a stress event.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=81s)** — Loss of a loved one is a huge one. Loss of money.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=84s)** — And I've seen this a lot of times in practice with someone with a herpes virus or even shingles.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=89s)** — I'll ask them what happened just before this and sure enough, it was a stress event.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=93s)** — And they can come out and create other problems too, like fibromyalgia.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=96s)** — Also problems on your face as well.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=98s)** — There's one thing unique about those viruses.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=101s)** — They need the amino acid called arginine to exist.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=105s)** — And it just so happens that arginine competes with another amino acid called lysine.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=109s)** — If you have enough lysine, you can block arginine and stop the reproduction of this virus.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=116s)** — You have to take a lot of lysine to kind of compete and block arginine.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=122s)** — You want to take a thousand milligrams to three thousand milligrams every single day for a period of time
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=127s)** — to put that virus back in remission as well as do whatever you can do to reduce stress.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=132s)** — Let's take another nerve problem, sciatica.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=134s)** — That usually comes from a disc issue.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=137s)** — A lot of people with disc problems are deficient in copper.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=139s)** — If you have sciatica, you may want to try either taking a supplement with copper or just putting copper cream topically around that area in your back
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=147s)** — where it originates to reduce the discomfort.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=150s)** — Next condition is carpal tunnel syndrome. That's in your wrist.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=153s)** — This is usually a B6 deficiency.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=156s)** — The primary nerve that supports myelin is B12.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=160s)** — And that would be another type of nerve problem because if you're deficient in B12,
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=163s)** — you can get like electric shock-like sensations in your nervous system.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=168s)** — Very, very painful or even numbness.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=170s)** — And that's because B12 is involved with the myelin sheath around the nerve.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=175s)** — That's the outer covering that protects the nerve that insulates the nerve that allows the signals to transmit.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=179s)** — Then we get to MS.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=180s)** — Okay, this is an autoimmune disease.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=182s)** — This can definitely affect your nerves, your brain.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=185s)** — Vitamin D3 is essential in reducing inflammation within the nerve cells and also your brain cells.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=193s)** — You need to take large amounts of vitamin D3.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=196s)** — 50, 60, 70, 80 thousand I use of vitamin D3 to put that condition into remission.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=204s)** — There's a lot of research on this using something called the Coimbra protocol,
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=208s)** — which I will put a link down below for more information about that.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=211s)** — Now let's get into the most common nerve problem that exists.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=214s)** — And that is something relating to either pre-diabetes or diabetes.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=218s)** — A lot of people with diabetes end up with nerve problems in their feet.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=222s)** — They get numbness in the toes first and then it kind of starts traveling in the foot.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=226s)** — The bottom of the foot becomes painful.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=229s)** — The sugar in the blood is creating such a demand for this one vitamin.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=235s)** — That vitamin is called vitamin B1 thiamine.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=238s)** — I would take it in the form of benfotamine because that tends to penetrate the myelin
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=244s)** — and get right into the nerve and very quickly reverse nerve damage.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=248s)** — That's caused from the high sugar.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=250s)** — The more carbohydrates or sugar someone consumes, the greater the need for B1.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=255s)** — If you're a pre-diabetic or you're diabetic, you have a lot of sugar going through the bloodstream.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=259s)** — That means you're going to need even more B1 to compensate.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=262s)** — But of course, if you just come off the sugar, that might be a better solution.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=266s)** — But benfotamine, this is a fat soluble version of B1, is the best antidote for peripheral neuropathy
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=273s)** — because B1 is necessary for the metabolism of carbohydrates.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=278s)** — And just as a very important side note, in order for B1 to work,
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=284s)** — there's another cofactor that you need and that's magnesium.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=287s)** — But I wanted to create this video kind of short and to the point and cover the most common issues
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMCBTDpDVU&t=292s)** — relating to nerves and what nutrients you should focus on to hopefully reduce those problems.
