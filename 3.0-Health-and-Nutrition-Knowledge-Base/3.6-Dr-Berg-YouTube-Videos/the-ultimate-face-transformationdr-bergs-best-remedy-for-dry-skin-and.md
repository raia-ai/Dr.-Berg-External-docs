- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the ultimate face remedy for both wrinkly and dry skin.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=6s)** — The skin is the largest organ in the body. And anything that you put on the skin gets absorbed
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=11s)** — inside into the body, eventually through the liver. And it's amazing what types of things people
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=16s)** — put on their skin. I mean, just all sorts of chemical lotions and makeup, you name it.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=23s)** — They scrub the skin, they sterilize it. You have friendly bacteria on your skin, right? And
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=28s)** — you sterilize it, the skin becomes red. It dries out. Or sometimes it becomes too oily. So it's
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=34s)** — very important to understand not to put anything on your skin that could be toxic.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=38s)** — Compound that with pollution. If someone smokes secondhand smoke, or let's say you smoke,
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=44s)** — and all that goes into the body. I mean, you have fluoride and chloride in your shower,
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=49s)** — with it hitting your skin. You have the sun's UV radiation that damages the skin. And then
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=59s)** — alcohol or consumption of trans fats, all that goes into the body and it can greatly affect the
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=64s)** — skin. I think one of the worst things for the skin is going on a low fat diet, because
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=70s)** — skin is mainly protein and fat. And I remember in practice when I would see people come in
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=76s)** — that are low fat diet, even on the keto diet, and they're on low fat, as in the ideal
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=81s)** — where they're using this low carb and extremely low fat diet. And of course,
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=88s)** — the ingredients are very poor. Like I think they use soy protein isolates as a protein.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=93s)** — I noticed very quickly the person starts looking older, not just their skin, but their hair.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=98s)** — They just age. The more junk food that we eat, the faster the aging of our skin.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=104s)** — What is alter process food? Well, now they synthesize
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=108s)** — corn to turn that into corn sugar or high fructose corn syrup. So you have this synthesized,
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=114s)** — synthetic sugars, you have these synthetic starches, right, corn starches. And then you
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=120s)** — have something probably even more deadly, which is the oils, the seed oils, highly
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=127s)** — industrialized, highly refined, very unstable oil that tends to create a lot of oxidation
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=133s)** — in the body. I mean, it creates inflammation in the inside of the arteries and the organs
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=137s)** — and the different tissues. And what about on the skin? Right. The thing about these oils is it
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=142s)** — gets lodged into our membranes and our skin, and it stays in there for two and a half to
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=148s)** — three years. And so when you have too much of these seed oils, right, that's omega six.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=154s)** — Okay. And not enough of the omega three oils, that's like fish oils or cod liver oil.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=159s)** — You start developing flaky, dry, red skin because they both compete with each other. And I'm
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=165s)** — talking about like soy oil, corn oil, canola, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=173s)** — These are all highly processed oils with the usolvents like hexane. They deodorize it,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=179s)** — decolorize it. I mean, a lot of these omega six oils like sunflower oil, for example, are in
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=186s)** — facial creams. It's going to dry out your skin. It's going to make your skin older. So you also
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=192s)** — want to make sure there's no alcohol in your skin creams. So in the last 100 years, we
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=198s)** — basically have been increasing the seed oils in our diet to a factor of 1600% more. And even
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=206s)** — in the last 20 years, we've doubled the amount of seed oils. Highly inflammatory,
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=211s)** — oxidizes the skin. In fact, I'm thinking about doing like a 30-day seed oil detox. I'm going to
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=218s)** — call it an oil change, right? Just to see how many health benefits would happen, not just
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=223s)** — with your skin, but the whole body by just avoiding these oils for a short period of time.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=229s)** — What would be the thing to put on the skin? Well, are you sitting down for this?
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=234s)** — Grass-fed tallow. That's actually beef fat. Now, before you click off, just hear me out.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=240s)** — It might sound disgusting, but the chemistry of tallow is very similar to the chemistry of
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=247s)** — part of your skin. In fact, the Latin word for tallow means sebum. That's like the oil
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=254s)** — that your body produces, the skin oil. Tallow will not oxidize the skin. It will not cause
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=261s)** — inflammation. It has vitamin A, D, E, K. It also has something called CLA, which tends to retain
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=271s)** — moisture in the skin. And tallow is not like coconut oil, which will make your skin really
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=276s)** — greasy and oily. It gives your skin a very nice softness, a healthy glow, and a lot of
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=281s)** — the nutrients in this tallow can also help some of the dark spots as well in the skin,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=286s)** — and help wrinkles. You should just try it for a week and just see what happens. Now,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=291s)** — as far as the type of fat that's in here, you have about 50% of its actual saturated fats.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=297s)** — You also have oleic acid, which is a really good moisturizer. You have palmitic acid,
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=304s)** — which softens the skin. You also have stearic acid, which repairs the skin. And then you have
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=309s)** — linoleic acid. That's at omega-6, but it's only like 2%. So it's very, very small numbers.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=316s)** — So I'm not recommending a certain brand of tallow, but you can just look at the reviews and
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=321s)** — just read what people are reporting. But you start using tallow on your skin instead of
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=326s)** — regular chemical moisturizers with omega-6 oils, and you're going to see a huge,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=333s)** — huge change. And there's no chemicals in it. And it's kind of a forgotten secret because
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=337s)** — we used to use this long ago, but then we replaced it because someone came up with this idea
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=343s)** — that, oh, saturated fat is bad for us. No, unsaturated fats in the quantities that we're
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=350s)** — consuming them. And then the type of these unsaturated fats that we're using is just
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=354s)** — so unhealthy. So if you did the combination of two things, just get rid of these
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=360s)** — omega-6 seed oils out of your diet, and you start using tallow on your skin,
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=365s)** — and you start consuming fish oils or cod liver oil for the omega-3, within a matter of weeks,
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=372s)** — I think you're going to see a huge shift in your skin. So go ahead and try this and then
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGu8php0XoY&t=377s)** — comment down below. And if you have not seen my video on how to address dry wrinkly hands,
