- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to show you the magic formula for being calm under pressure or being relaxed
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=7s)** — in stressful situations. You know, sometimes we can't control our environments, but we can
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=12s)** — definitely control our attitude towards stress. And I have some very important information to
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=18s)** — share with you based on this book right here called Relax and Win. This is by an author,
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=22s)** — Bud Winters, who was a coach for 30 years and guided athletes to over 37 world records.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=29s)** — And there's some great data I want to share with you in this book. Some things you can do to train
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=34s)** — yourself to be calm in stressful situations. Now before I start, go ahead and comment down below
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=40s)** — how you cope with stress. Is it good? Is it bad? Do you use medication, drugs, junk food,
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=47s)** — sugar, smoking, alcohol? Just make a note in the comment section. I'm just very curious.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=54s)** — I mean, the significance of how stress affects our body is massive. Have you ever heard
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=58s)** — of stress-induced ulcers? Or what about stress-induced diabetes? How could that possibly occur?
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=65s)** — Especially if you're not eating a lot of sugar or junk foods. Well, stress activates two
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=71s)** — hormones. One is called cortisol and the other one is adrenaline. And both of those actually
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=76s)** — switch the fuel that you run on. It basically switches the body to run on glucose, even
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=82s)** — you're not consuming sugar or carbs. The body takes your protein and turns it into
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=89s)** — glucose. And that's called gluconeogenesis. And so going through chronic stress can actually
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=95s)** — cause you to have diabetes and of course lose your muscles. That's called atrophy.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=100s)** — You can actually get fat from stress. You can even develop cancer from stress from different
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=106s)** — ways. It suppresses the white blood cells. It inhibits the immune system from working
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=111s)** — and it causes viruses to come out of remission and be active as an Epstein-Barr virus and the
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=117s)** — herpes viruses as well as developing autoimmune diseases like MS, Hashimoto's, lupus,
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=125s)** — rheumatoid arthritis. Nearly every person in practice that I've talked to that developed an
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=129s)** — autoimmune disease always had some stress event that occurred right before it. And it's
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=134s)** — usually chronic stress or some major loss. There's also a thing called stress-induced
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=140s)** — stroke or stress-induced heart attack. Stress can cause infertility, definitely insomnia,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=147s)** — lack of oxygen throughout the body, muscle tension, and this other thing called cortisol
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=152s)** — resistance where you just get a lot more inflammation. So even now stress kicks in
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=157s)** — cortisol which is an anti-inflammatory. Over a period of time you develop this resistance to
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=163s)** — cortisol and now you're inflamed because you're lacking cortisol inside the cells. And this is
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=169s)** — where they give people prednisone. And prednisone is a synthetic type of cortisol just like they
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=174s)** — might give insulin to a diabetic type too to override this resistance to insulin or even
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=182s)** — the prednisone overrides the resistance to cortisol. And look at all the side effects
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=185s)** — that occur with prednisone. Diabetes, complete destruction of the joints. So I think
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=191s)** — it's really important to understand this stress component. You know, when you're under stress,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=196s)** — your ability to solve problems, your ability to be creative is going to be greatly inhibited.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=202s)** — Why? Because you're stuck in your head. Pictures and your memories of stressful events, your
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=209s)** — ability to be creative and solve problems occur when you're in more of the present,
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=213s)** — when you're calm, when you have a better state of mind, when you have more space. This is why
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=218s)** — I always recommend going for a walk. So this book is interesting because after World War II,
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=225s)** — this author took the same techniques which taught people who flew planes to relax under
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=231s)** — pressure of combat and applied them to sports. And the results were not only good, they were
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=237s)** — amazing. 37 world records. Incredible. He also talks about like Joe Lewis, the great boxer,
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=245s)** — Joe DiMaggio, a great baseball player, and noted they all had sleepy relaxed looks on their
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=252s)** — arms were kind of dangled. What's more important is they let nothing bother them, whether it was
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=260s)** — hot or cold, whether the stadium was full or empty, whether the competition proved vicious or
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=265s)** — gentle. So one of the things you have to do is you have to really train yourself to have
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=270s)** — a relaxed attitude. One of the things that the author talks about is working on relaxing
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=276s)** — the antagonistic muscle. If you're just sitting there right now, right, if you just kind of scan
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=283s)** — your body where you're holding your tension, with me, it's in the upper back, the neck,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=289s)** — and lower back. So if you can just let those areas go and just focusing on relaxing those
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=297s)** — areas, that would be one thing you can do. He talks about also relaxing the wrinkles. You
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=306s)** — start relaxing them, relaxing your jaw muscles and your tongue. Okay, because so many people
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=311s)** — hold tension in their jaws. A lot of people hold tension in their gut, especially when they
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=318s)** — eat. So when you eat, you should slow your eating, chew more, and really relax your whole
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=324s)** — digestive system. That'll help not just digestion, but it'll actually help you sleep
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=329s)** — at night. Because I think the number one reason why people don't sleep is they have certain
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=334s)** — parts of their body that are under tension. And so you have to actively kind of let those muscles
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=340s)** — go. So these are little exercises that you can do on a regular basis. And these are meant
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=345s)** — mainly for athletes, but I would apply this to anyone. When I was in wrestling in high school
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=350s)** — and college, before a match, I would literally be so nervous. I would have the adrenaline
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=356s)** — pumping through my heart. I would just feel this pounding, just incredibly loud. And I was
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=362s)** — so freaked out. The last thing I was is relaxed. In fact, when I went to state, I started getting
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=367s)** — more nervous. And of course, that did not lead to a good performance. But the person that did
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=372s)** — take first place in state at 185 pounds, I remember watching him. He was basically almost like
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=381s)** — bored before doing the final match. He was just sitting there just completely and utterly
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=386s)** — relaxed. And that's a good state to be because the more stress you have, the more
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=390s)** — nervous tension, the more muscular tension, the less good performance you're going to have in
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=395s)** — that competition because you're going to choke. You're not going to be able to think clearly.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=399s)** — I remember another incident in college. In order to graduate, I had to give this speech and I had
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=406s)** — a terror of public speaking. I had to go up in front of my peers and do this presentation.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=412s)** — I was this close to dropping out of college. And I don't know how I got through it, but it
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=416s)** — very, very nerve wracking. And so public speaking is another fear that a lot of people have.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=421s)** — And the way that I overcame it is I basically just forced myself to do a lot of presentations.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=427s)** — I think I did 4,900 presentations over a period of time to get rid of that fear of public
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=432s)** — speaking. I think the goal should be really have the viewpoint of being carefree and calm
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=440s)** — under stressful situations. No matter how stressful things are, you have to just change your
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=446s)** — mind and have a relaxed viewpoint. And that also includes controlling your breathing,
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=453s)** — breathing through your nose. I remember I went out to dinner with a patient of mine and
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=459s)** — as we were talking, she started to choke on her food. She couldn't breathe. And here I am
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=465s)** — in this restaurant and I have to give someone the Heimlich maneuver and I have to remember
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=469s)** — to do it. So I started to do it and it didn't work. And I can see her eyes were bloodshot
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=475s)** — and she's turning blue. And thank God I just said, sit down and just totally relax,
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=482s)** — calm down. And that's when things started to open up in her throat. So anytime someone's in
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=488s)** — a panic mood, you want them just to calm down and you want them to breathe normally if
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=493s)** — they can breathe, especially through their nose. Or else they're going to basically be
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=498s)** — starving for oxygen in this panic attack. So a lot of times when people are stressed out
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=502s)** — and they're stuck in the past and not in the present. And so this is so important to connect
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=507s)** — with your environment, to go for a walk in nature, to do something physical. Whether it's
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=512s)** — something like bird watching or playing with your animal or playing some sport or being active
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=517s)** — in your environment that kind of pulls you out of that stress. So you have more control
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=522s)** — your thoughts. And as a side note to that, B1, natural B1 can really help those excessive
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=529s)** — thoughts that randomly just go through your mind at night and through the day as well.
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=534s)** — So if you're deficient in B1 because you're doing too many carbs, that can actually create
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=538s)** — a bad effect. But taking some natural B1 will put you in a state where within minutes
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=543s)** — you just feel like, oh, I feel calm more myself. Now the other thing that I recommend
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=548s)** — is when you exercise, you should maintain a relaxed body. You're going to have less injuries,
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=557s)** — you're going to have better performance. Even when you walk or hike, relax every part of
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=562s)** — your body. Find out where you hold tension, is it in your ankles? Find out if you're kind
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=567s)** — of limping to one side because of an old injury and start to walk and relax every part
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=572s)** — of your body, including your upper back and your muscle and your jaw and try to breathe
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=576s)** — Okay, so here's some other things out of the book. To get rid of all your tensions in your
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=580s)** — head and your neck, drop your shoulders as low as they'll go. Get them down there and then lower
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=586s)** — them even more. When you breathe out, let the tensions go out of your body. Remember to breathe
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=591s)** — slowly and regularly. As you exhale, drop your tensions. Talk to your right bicep. Tell it to
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=598s)** — let go. Then to your left bicep. Then the muscles on the front part of your body. Then
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=603s)** — muscles on the back part of your body. Then the right leg and then the left leg.
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=607s)** — Imagine your body like a jellyfish. You have no bones in your left arm.
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=610s)** — It just sags. Just let it go. Let the tensions go. If you have any trouble relaxing your arms,
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=616s)** — clench your fist tightly and then let it go and see the difference. I think one of the
- **[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=621s)** — things that people run into is that when they kind of scan their body for tensions,
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=626s)** — they might not be able to identify where these tensions are. So I notice another thing
- **[10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=632s)** — you can do. I bought this. It's called the mobility stick. There's a whole series of
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=637s)** — stretches that you can do that are very different and they create a lot of very cool
- **[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=643s)** — stretches in certain positions that you don't normally get into. So when you put your body
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=647s)** — through these range of motions, I'm laterally flexing this way and rotating as I'm stretching.
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=652s)** — I'm finding tension in my body that I never knew that I had. I would never find those
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=657s)** — unless I put my body in those really strange positions because going the other way,
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=664s)** — it's totally fine. But going to the left, it's really restricted. And I noticed when I worked
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=669s)** — out those areas of tension, I had the best night's sleep. So sometimes you have to go
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=674s)** — through a range of motion and stretching to find out where your tensions are. So you can
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=678s)** — start working on relaxing those tensions either with letting them go or just stretching your
- **[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=684s)** — muscles. And then we have also this hormone called oxytocin. I talked about this in other
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=689s)** — videos. Oxytocin is that hormone that assist in the bonding of a mother to their child after
- **[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=698s)** — birth. They call it the love hormone. But there's some other things about oxytocin that
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=703s)** — can help directly lower cortisol and stress. And some of the things that can increase
- **[11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=712s)** — oxytocin is bonding with a pet or an animal or even donating or contributing to something,
- **[11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=719s)** — which is really helping another. I don't know of anyone who's helping a lot of people
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=725s)** — who are always in a stress state. This video might be a simple video, but I think it's
- **[12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=729s)** — really important. If you have not seen my video on doing like a stress extraction technique
- **[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=738s)** — using manual therapy, this is another thing that I think if you add to what I talked about,
- **[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZx0KMCOSs4&t=744s)** — it can greatly reduce your stress and help you sleep. I put that video up right here. Check it out.
