- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=0s)** — Yeah, I want to bring up some really underappreciated factors in the relationship to treating the
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=7s)** — thyroid, especially hypothyroidism with Synthroid or some other synthetic hormones. You know,
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=14s)** — unfortunately, this is not a short-term treatment. It's a long-term treatment. And so, you're taking
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=21s)** — this hormone like what are the side effects? Are there any side effects other than the total
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=25s)** — dependency on this hormone that you're taking? But there's another side effect that I want to
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=29s)** — talk about that you probably are not aware of. When someone takes Synthroid over a period of time,
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=35s)** — especially if it's post-menopausal, there's a higher risk of getting bone loss or osteoporosis
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=41s)** — or even osteopenia. So the question is why and how that relates to maybe a better option. So
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=49s)** — this video mainly relates to those people who want to continue to do conventional care. They
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=55s)** — don't want to do alternative care and or they're already on Synthroid. This is a really important
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=61s)** — video for those people. You know, a lot of times when you get hormone therapy, whether it's
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=65s)** — estrogen therapy or even thyroid therapy, you're given this one hormone. But I have an
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=71s)** — interesting question. If you're getting treatment for the thyroid with one hormone
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=76s)** — and the thyroid produces more than one hormone, what's happening with these other hormones? Or
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=83s)** — say for example, you get a thyroidectomy, the complete thyroid removed, right? And then they
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=89s)** — treat it with one hormone, which is T4. So what about the other hormones? What about T3? What
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=96s)** — about T2? What about T1? That's right. And what about calcitonin? Calcitonin is another
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=104s)** — hormone in your body and guess what? It's produced by the thyroid gland. So if you had
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=109s)** — thyroid removed or you have hypothyroidism, what's happening with that hormone? Where is it coming
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=116s)** — from? And why isn't your doctor giving it to you? Well, they might say, well, we don't really
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=122s)** — understand that hormone. It doesn't seem to be a problem. But let's just take a look at what
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=128s)** — it does. Okay, so you can understand that it does create problems if you're not taking it.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=134s)** — So calcitonin has everything to do with regulating calcium. It works with another gland
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=141s)** — called the parathyroid hormone produced by the parathyroid, which is connected to the
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=146s)** — thyroid. You have four of them, two in the top, two in the bottom. So both the thyroid
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=150s)** — and the parathyroid work together to help balance mainly calcium, but also other things
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=157s)** — like phosphorus and even to a lesser degree magnesium. So what calcitonin does is it
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=164s)** — inhibits the breakdown of bone. Okay, there's certain cells in the bone that are called
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=170s)** — osteoclasts and they break down bone to release calcium into the bloodstream. Whereas the
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=176s)** — parathyroid hormone will increase calcium. It helps to mobilize calcium from the bone. So you
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=182s)** — can see this teeter-totter effect between these two glands. Well, what happens when you have your
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=188s)** — thyroid removed or your parathyroid removed? Either one. And here's the problem. When they
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=193s)** — take out the thyroid, how do you preserve the parathyroid without damaging them? You
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=198s)** — must have to either leave some pieces in there or sometimes maybe just remove the whole
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=202s)** — thing. I don't know. But these parathyroid glands are very delicate and they're connected
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=207s)** — to the thyroid. So many times when you remove one thing, the other is affected. Anyhow,
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=212s)** — if you have your thyroid extracted or the parathyroid, you're now at risk for bone loss.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=218s)** — Okay, whether it's osteopenia, osteoporosis. And now you know why. Because you just removed
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=224s)** — the two key hormones that help regulate calcium. Now there's another kind of ignored
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=231s)** — syndrome that there's not a lot of information about but it's called hungry bone syndrome.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=238s)** — Where the bone just starts absorbing all this calcium, leaving the blood extremely low in
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=244s)** — calcium. And this occurs when you either have your thyroid removed or especially when you
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=249s)** — have your parathyroid removed. So now we have this other problem. We have low calcium in the
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=254s)** — blood. Okay, here are the symptoms. And you should just know this. If you have these symptoms,
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=259s)** — this could be why. You know, you just don't have enough of these hormones that regulate
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=263s)** — calcium. So you might have numbness around the mouth or even in the extremities, hands and feet.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=269s)** — Also muscle spasms. You have tetany twitching in your muscles and various cramps maybe that
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=276s)** — wake you up in the middle of the night. And you have certain bleeding or bruising because
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=280s)** — calcium is also involved in the clotting factors. And without enough calcium,
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=284s)** — it's hard to clot. But also realize you might be low in phosphorus which affects your
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=289s)** — ability to make ATP, which is the energy reserve in the body, as well as a lowered amount of
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=295s)** — magnesium. So these are just things that you should know about going into a surgery for your
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=301s)** — thyroid or if you have hypothyroidism and you're getting treated or you're on
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=306s)** — synthroid. They even have a treatment. It's giving someone calcitonin from salmon for
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=314s)** — osteoporosis. Too much calcium in the blood. It's called hypercalciumium
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=318s)** — because calcitonin helps lower calcium. And it's even used as a treatment for spinal stenosis,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=324s)** — which happens to be like a buildup of calcium in the spinal cord causing pain. Things like that.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=329s)** — So I think it's really important to understand that these glands make more than one hormone.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=335s)** — And if you're going to get treated with synthroid for some reason, I would bring up
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=341s)** — the argument for taking armor thyroid. It comes from a natural source, an animal source,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=347s)** — but at least armor has T4, T3, T2, T1 and calcitonin. It was what they used before they
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=357s)** — developed synthroid. It might be more difficult for the doctor to regulate,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=363s)** — but it contains all these hormones. So why wouldn't you want to take that or at least
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=367s)** — maybe take both? I don't know, but you can work that out with your doctor. But the point
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=371s)** — is when someone says that, well, we don't do that anymore, you better have a good reason for
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=378s)** — it. For example, it's not going to create any problems. Well, show them the references
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=382s)** — down in the description of this video of the higher risk for getting osteoporosis. Maybe
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=388s)** — they're just not aware of it. I just wanted to put this information on your radar. And I
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=392s)** — think it's really relevant to talk about the deeper causes of the thyroid as well. And I put
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCWeTFsI2Lc&t=397s)** — that information in this video right here.
