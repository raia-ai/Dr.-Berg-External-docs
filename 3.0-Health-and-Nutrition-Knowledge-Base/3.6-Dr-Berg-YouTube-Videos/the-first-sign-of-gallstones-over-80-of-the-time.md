- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=0s)** — Today we are going to discuss the first symptom that occurs with gallstones over 80% of the time.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=8s)** — And I am also going to talk about the fastest way to dissolve a gallstone if you have a gallstone.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=14s)** — And let's dive right into the first symptom that occurs over 80% of the time. And that would be
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=20s)** — asymptomatic. That's right. There is no symptoms 80% of the time when a person has gallstones.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=27s)** — You don't even know you have them. Unless they get lodged into a duct where it creates
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=32s)** — distension and pressure, you might even not know you have them until they get really bad.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=37s)** — Other than that, are there any other symptoms? And yes, there is. You are normally going to feel
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=42s)** — a sensation underneath the right rib cage. Kind of like a fullness, a tightness, or a pain.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=49s)** — You may feel pain in your right rhomboid, that muscle between your scapula and the mid
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=55s)** — part of your spine and the back part there. You may even have pain that runs up to this side
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=59s)** — of your face right here. These are all indications that there is something going on with the gall
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=64s)** — bladder. It doesn't necessarily have to be a stone. It could be very small micro stones
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=70s)** — that are really hard to identify even on an MRI. You can also experience nausea, vomiting,
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=79s)** — bloating, belching, jaundice. Now why would you have jaundice, like where your skin is
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=83s)** — yellow? Well that's because the gallstone is blocking the bile duct and we are getting a
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=88s)** — backup of bile into the liver and that is coming out through into the blood and into your skin.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=94s)** — And some of that is something called bilirubin, which is kind of a byproduct of your red
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=98s)** — blood cells and that can create a yellowing effect of your skin. You may also notice that
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=102s)** — your urine is darker than it should be, yet your stool is pale. It's no longer dark brown.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=110s)** — Now let's talk about how to get rid of a gallstone really quick. It really is important for you to
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=116s)** — understand what causes a gallstone first and that will explain everything. Many people think
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=123s)** — gallstones come from consuming too much fat, fatty foods, right? Or foods high in cholesterol
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=129s)** — because a gallstone is made out of cholesterol. So just by knowing that if you eat more
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=136s)** — you're at risk for getting a stone, right? Well actually no, you're not. The reason why stones
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=143s)** — develop is for two reasons. One is you have this high amount of cholesterol coming through
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=150s)** — the body and, and this is the most important thing, you have a lack of bile salts. And this
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=156s)** — number two thing is usually ignored. They think it's just the cholesterol, but what keeps the
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=161s)** — cholesterol thinned is the bile salts. Bile is the primary mode of elimination of cholesterol.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=169s)** — Okay, it goes to the bile ducts. The more bile you have, the more elimination of cholesterol
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=174s)** — that you have. So in reality you develop gallstones because you don't have enough bile,
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=179s)** — okay? And all of those symptoms that I mentioned are really symptoms of a bile deficiency.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=186s)** — You have this gallbladder, right? It's not an extra organ that you're developing. You really
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=190s)** — need the gallbladder. The gallbladder has a very, very important purpose of storing and
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=198s)** — concentrating the bile salts. Why do you need concentrated bile? Because that concentrated bile
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=205s)** — is then released by the gallbladder into your small intestine to help you break down the fats.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=211s)** — If you just put bile into the small intestine without it being concentrated, you're not
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=216s)** — nearly going to have the effect that you should to help extract the fat soluble nutrients
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=220s)** — like vitamin A, D, E, K1, K2, omega-3 fatty acids, things like that. And so this bile helps break
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=227s)** — down this fat to a certain degree, but then the pancreas releases its enzyme called lipase to help
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=232s)** — break it down even smaller. And so when you don't have a gallbladder because they removed
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=237s)** — it, now you just have a tube from your liver to the small intestine, okay? You don't get
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=242s)** — any more concentration of the bile. And then you may have a hard time digesting fats and
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=246s)** — absorbing these fat soluble nutrients. Now, on a rare occasion, when they do the surgery,
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=252s)** — they might have made this duct maybe a little bit too big. And now we get too much bile coming
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=259s)** — into the small intestine. And the biggest symptom for that would be diarrhea. And also not
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=264s)** — enough bile is constipation. And there's another term I want to tell you about. It's
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=269s)** — called choleostasis. And I think that's a really common problem where you don't have a
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=274s)** — it's kind of like sludge. So you have bio sludge. It's a lot of cholesterol, but you don't have
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=279s)** — enough bile. And it kind of just sits there and it causes a lot of pain. And you do the
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=284s)** — ultrasound, you don't see any stone. There's also a syndrome that occurs after you have
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=289s)** — your gallbladder removed, that you now have complications too. And I want to bring that up
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=294s)** — because sometimes people will downplay that. But it can occur up to 40% of the time. And
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=301s)** — you take a wild guess what the biggest symptom is after surgery. Choleostasis, this bile sludge.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=309s)** — And that can give you the same symptoms as you had before you had the surgery with a gallstone.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=314s)** — Because they removed the stone, but they didn't remove the cause of the stone,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=319s)** — which is the lack of bile problem. Other risk factors for getting gallstones would be
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=325s)** — pregnancy, because you have this spike in estrogen. Too much estrogen can put you
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=329s)** — at risk for a gallstone. Also taking birth control pills, which is more estrogen.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=335s)** — Obesity and type 2 diabetes simply because you're going to have higher levels of insulin,
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=341s)** — which also can aggravate and increase the risk of gallstones. Liver disease can put you at
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=347s)** — risk. Why? Because the liver actually makes bile salts. Okay. And the more problems you
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=353s)** — have with the liver, whether it's fatty or liver disease, whatever, the less bile you're
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=357s)** — making. Constipation, I already talked about that. That can put you at risk. Actually,
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=362s)** — just the bile deficiency can cause the symptom of constipation. And also if you're low in
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=367s)** — folate, okay, this can be more of a genetic problem or just you don't consume any vegetables,
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=372s)** — so you don't get any folate. Folate helps the conversion of cholesterol to bile salts. So
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=380s)** — people that are on a statin drug don't have the cholesterol to make bile. And a lot of
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=387s)** — symptoms. Also, if you're on PPIs, these are in acids, that can create a big problem
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=393s)** — or an increased risk of gallstones simply because you need that acid in your stomach
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=399s)** — to trigger the liver to release bile salts. A high carb diet, which increases insulin,
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=406s)** — can also put you at risk. And even a low fat diet can put you at risk. Why? Because one of
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=411s)** — triggers for the release of bile is fat. And if you don't have enough, like let's say you're
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=418s)** — a vegetarian or a vegan, that could put you at risk for getting gallstones. So what is the
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=424s)** — solution? What do we do? The first solution is to take purified bile salts with some
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=429s)** — probiotic. One with meals and you take one an empty stomach twice a day. Okay, sometimes
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=434s)** — you need more, but you're going to take this over a period of time. What this is going to do,
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=438s)** — to help dissolve the stone. Because we have a situation where we have a super concentrated
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=443s)** — amount of cholesterol, but not enough bile salt. So we need more bile salt. Realize that your
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=448s)** — gut makes bile too. So we really need to also support the microbiome with some probiotic.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=456s)** — And I think a really good way to do that would be to consume like sauerkraut or kimchi or even
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=462s)** — kefir. Eating more salad would be beneficial. The fiber in the salad helps to bind with
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=467s)** — the cholesterol. So that's one cool thing. Also, you're going to get folate, which will help you
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=471s)** — make this conversion to make more bile. I would also manually massage underneath your right rib
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=478s)** — cage and the left rib cage to help maybe push some of the sludge through. And many times
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=484s)** — that will give you a tremendous amount of relief. And the last thing to do is to decrease
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=488s)** — your insulin. Okay, because insulin can increase your risk. And you do that two ways.
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=493s)** — Intermittent fasting and number two, going on a low carb diet. And if you're not familiar
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=497s)** — with that, I put a link down below. But I think the most important thing for you to watch now,
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=504s)** — because you're watching this video and you're concerned about gallstones,
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=507s)** — is to learn how to do this manual flushing. Okay, this massage in your gallbladder. And I
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTsJmiIx9M&t=512s)** — put that video up right here. Check it out.
