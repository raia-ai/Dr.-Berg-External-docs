- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=0s)** — We are going to talk about the seven signs that your body is begging you for more vitamin D,
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=5s)** — as well as why daily dosing of vitamin D is crucial.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=10s)** — Number one, if you have high blood pressure. One of the biggest causes of high blood pressure is
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=15s)** — low vitamin D. Number two, lowered mood as in depression. Could be anxiety as well.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=22s)** — Number three, inflammation. Whether it's from autoimmune or arthritis or anything,
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=27s)** — if you have inflammation, you probably need more vitamin D. Number four, your immune system is weak
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=32s)** — and you are getting sick too frequently. Number five, if your sleep cycle is off. You wake up
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=39s)** — and you're not refreshed or you have sleep apnea, vitamin D will help you get into that delta
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=44s)** — wave deep sleep so you wake up feeling refreshed. Number six, almost every type of skin problem
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=51s)** — is related to a vitamin D deficiency. And seven, lower back pain as well as muscle pain. If your
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=58s)** — muscles are tight, sore and painful, take more vitamin D. It will get rid of that. Now let me
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=63s)** — just share some wild information with you. When they test you and they're looking at
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=69s)** — this inactive version, they're actually looking at mainly two types of vitamin D. They're
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=82s)** — the free vitamin D. Over 99% of all this inactive vitamin D they test in your blood
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=89s)** — is this type right here, bounded. And then you have a tiny bit that's free. The half-life for
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=94s)** — this bound vitamin D is like two to three weeks. And the half-life for the free is 24 hours.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=101s)** — All right, so what does that all mean? It means that when they test you and you see a certain
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=105s)** — amount, they're not differentiating between the bound vitamin D or the free vitamin D.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=114s)** — You can assume that you have enough vitamin D to support your skin, your muscles, your organs,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=119s)** — your immune system. But unless you're taking vitamin D or getting sun every 24 hours,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=127s)** — there's a likelihood that you're probably going to be somewhat deficient. Especially with all
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=133s)** — the other barriers on top of this vitamin D situation, including obesity, insulin resistance,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=139s)** — diabetes, being inside and not getting exposure, not getting enough vitamin D from the food. The
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=144s)** — more we age, the less we can convert vitamin D on our skin. And the recommendations for
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=150s)** — vitamin D are a joke. You need higher amounts. So this is why I recommend daily vitamin D.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=156s)** — If your doctor says, oh my gosh, that's a toxic effect, just ask them, how much vitamin
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=162s)** — D can I get from being out in the sun for about a half hour to 40 minutes? Because the answer is
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=168s)** — 20,000 I use. So 10,000 is not an abnormal amount. Now the last and very important part
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=177s)** — I want to mention about vitamin D. In order for vitamin D to go through those different
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=180s)** — biochemical reactions, it needs help from certain nutrients like magnesium, like zinc,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=188s)** — like vitamin K2, like boron. And that way you can maximize your ability to have vitamin D work
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=196s)** — without any type of deficiencies. And if you want more information on that and also how to
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7_UePVK3Q&t=201s)** — prevent any type of toxicity, you should watch this video right here.
