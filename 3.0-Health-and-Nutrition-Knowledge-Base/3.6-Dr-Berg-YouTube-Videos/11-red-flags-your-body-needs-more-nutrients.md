- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=4s)** — I put together a kit, a very comprehensive kit, that covers all of the different aspects
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=10s)** — of the adrenal type. And I want to talk about them.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=13s)** — Number one, sleep aid. Now this is something I take every night before I go to sleep.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=18s)** — You take it literally about 15 minutes before you go to sleep and you will just go right
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=22s)** — to sleep, wake up feeling refreshed, you won't feel groggy. It doesn't have the
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=29s)** — feel kind of foggy. It has certain things to help relax the internal stress so you
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=36s)** — can turn off fast and then sleep sound through the night. I have adapted this formula over

- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=51s)** — you take during the day. The sensation that you know you need this is if you have
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=56s)** — this internal stress, this tension that you need to relax. And if you know people

- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=66s)** — tablet and wait like three minutes. They are just going to feel very chilled out.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=70s)** — So it is really good to take during the day. You take like three, spread it out.

- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=81s)** — And the next one is trace minerals. I use a plant-based trace minerals which are
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=86s)** — fifteen thousand times smaller than regular minerals. But these help the
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D35xgIVtQM&t=92s)** — proteins work in your body. So with adrenal you have a lot of breakdown of
