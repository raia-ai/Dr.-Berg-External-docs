- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=0s)** — I like to talk about the risks of taking 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3. Sounds like a lot, 10,000,
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=7s)** — but is it really that much? Just so you know very briefly, IUs stand for International Units. Okay?
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=15s)** — So 10,000 international units of vitamin D is equivalent to not even one milligram,
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=22s)** — not even a half a milligram. It's actually one quarter of one milligram, .25 milligrams,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=30s)** — which is 250 micrograms. Okay? That's 10,000 international units of vitamin D3.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=37s)** — So is there a risk of taking that much? I think there's a bigger risk of not taking that much.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=43s)** — Let me explain. I recently found some information that literally blew me away, and I think it's
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=52s)** — just a little foundation of what we're talking about. The great majority of us are deficient
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=58s)** — in vitamin D. Now, I guess the conflicting information is that the RDAs of vitamin D
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=65s)** — is between 600 to 800 international units. Okay? And now we're talking about taking 10,000.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=73s)** — It sounds like a huge gap, but what you have to realize is that 600 to 800 IUs
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=79s)** — is based on old research relating to preventing osteoporosis, bone loss. It's not updated and
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=87s)** — correlated with all the new information related to the benefit of vitamin D for your immune
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=93s)** — system. What's even more wild is that vitamin D is not really even a vitamin. It's a hormone,
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=99s)** — and it acts very similar to cortisol as an anti-inflammatory, but without the side effects.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=103s)** — Every cell in your body has receptors for vitamin D. The functions of vitamin D are very,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=109s)** — very vast, but I want this video to focus mainly on why you need as a maintenance dose,
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=116s)** — 10,000 IUs. It really has to do with the barriers of absorption. You have a lot of
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=122s)** — things that are stopping vitamin D from going into your body, right? You have the sun, like
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=129s)** — sun exposure to their skin. They don't go outside as much. And if they're going outside
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=135s)** — with a shirt on and just getting exposure to their face, you're not going to even get close
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=140s)** — to the amount that you need. And also it's almost impossible to get enough vitamin D from
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=144s)** — the foods that we eat. Even if you eat fatty fish and cod liver oil and egg yolks, which
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=151s)** — are higher in vitamin D3, you're still not going to reach the levels that you need. Then
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=156s)** — you have people that are overweight. The more fat right beneath your skin, the harder it is for
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=164s)** — the sun to penetrate to create the vitamin D necessary. Then we have metabolic syndrome.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=169s)** — If you have diabetes or you have insulin resistance, vitamin D doesn't go in that well.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=175s)** — The older you are, the skin becomes thicker and it's harder to get your vitamin D. The
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=180s)** — more pigment you have, in other words, the darker your skin, the less vitamin D absorption
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=184s)** — you're going to have. And also the more problem you have with the gallbladder or the liver. Let's
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=189s)** — see if a fatty liver, the less absorption of vitamin D you're going to have. Because you
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=194s)** — need bile to help you absorb vitamin D from the food, as well as from a supplement because
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=198s)** — it's a fat soluble vitamin. And the more kidney problems you have, the less vitamin D
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=203s)** — you're going to have as well. So the way it works is you have these precursor or inactive
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=209s)** — vitamin D compounds that have to be converted to the active form of vitamin D. And they go
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=216s)** — through various steps, but there's two primary steps. One through the liver and one through
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=221s)** — the kidney to eventually get this active form of vitamin D3. It then has to be absorbed
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=226s)** — in your receptors. And those receptors are called vitamin D receptors. And if you have an
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=232s)** — like a viral infection, these viruses can trick your body by downgrading the receptors
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=239s)** — and preventing you from absorbing vitamin D3. So that's another barrier. If you're
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=245s)** — immune compromised or you have an immune system problem, the amount of vitamin D
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=249s)** — you're going to need is going to have to be a lot more to penetrate that resistance that
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=254s)** — the virus has strategically created for you. And when they do a blood test for vitamin D,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=260s)** — they're not testing the active form of vitamin D. They're testing the inactive
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=264s)** — form. And the reason why is because if they tested the active form, there's a lot of
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=270s)** — problems with that. Number one being that it has a very short half-life. Like I think it's
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=277s)** — four to six hours compared to two to three weeks for the inactive vitamin D3. And also the
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=290s)** — apparently have a lot of inactive vitamin D sitting there waiting to be converted. And also
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=296s)** — when you're deficient in the inactive version of vitamin D3, your body will then compensate
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=303s)** — and make more of the active vitamin D3. So if you tested the active vitamin D3 and it shows
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=310s)** — up normal, it doesn't really give you a lot of information. So this is why the inactive
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=316s)** — form is tested. But this next thing is going to blow your way. Okay. And this relates to your
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=323s)** — genes. I've been recently involved in a lot of research in genetics looking at what's called
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=332s)** — polymorphisms, which are alterations in certain genes that make you more susceptible
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=337s)** — to having problems with certain illnesses. But there's three polymorphisms that are routinely
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=344s)** — tested when you do your DNA test that I need to talk about because in the last, I would say,
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=351s)** — several months, I tested their DNA. They're mainly friends and family members. And I wanted
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=356s)** — to just get experience in this topic. And testing real people is a very good way to do that.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=362s)** — And check this out. This is just related to vitamin D. Out of the 21 people that I tested,
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=367s)** — 100% of them had at least one problem with vitamin D absorption. In other words, they had
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=374s)** — at least one genetic issue with their vitamin D, which is another barrier that I don't think
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=381s)** — is really acknowledged or even known. It could be the next 21 people I test don't have a
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=387s)** — problem with vitamin D. But with this small sample, there was 21 out of 21 people that had
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=392s)** — relating to vitamin D genes. In the first gene, it was called the CYP2R1. And out of all the 21
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=401s)** — people tested, 90% of them had a problem with this gene. And 38% of that group had a major
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=409s)** — problem with that polymorphism or mutation. And this gene is one of the two steps in the
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=416s)** — conversion from the inactive to the active and occurs in the liver. So in other words, if you
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=421s)** — have a problem with this gene, you're going to have a problem in converting the inactive form to
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=426s)** — the active form. Now let's talk about the other two genes. These other two genes were involved
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=431s)** — with transportation, like binding to a protein and transporting this vitamin D throughout your
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=437s)** — circulation. And out of all 21, in the first transporter gene, there was like 61% of the
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=445s)** — people that had a problem with that one. And then with that second transporter, there was
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=449s)** — 76% of the people that had a problem with that gene. So a lot of people didn't have a problem
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=455s)** — just with one gene. It was all three genes. So if we take this genetic alteration on top of
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=462s)** — all these other barriers, now we can see 10,000 IUs is not going to be toxic at all. In
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=470s)** — fact, it's going to be necessary to penetrate some of these big barriers that people are up
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=476s)** — That being said, how much vitamin D does create a toxicity effect? Well, that's still in debate,
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=483s)** — but based on all the research that I looked at, it would take hundreds of thousands of
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=489s)** — international units of vitamin D for months before it created a toxic effect. And that toxic
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=495s)** — effect is primarily hypercalcemia. And the risk of that problem is mainly kidney stones.
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=501s)** — So just as a precautionary step, if you're drinking two and a half liters of fluid a day,
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=506s)** — that decreases your risk big time of getting a kidney stone because you're going to keep the
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=510s)** — urine diluted. And then on top of that, if you take some of the supporting nutrients that
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=515s)** — allows vitamin D absorption, as well as the function of it, and also factors that protect
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=521s)** — you against hypercalcemia like vitamin K2, magnesium, B6, zinc, then that puts you even in
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=529s)** — And one last point about getting your blood tested with vitamin D. To date, there's still no
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=537s)** — consensus from the entire medical community on what those values should be. But most doctors
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=544s)** — is between 150 to 200 nanograms per milliliter. But again, when they do a blood test,
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=550s)** — they're looking at the inactive vitamin D. They're not looking at the active vitamin D.
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=555s)** — They're also not looking at what happens in the vitamin D receptor absorption into your cells.
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=561s)** — We're not looking at that level. If you also have a genetic problem in the vitamin D
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=566s)** — receptor, or you have an infection, some virus that's downgrading that vitamin D receptor,
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=572s)** — or even you have an autoimmune disease that has this downgraded vitamin D receptor,
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=577s)** — you might need much, much higher levels of vitamin D3 than 10,000 I use. Now, I created
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=583s)** — another really interesting video on the toxicity effect. And I looked at more of the percentages
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=589s)** — based on all the research out there of what could happen, what cofactors you need to take.
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11qN7GUuoy0&t=595s)** — If you haven't seen this video, you should check it out. It's really interesting.
