- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=0s)** — Now this video might get me banned or in trouble.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=3s)** — And I think you're going to question everything that you thought you knew about modern medicine.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=9s)** — I'm going to share just the highlights from this book right here, which I'll put a link down below.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=14s)** — There's a lot more details on this topic, but I'm going to cover the highlights.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=17s)** — Typically the RDAs for vitamin D are about 600 IUs.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=22s)** — They stand for International Units.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=24s)** — It's an arbitrary number, which basically a group of people in a committee voted on it.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=28s)** — And I really believe it was originally designed to scare people from taking too much of certain things.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=35s)** — But at the end of this video, I'm going to share with you who really started this whole thing and it will all make sense.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=40s)** — And if we just take a look at 600 IUs, International Units, how many milligrams is that?
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=46s)** — That's just a little bit more than one-tenth of one milligram.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=51s)** — That's a very small amount.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=52s)** — For the last 100 years, vitamin D has been a very controversial topic because I believe it helps so many people in so many ways.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=62s)** — We use sunbathing called heliotherapy back in the early 1900s.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=67s)** — This is before vaccines and this is before antibiotics.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=71s)** — And they would heal up their TB and their asthma, osteoporosis, tooth decay, psoriasis, mood issues, diabetes,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=81s)** — heart disease and even cancer.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=84s)** — And then what happened? We're told to stay out of the sun.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=87s)** — Here, take your sunblock. Vitamin D can be toxic.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=90s)** — What you need to know is 600 IUs is basically standing out in the sun in the summer 1.8 minutes.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=98s)** — Less than two minutes.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=99s)** — 10,000 IUs is standing out in the summer sun for about 30 minutes.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=105s)** — But in the last 100 years, this number 600 IUs has been pushed on people.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=110s)** — That's what you need. And because of some vitamin D toxicity issues,
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=114s)** — the government commissioned the University of Illinois Chicago to do a study on the toxicity of vitamin D.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=121s)** — The previous reports of vitamin D toxicity was related to improper production techniques.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=127s)** — So it really wasn't about the vitamin D itself.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=129s)** — It was in the manufacturing of vitamin D.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=131s)** — Now this study that they did went on for nine years, involved hundreds of doctors,
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=138s)** — 773 patients, 63 dogs.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=141s)** — Take a wild guess what type of dosage they used for vitamin D.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=144s)** — 200,000 to 1 million IUs.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=148s)** — Well guess what? They did not find any toxicity.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=152s)** — Now what you have to realize is that vitamin D3 is very special in that it's an immune modulator.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=158s)** — The Institute of Health is kind of a governing body,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=161s)** — and they're the ones who recommend 600 IUs of vitamin D3.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=164s)** — Here's the problem with those numbers and their evaluation.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=168s)** — There was two other organizations who reevaluated their data and found that they made some mistakes.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=175s)** — What was 600 IUs should have been 8,895 IUs.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=182s)** — Let's take a look at one of the major vitamin D researchers.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=185s)** — And he invited me to talk.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=187s)** — I got up and presented this data to, you know, these were the top vitamin D researchers in the world, all assembled there.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=194s)** — It was vicious. The attacks of how vitamin D doesn't do this.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=199s)** — How could you say this? I said I'm just presenting the data that we have assembled.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=204s)** — You're walking on guys careers that have spent their whole career doing this stuff.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=208s)** — They never conceived that this could be true.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=211s)** — You know, you don't know what you're doing.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=213s)** — Well, the government wasted a whole lot of money here for you to conduct these worthless studies.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=217s)** — The same type of thing happened to the professor who discovered folates.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=222s)** — Was chastised and not believed for decades.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=226s)** — But how could a nutrient have this kind of an effect?
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=229s)** — Of course, he turned out to be true, but it was the same sort of attacks.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=233s)** — Take a look at these interesting graphs.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=235s)** — Zero is right in the center of these graphs by the equator where you have the most sun and the most vitamin D.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=243s)** — So MS, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and diabetes lowest risk at the equator.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=250s)** — So this just gives an interesting correlation between latitude and certain diseases.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=257s)** — Now I want to share some additional things.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=258s)** — In 1900 to 1910, a lot of people got rickets.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=263s)** — It was common back then. 1918 to 1920, they use sun therapy and cod liver oil for rickets.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=272s)** — 1922, they discovered vitamin D.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=275s)** — 1946, the number 400 I use was recommended to prevent rickets.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=280s)** — 1950 to 1970, despite the increased awareness that vitamin D goes beyond just bone health,
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=288s)** — they kept the numbers for vitamin D at 400 I use.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=292s)** — 1980, there were more benefits for vitamin D for your immune system, for other chronic diseases,
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=296s)** — but they kept the same 400 I use for vitamin D3.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=301s)** — Then in 1997, the Institute of Medicine updated the RDAs.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=306s)** — They wanted to introduce something new called the adequate intake
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=309s)** — because they said the RDAs weren't very scientific.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=312s)** — So take a guess what they recommended at this point.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=316s)** — 200 I use for adults, 400 I use if you're 51 to 70, and 600 I use for over 70.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=323s)** — Finally in 2010, they went up to 600 I use for adults under 70 and 800 if you're over 70.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=332s)** — Now this whole time they're recommending 400 I use.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=334s)** — There are three medications that were used on a regular basis and take a wild guess what they were.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=342s)** — Vitamin D at 50,000 I use.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=345s)** — So you can take it if it's prescribed through a medication,
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=349s)** — but everyone else, you know, take 400 because of the toxicity of anything more.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=355s)** — I mean, think about in the 80s, this huge campaign to stay out of the sun, take sunblock.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=360s)** — The sun will kill you. You're going to get skin cancer.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=362s)** — Melanoma, which is the number one skin cancer, it develops in areas where you're not exposed to sun.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=368s)** — Personally, my viewpoint on melanomas, it's really a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=372s)** — Vitamin D is needed in 2700 different genes.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=377s)** — There are so many barriers for absorbing vitamin D3.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=380s)** — You have the difficulty getting vitamin D in food.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=382s)** — You have this thing called vitamin D resistance, which a lot of people have genetically,
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=387s)** — where the vitamin D receptor won't receive the vitamin D.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=390s)** — The darker the skin, the less absorption of vitamin D you get.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=394s)** — The older the skin, the less vitamin D you create.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=397s)** — The more you weigh, the less vitamin D you're going to absorb because vitamin D gets diluted into the fat cells.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=402s)** — But it's very obvious to me that big pharma, modern medicine,
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=406s)** — want you to take extremely low doses of vitamin D, if any vitamin D at all.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=413s)** — So this is just scratching the surface.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=414s)** — If you want the complete data on this history, check out this book right here.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_C3RIudfFw&t=418s)** — I'll put a link down below in the description.
