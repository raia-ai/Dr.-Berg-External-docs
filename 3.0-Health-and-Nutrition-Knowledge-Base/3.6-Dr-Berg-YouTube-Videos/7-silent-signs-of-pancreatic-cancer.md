- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=0s)** — And there's something I recently learned that it's almost embarrassing to say that I should have
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=5s)** — known this long ago. And it relates to GROSS, which stands for Generally Recognized as Safe.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=12s)** — And this designation goes along with certain chemicals that are put out in our environment
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=18s)** — in food, implying that it probably went through a lot of different safety studies, right? And
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=23s)** — it's regulated by the FDA. But apparently what I just learned about this is that the FDA allows
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=29s)** — companies to self-certify their poisons... I'm sorry, chemicals as being safe. And I mean,
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=37s)** — think about this. We have like 10,000 chemicals in our food supply and 99% of them have not
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=45s)** — really been reviewed for safety. And so this leads me to a new definition that I want to
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=51s)** — share with you. It's called a loophole. And relating to this topic, a loophole is something
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=56s)** — that a company can use to avoid certain restrictions. And that's exactly what this
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=64s)** — GROSS is. It's a big fat loophole that companies use to imply that their chemicals are safe,
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=70s)** — despite other testing done by other facilities, which is quite fascinating because
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=75s)** — many chemicals that are allowed in the U.S. are not allowed in Europe. Yeah, and today
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=80s)** — I'm just going to talk about six of these poisons. I mean, chemicals that are generally
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=87s)** — considered as safe. I like how they use the word generally, so they don't have to be that
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=92s)** — specific about it. So the first one on the list is nitrates. Nitrates are those things that
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=97s)** — they use to preserve meat. It's in like bacon, processed meats, things like that, to keep
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=105s)** — that meat from turning gray. So it keeps it red. It increases the shelf life, but it does
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=111s)** — increase the risk of cancer. It also could be in your drinking water. Now, here's the thing.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=117s)** — When you see on the label that the nitrates are coming from something like celery juice,
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=122s)** — that's a completely different type of nitrate. I'm talking about things like sodium nitrate,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=127s)** — things like that. Alright, number two, BHA. Okay, this is a preservative. This increases
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=133s)** — shelf life, but it's a known endocrine disruptor. It messes with your endocrine
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=138s)** — system and hormones. It's also been linked to cancer. It's considered our carcinogen.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=144s)** — And if you ask someone about what causes cancer, you know, people will say certain
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=150s)** — toxins and chemicals in the environment. There's a whole classification of these toxins called
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=155s)** — carcinogens, right? And the accumulation of carcinogens could definitely increase your
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=160s)** — risk of getting a cancer. So that's BHA. There's another one called BHT, which is
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=166s)** — another preservative. And you see it in a lot of different foods. It too is an endocrine
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=170s)** — disruptor. It messes with your kidney, your liver, and it also increases cancer risk.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=177s)** — So you just really need to read the labels and watch for these chemicals. And there's a
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=182s)** — lot of them too. Alright, next one on the list is called potassium bromide. This is a dough
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=188s)** — conditioner. I'm talking about the dough that you would use to make bread. It's used in a
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=193s)** — lot of flour products and it gives that product a certain texture, potassium bromide. Now potassium
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=199s)** — bromide is a carcinogen, okay? It causes cancer and it can definitely mess with the
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=204s)** — thyroid and it can inhibit iodine. And so the antidote or remedy or thing that you
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=210s)** — can use to counter bromide in the body is iodine, whether it's in sea kelp or when you
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=223s)** — Now this is a flavor stabilizer. Usually in beverages, especially citrus sodas,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=231s)** — things like that, and it keeps the flavoring kind of constant so it doesn't fluctuate.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=236s)** — But it's also a flame retardant. It affects your nervous system, which can affect your
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=242s)** — brain, which can affect your memory. This chemical can also interfere with iodine.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=247s)** — And so iodine would be like the antidote or something to kind of counter the effects of
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=251s)** — But of course the best option is to just avoid the food that they put these chemicals in.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=256s)** — Now the last one, titanium dioxide. This heavy metal gives candy kind of a smooth texture.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=266s)** — Kind of like that surface area that's really shiny and bright because it also gives a
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=271s)** — white color. And if you actually have different colorings, as in food colorings,
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=276s)** — it can make those colors pop really bright and brilliant. And unfortunately a lot of these
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=281s)** — chemicals are in the foods that kids eat. And at that age they just don't have the judgment
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=285s)** — to be able to determine these chemicals yet. But it's up to the parent's judgment
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=290s)** — if the parent is aware of these chemicals. There's one little tiny problem with this
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=295s)** — heavy metal. It causes DNA breaks, damage with your chromosomes, which can link to an increased
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=303s)** — risk of cancer. And the kind of the antidote or remedy for that is a volcanic ash mineral
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=308s)** — called zeolite, as well as infrared sauna. But I think the best thing to do is just to avoid it.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=315s)** — But typically we have in our bodies, especially in the liver, the ability to get rid of a lot
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=322s)** — of these poisons if we don't consume too many. However, when I'm doing this recent deep dive
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=328s)** — in DNA, I found quite a few people who have a problem with their detoxification genes. And so
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=336s)** — they have a lessened ability to get rid of these poisons, which means they need to avoid them
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=341s)** — as well as consume foods that help the detoxification process like
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=345s)** — cruciferous vegetables, which have certain phytonutrients that help stimulate this
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Uro77TvvQ&t=350s)** — detoxification process. Now I have a really good video describing that phenomena right here. Check it out.
