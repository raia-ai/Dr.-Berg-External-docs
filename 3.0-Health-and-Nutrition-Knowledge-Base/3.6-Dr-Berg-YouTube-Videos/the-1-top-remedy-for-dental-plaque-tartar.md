- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=0s)** — I'm going to show you the best remedy to get rid of
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=4s)** — tartar as well as to prevent tartar from coming back. What is tartar? Well, tartar is this
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=10s)** — calcified,
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=11s)** — pale yellow,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=13s)** — hard growth on the inside of your teeth that tends to get into your gums. It can create
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=18s)** — gingivitis. It can create bad breath. And if we take a look at what tartar really is, it's actually a collection, a colony of bacteria
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=28s)** — that is in a slime that then has calcified. And that's just a way that microorganisms
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=34s)** — survive in nature. Over 95% of all bacteria in nature
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=39s)** — survive as biofilms. Now, if you ever walked through the woods and you saw a little stream
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=44s)** — and you reached down and picked up one of the rocks in the stream, on the outer part of it
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=49s)** — you're going to feel it's kind of slimy.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=52s)** — That's biofilms.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=53s)** — I mean, even in your pool, if people don't use enough chlorine or other things, natural things like
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=59s)** — certain salts and things, then you'll get this slimy thing at the bottom of your pool. And these biofilms are not just bacteria.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=67s)** — There's a bit of fungus as well, yeast and candida. And they
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=72s)** — are not on keto. In other words, they like carbs. They ferment carbohydrates in your mouth.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=79s)** — And then what happens is they release lactic acid.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=83s)** — And so they make your mouth really acid. And that acid has the potential to leach away your calcium and break down your
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=91s)** — teeth, giving you cavities and all sorts of wear and tear in your teeth. Now, I'm going to show you one of the best
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=97s)** — anti-tartar
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=98s)** — toothpaste that you can make at home, very inexpensively. And it's very effective and very natural.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=104s)** — You know, when they looked at ancient Egyptian, like mummy tombs, the teeth were pretty messed up.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=109s)** — They had a lot of dental problems.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=112s)** — And it probably came from all the beer and the bread that they consumed,
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=116s)** — which is the perfect food to feed these bacteria in the mouth.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=119s)** — But they used a type of toothpaste composed of ox hoof
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=123s)** — ashes, burnt egg shells, and volcanic ash.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=127s)** — That's a great mixture. That probably creates some abrasiveness, right?
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=131s)** — And then the ancient Greeks used a different type of toothpaste made out of burnt shells.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=136s)** — And they used powdered talc, which is kind of like a combination between magnesium and
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=141s)** — silica. And then they mixed a little salt and honey in there. And then the Romans used crushed bones,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=147s)** — oyster shells, and charcoal with a little bark. So the problem I see with that formula,
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=153s)** — it's a bit abrasive and it can wear down your teeth. So this formula is very non-abrasive.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=159s)** — You have clove oil, peppermint oil, or cinnamon oil,
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=164s)** — or turmeric powder. So in a little container
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=167s)** — you can just put like three drops of one of these or like a little pinch of turmeric if you want to use that.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=172s)** — Now the next thing you're going to put in this little container, okay, is hydrogen peroxide.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=177s)** — All you need is like a fourth of a teaspoon, which is about 1.25 milliliters.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=182s)** — Now the interesting thing about hydrogen peroxide is that your body makes it to
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=187s)** — actually kill bacteria and microbes.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=190s)** — So you're not giving something to the body doesn't know what it is. And hydrogen peroxide is a very potent antimicrobial
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=196s)** — that inhibits biofilms. The next thing you're going to use is baking soda.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=202s)** — Now, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, wow, that's pretty gritty. It's going to be invasive.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=207s)** — But in actuality, it has a very low abrasivity, which is basically the ability to be abrasive.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=213s)** — There's this metric or this scale called the relative dentin.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=218s)** — It's kind of like a layer right underneath the outside of the tooth. So it's relative dentin
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=224s)** — abrasivity. Basically, it gives you kind of a rating system to know how much something could, you know,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=231s)** — break down part of your teeth. And baking soda is a seven, okay? A seven.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=236s)** — Compare that to regular toothpaste, which is between 70 and 250.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=242s)** — So baking soda is actually not going to grind down your teeth. And baking soda is sodium
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=249s)** — bicarbonate. So it adds alkalinity. It takes these acids and actually helps neutralize them.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=255s)** — And our body makes sodium bicarbonate. It's a way that the body can buffer some of these acids.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=263s)** — So both hydrogen peroxide and sodium bicarbonate are
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=267s)** — something that our body makes. So with baking soda, you're going to use a fourth of a teaspoon.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=272s)** — Then you're going to add either raw honey or
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=276s)** — manuka honey. But just add a fourth of a teaspoon. Not very much.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=280s)** — But the key is it has to be raw or else you're just basically killing off
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=284s)** — the things that are anti-biofilm. Now raw honey also has hydrogen peroxide in it.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=291s)** — Now manuka honey doesn't have the hydrogen peroxide, but it has some other things
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=295s)** — that regular raw honey doesn't have a large amount of to address this problem.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=300s)** — Then you can add a half a cup of water, which is 118 milliliters
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=305s)** — of water. And then you're going to mix everything out real nice.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=308s)** — So then you're going to brush your teeth with it with a soft bristle toothbrush. This way we can preserve the teeth,
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=315s)** — kill off this film that is developing into
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=318s)** — tartar. And you want to do that twice a day. As a side note, vitamin K2 has some interesting research that may
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=325s)** — also inhibit the formation of tartar.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=329s)** — It's kind of a mixed review, but I have heard reports from quite a few people that swear by it.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=335s)** — They notice that the inside of their teeth are nice and smooth when they take
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=340s)** — this K2, which has a purpose of directing calcium
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=343s)** — into the bone and out of the soft tissues. Now since vitamin K2 is so new and so important,
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPjZvNA74ds&t=350s)** — you should probably learn more about it. I put a video up right here. Check it out.
