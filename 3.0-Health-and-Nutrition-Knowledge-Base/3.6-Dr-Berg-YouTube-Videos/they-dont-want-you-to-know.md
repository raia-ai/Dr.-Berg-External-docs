- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=0s)** — The number one vitamin deficiency in high blood pressure, aka hypertension, is what we're going
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=6s)** — to talk about. This is not just for high blood pressure, it's for anything related to the
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=10s)** — arteries. Black in the arteries, calcium in the arteries, this information is so vitally important.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=17s)** — Your doctors will not tell you this because they're simply not trained. Despite massive
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=23s)** — If you have high blood pressure, the doctors should always check for vitamin D levels. Vitamin D is
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=32s)** — the most important vitamin for the inside of the artery, yet it's completely ignored. A person
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=38s)** — instead is put on medication. I mean, if you look up the actual cause of hypertension,
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=43s)** — 90% of it is called essential. What does that mean? It means unknown cause. I'm going to be
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=48s)** — tell you that that essential hypertension is a vitamin D deficiency. If we take a look at an
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=54s)** — artery, you have a very thin single cell layer of tissue called the endothelial layer. That is
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=63s)** — inside the artery, just constantly reacting with things that are in the artery itself.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=68s)** — Whether there's too much sugar or junk food or whatever, that little layer is going to
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=74s)** — do something. And if a person is deficient in vitamin D, they lose massive protection against
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=81s)** — that little layer of cells. And now the person is very susceptible to the start of many problems.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=88s)** — You have to realize that vitamin D is one of the most potent natural substances in existence.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=93s)** — There was one study that I found that evaluated over a thousand different compounds to see which
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=100s)** — most potently affected this endothelial layer. And guess what? It was vitamin D. And you're about
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=107s)** — to learn why vitamin D is so important. Number one, it's a potent anti-inflammatory. Number
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=112s)** — two, it's a potent antioxidant. And number three, it directly increases something called
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=117s)** — nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is something that keeps the arteries in a state of vasodilation
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=124s)** — relaxation. When you don't have enough nitric oxide, the artery starts getting tight and your
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=130s)** — blood pressure starts going up. Just think about nitric oxide as something that lowers
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=135s)** — blood pressure. When that little layer, the endothelial layer becomes dysfunctional,
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=140s)** — you don't produce nitric oxide anymore. The whole thing is controlled by vitamin D.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=145s)** — Vitamin D helps increase calcium absorption in the intestine by 20 times so it can support
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=154s)** — your bone health. Calcium has another very important purpose in the body of providing
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=160s)** — communication signaling between cells. This is why the body has all these different systems
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=165s)** — to keep calcium very regulated and keep it in the blood at all costs. Our bodies are not
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=175s)** — that controls calcium in the bone or in the blood. What happens if you don't have enough
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=180s)** — vitamin D to calcium in the blood? You might absorb some of the calcium from the food you
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=185s)** — eat, but not very much. When you have low vitamin D, you're going to also have low
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=191s)** — amounts of calcium and your body does not like that. It has a plan B. I got to bring
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=196s)** — up something new that a lot of people don't know about, but it's something called the
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=201s)** — parathyroid. There's four glands that are on your thyroid gland. The parathyroid hormone
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=207s)** — is a backup to vitamin D. If you're low in vitamin D, the parathyroid hormone is going to
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=214s)** — increase and grab calcium from your bone and put it into your blood to make sure that there's
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=223s)** — always calcium in the blood. What happens if you're chronically low in vitamin D, like the
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=229s)** — majority of the population, you're going to get a dysfunction of the parathyroid hormone. It's
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=235s)** — robbing a lot of calcium from that bone and creating osteoporosis, which is a lack of
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=241s)** — certain minerals in the bone. And now the bone is going to be very porous. It's going to
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=245s)** — have holes in it. But at the same time, you're going to have a lot of calcification
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=250s)** — in the arteries, in the soft tissue, all because the parathyroid hormone is working like
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=256s)** — in excess. They call this a secondary hyperparathyroidism, excess secretion
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=261s)** — of the parathyroid hormone by the parathyroid gland in response to low calcium. Your joints
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=266s)** — are filling up with this calcium. Other causes can stem from a vitamin D deficiency. Low
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=272s)** — vitamin D causes low calcium and causes the parathyroid to co-haywire. Why am I making such
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=286s)** — a big mistake? I'm not going to give too much vitamin D to a person. It's going to develop
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=290s)** — a toxic effect. This is another confusion. First of all, I haven't found any type of clinical
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=296s)** — data to show that's true. I've talked to Professor Bruce Hollis, who is a pioneer in
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=301s)** — vitamin D research, and he told me that he's never seen a case where vitamin D in higher
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=306s)** — amounts caused this toxic hypercalcemia effect. But a chronic vitamin D deficiency
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=314s)** — causing this calcium problem is way, way more common, and that's what we should be focusing
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=319s)** — on. Plus, if we add this additional data of adding vitamin K2 to help mobilize calcium
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=324s)** — from the arteries, and more importantly, adding magnesium when we take vitamin D3,
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=329s)** — because magnesium is literally the regulator of this excess calcium. Magnesium alone prevents
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=335s)** — so many cardiovascular problems. Magnesium removes excessive calcium to allow the normal
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=340s)** — contraction relaxation, and your arteries have contractile tissue, and they're able to relax as
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=346s)** — well. I want to circle back to this vitamin K2 for a second, because vitamin K2 actually helps
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=350s)** — remove calcium from the arteries as well. It then removes the calcium and puts it deep into
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=356s)** — the teeth, into the bone. It makes the bones really, really solid. But you better take
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=360s)** — vitamin D with K2. Why? If someone is chronically low in vitamin D3, what's going to
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=367s)** — is the arteries are going to be more susceptible to inflammation, plaque hardening of the arteries.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=373s)** — And I'm not even talking about the arteries of the heart. I'm talking about peripheral arteries
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=376s)** — through the entire body. That's one of the biggest risks for amputation of the lower part
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=382s)** — of your extremities, your feet. Vitamin D can potently protect the arteries. They'll help
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=387s)** — the arteries become less inflamed. They will support the vascular cells for nitric oxide.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=392s)** — Combined with vitamin K2 and magnesium, you can really keep that calcium from developing in
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=397s)** — the wrong place, the soft tissues. If I personally had high blood pressure, I would be taking
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=401s)** — 30,000 IUs of vitamin D3 every single day. The best source of vitamin D is the sun, but of
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=407s)** — course it's hard to get enough sun. In the summer, when you can get sun, make sure a good
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=412s)** — part of your body is exposed to sun. About 40 minutes in the sun will give you 20,000 IUs
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=417s)** — which is not a significant amount if you look at the toxicity of just that sun exposure.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=423s)** — Because even some lifeguards that are exposed to the sun, they'll get about 100,000 IUs of
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=429s)** — vitamin D3 in a given day. The whole point is to get as much sun as you can without
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=433s)** — burning yourself. Get slightly pink and then come out of the sun so you can develop a tan. But
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=439s)** — that regular exposure is really really important, especially in preventing high blood pressure. If
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=443s)** — you already have high blood pressure, you should try the combination of vitamin D3 with the
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=447s)** — magnesium and K2 and just see what happens. Check with your doctor before implementing anything
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=452s)** — that I have to say because I'm not trying to bypass your doctor. I'm just trying to educate
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzFQzm0H40&t=456s)** — you on some additional things that I think are really really important. Thanks for watching.
