- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to talk about how to slow down the aging process. If you want to look younger,
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=5s)** — live longer, and have fewer diseases, then this video is for you. Now, I know I don't look 75
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=12s)** — years old, okay? And it's probably because I'm not 75 years old. I'm 59. But what I'm going to
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=17s)** — show you is based on a huge deep dive into this longevity topic. I'm not sure if you've ever
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=23s)** — heard of the mitochondria before, but the mitochondria is the energy factory. And so you're
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=29s)** — as your mitochondria is functioning and in good shape. So without getting into too much biochemistry,
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=37s)** — if you've taken a biology class, you may remember there's something called the Krebs
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=41s)** — cycle. And the Krebs cycle is basically a little circle. It's like an assembly line. And there's
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=48s)** — various steps and different chemicals involved in this little assembly line. And it starts
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=53s)** — with food that enters this Krebs cycle, and it ends with energy. And I think the biggest
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=58s)** — thing that was missing when I studied the Krebs cycle was something called cofactors. This Krebs
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=63s)** — cycle requires nutrients to go from A to B to C. Because if you're missing a certain nutrient,
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=70s)** — instead, it becomes bottlenecked and things back up. And you're not going to be able to
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=76s)** — make the energy. And so by this additional understanding of nutrients related to the
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=89s)** — nutrients. And the reason I'm even bringing this up is that I'm leading up to this one molecule.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=95s)** — It's called NAD. And NAD is involved in extracting energy from food. NAD is a very
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=103s)** — vital molecule in helping you live long. And the energy that it's going to make is called ATP.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=110s)** — It's also involved in preventing muscle loss, especially if someone has cancer. It's also
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=117s)** — involved in protecting you against radiation. And here's the big thing you need to know. As we
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=123s)** — age, the NAD decreases. Researchers have found that there's this thing that has eaten up NAD.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=132s)** — And this thing is called CD38. In mice studies, when they're born without this CD38,
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=141s)** — they live a long life. They don't have a lot of health problems. So there are five compounds
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=147s)** — that you can start getting from your diet that can then keep your NAD very high. So you can
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=153s)** — live a long life. So let's start with the first one. It's called epigenin. Parsley has
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=158s)** — the most epigenin of all plants that I could find. The next one on the list is thyme. Then
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=164s)** — oregano, basil, celery. These are various spices and herbs that you can use on your food on a
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=171s)** — regular basis. Number two, antho xanthan. And you can get this in the following foods.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=179s)** — Blueberries. Anything blue, purple, or even red has high amounts of this particular natural
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=187s)** — chemical. Elderberry is really also good for your immune system. Then we have the concord
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=193s)** — purple potatoes are loaded with this. The next one is called curcumin. And you might already
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=199s)** — know that one is in the turmeric spice. And then the next phytonutrient is called quercetin.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=205s)** — And the food that has the highest quercetin is the onion. Most of the quercetin is in the
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=211s)** — outer part of the onion. So when you peel the onion, don't peel it too deep. And then
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=217s)** — we have the apple skin. Of course apples are high in sugar, right? Well, if you just ate the skin
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=223s)** — of the apple, you would get a lot of quercetin. And then the last one on the list is called
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=227s)** — methylene blue. Now, this is not a plant. This is a synthetic dye. This was actually the first
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=234s)** — drug that was ever invented. They used to use it for many different things. But it seems
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=239s)** — a good inhibitor of this CD38, which can then increase the NAD and increase your longevity.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=247s)** — If you haven't seen my video on methylene blue, this might tie this whole topic together for
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rra9FJ2lURI&t=252s)** — you. So for that information, you should watch this video next right here.
