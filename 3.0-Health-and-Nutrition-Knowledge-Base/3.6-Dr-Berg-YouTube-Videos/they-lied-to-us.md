- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=0s)** — Welcome back everyone. I have a special guest today to talk about some real interesting
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=7s)** — effects of doing infrared on gout. And his name is Dr. Ben Pearl. He's a podiatrist and he's
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=18s)** — been in the field for quite some time. So welcome to the interview, doc.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=22s)** — Oh, thank you for having me. I've been following you for a while and
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=26s)** — I really like the varied approaches that you take, you know, give people some armamentarium that
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=32s)** — they can do right from the home in their local drug store or health food store.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=37s)** — That's great because you do the same thing. I think you kind of think outside the box.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=43s)** — I've watched some of your videos, so that's why I wanted to interview and just kind of pick
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=46s)** — your brain. Today I want to kind of focus on this gout. A lot of people have gout and they
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=53s)** — don't like to take the medication because it could potentially create some wild side effects.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=58s)** — So I know you have various therapies in your clinic. If we could just focus in on this
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=65s)** — red light, red light therapy, and there's different types of red light that we'll talk
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=69s)** — about on gout. And so thanks for being on and I won't take too much of your time, but
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=75s)** — a couple questions to get right off the bat. So it's a little confusing for people when
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=82s)** — they talk about red light because you have different spectrums or different wavelengths.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=87s)** — You have the far and the near infrared. Can you just simply explain like is there much
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=94s)** — significance with therapy or does these different types of frequencies create different effects?
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=100s)** — Right. So I think when we're talking about what most people talk about in terms of infrared
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=106s)** — and LEDs, these are very safe units that have nice musculoskeletal benefits, nice clearing out
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=115s)** — of joint synovitis and tendonitis. And, you know, we're talking specifically about gout
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=122s)** — can even do things that help cell permeability, which as you know, is the exchange of ions
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=128s)** — and uric acid is essentially something that the body is over producing. So it can help with that
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=135s)** — process of cellular exchange and the cell getting rid of the waste byproducts.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=144s)** — As far as the spectrums, which you mentioned, the lower levels aren't as strong, so they're
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=149s)** — going to require more time or more dosage time to apply them. But there's nothing wrong
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=155s)** — with that. You talk about the frequencies closer to visible light, like the I guess it's the
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=161s)** — near or the far. Oh, not yet. It's the near, right? Near infrared. Right. Right. Right.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=167s)** — As we get into things like laser at different amplitudes, then we have accompanying heat.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=174s)** — And then those obviously are more clinic based situations, although there are, as you know,
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=181s)** — and on the market now, home laser units that the FDA has approved for home
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=188s)** — distribution. And the best way to do that is really to go online and do your due diligence
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=194s)** — to make sure that they're legitimate devices. But those are getting into a different spectrum
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=202s)** — of light and they have their own effects. And what some people do is they'll do
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=210s)** — combinations of therapy where they'll do some at different frequencies. And that has the effect
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=217s)** — of the body not getting used to one particular frequency. And even within a frequency treatment,
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=224s)** — when you have the ability to change cycles as some protocols where you can change cycles,
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=230s)** — you'll get different lights operating at different intervals that can have also
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=237s)** — potentiating effects on healing the body. So when you do infrared on a patient that comes
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=244s)** — with gout, typically, are you going to use a specific protocol? Are you going to do a
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=252s)** — mixed frequency? Because I know some red light therapies have multiple frequencies.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=258s)** — Can you give me more specifics on maybe what someone could do at home related to the red light?
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=265s)** — Right. I would make sure that they just look at it as a bona fide infrared unit that has
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=272s)** — you know, looking at the reviews and making sure that the company is not just giving you
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=282s)** — something that is the reporting to be at, you know, a certain standard. And I think that would
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=287s)** — be the best way to vet that out. You know, as an example, this one does not have the one
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=293s)** — that I have and that I'm using in conjunction with another modality, does not have multiple
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=300s)** — frequencies associated with this. This will put out one frequency. What we can do is we can adapt
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=306s)** — you know, the time on this one. And I'm all about trying to do mixed modalities of energy
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=315s)** — so that, you know, you're having the body get different effects that can work in tandem
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=320s)** — and in synergy. Totally. So if someone let's say someone has gout and they apply this
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=327s)** — therapy to their toe, how long would an average treatment be like 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 15 minutes?
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=335s)** — What would you do? I think if you're applying the home-based units, you want to go about
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=340s)** — 20 minutes at a minimum. And it would even be good to do that at a twice a day interval.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=347s)** — So you could do it morning and night. And as you know, the nadir points of the metabolism,
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=354s)** — you know, typically in, you know, early in the morning and later in the night, you know,
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=359s)** — as our body is kind of coming to a more lower relaxed phase, are those are the points where
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=365s)** — these attacks generally are more prevalent, and the blood flow isn't as vigorous, etc. So
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=371s)** — those are good timing points that you could apply the therapies. And, you know, it also
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=376s)** — happens to coincide with the work schedule for most people. Totally. And then tell us a
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=384s)** — little bit about the results. What kind of results? Does it happen right away? Does it take
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=388s)** — some time? Multiple treatments, a week or so or two weeks? What's your thought on that?
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=392s)** — I'm glad you mentioned that because you need to be doing especially with a gout flare,
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=398s)** — some of the things that you mentioned on your videos to affect the uric acid production
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=404s)** — and excretion in tandem with I would not want somebody to think that this is a standalone.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=411s)** — This is part of a puzzle. And this is one piece of the puzzle where we're using energy
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=416s)** — in complement with other things that we're doing with diet modification,
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=422s)** — obviously clearing out with hydration so that the body can resolve the gouty attack. Now for
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=428s)** — longer term maintenance, that's something where you might have to just cut down to like a once
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=433s)** — a day maintenance treatment as opposed to doing two treatments a day. As you know, one of the
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=440s)** — culprits to gout is this fructose. And so many people don't connect how much fructose they
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=446s)** — actually consume and they think, oh yeah, I'm eating natural fruits. Well, that has some
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=450s)** — fructose in it and so does normal table sugar has fructose. And from an evolutionary
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=457s)** — standpoint, we didn't consume nearly the amount of fructose that we do now. And fructose
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=465s)** — really turns into uric acid at a pretty high rate. But even the evolution just fruits,
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=472s)** — right? In general, if you take a look at where certain fruits came from, the amount of
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=478s)** — sweetness was like way, way, way lower. We have high breaded these fruits to the point
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=483s)** — where we're just like flooding the body with so much fructose. So that's one of the things
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=486s)** — that I found if someone just cuts that out, huge, huge changes in the intensity of the
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=493s)** — fructose. So we definitely need to take in consideration the diet part and certain things
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=498s)** — that really spike it. And even if you're on the ketogenic diet, xylitol apparently
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=504s)** — can increase what's called pseudogout, which could be oxalates and things like that can
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=509s)** — irritate that toe. So, you know, I'm on keto diet. I'm not eating any fructose. I'm
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=514s)** — not eating any sugar, but you're doing tons of xylitol. That can be like a hidden thing.
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=518s)** — But that's why I wanted to bring you on because there's two things that I want to talk about,
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=523s)** — which is infrared and also electromagnetic type therapy to use that. Can you just touch on that
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=530s)** — therapy as well? Because that can also be something that like a home therapy as well.
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=535s)** — Yeah. Yeah. So I'm going to show you first a larger base unit that I have here. And I
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=541s)** — like this so much, Dr. Bird, that I have one of these units at home. What it basically is,
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=548s)** — is a copper wiring that produces a magnetic field and it's electrocharged. And unlike,
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=556s)** — you remember the craze with magnets in your shoes, they just weren't high enough Gauss to
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=563s)** — affect the bigger changes that we would be looking for cellular exchange. What is the
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=570s)** — word Gauss? What is that? Is that just a level of magnetic energy or what is Gauss?
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=577s)** — So Gauss is the power, the electric power charge. So for instance, some of the mats that are
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=585s)** — widely available now, and I won't get into names and advertising, but they're widely
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=591s)** — available. They've been sort of the rage for health and wellness. They'll have something like
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=596s)** — 4,000 Gauss. And those are great for health and wellness. This particular unit goes up to 4,000
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=602s)** — Gauss. Now you do... Yeah. Yeah. So you have to be making sure, for instance, that if I had
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=611s)** — this near my chest, that I don't have a pacemaker because it would interrupt. It would
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=616s)** — interrupt the signal on my cell phone if I put this right up to it. And you'll see the,
- **[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=621s)** — jacket lines, et cetera. So this is a larger thing. These are closed loops. So they are
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=628s)** — purported to be safer than what's emitting from the cell phone in terms of the energy. And
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=635s)** — that's, I think, a relevant point. As with anything, you have to do your due diligence
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=641s)** — if you're looking for a home unit. And there are sites that review some of the home units that
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=646s)** — for several hundred dollars, as opposed to several thousand dollars, you can find what it is,
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=653s)** — is a smaller ring unit. So instead of, you know, have being housed in a big plastic,
- **[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=658s)** — it might just have a smaller loop about the size of a quarter or a half dollar. And it's a
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=665s)** — very flexible copper wire ring. And there might be a couple of these that you place on the,
- **[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=672s)** — let's say, a whisk out on your big toe, for instance. And then the box, you know,
- **[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=676s)** — the power charge unit will be a much smaller, it'll be, you know, this probably about the
- **[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=681s)** — size of a little bit like half a loaf of bread kind of energy unit, as opposed to a much larger
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=689s)** — microwave size unit. I like the ones that generate more in the, let's say, several hundred
- **[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=697s)** — gauss than the ones that are .6 gauss. Not that there's anything wrong, even at those lower
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=703s)** — levels, they've been shown up regulation of bone production, even at .6 gauss, because the
- **[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=710s)** — frequency or the Hertz is also important. That's the other key to the puzzle. So the more
- **[11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=716s)** — sophisticated the unit, the more options on frequency. My unit, for instance, goes up to
- **[12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=724s)** — 60 hertz on the frequency. And some of the smaller units, they just won't have as many
- **[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=730s)** — options on the frequency cycles. So on a gout situation, what kind of frequency or Hertz
- **[12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=735s)** — would you use? I go all the way up sometimes as high as the 60%, which is about 2500 gauss.
- **[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=744s)** — And I would do the frequency cycle going from about seven to about 28 hertz. And what it does
- **[12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=752s)** — is it will go through an oscillation of that particular frequency for, let's say, two minutes,
- **[12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=759s)** — and then jump to the next frequency and so on, and then just go in a loop.
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=764s)** — And I think you mentioned when we talked before that you can actually
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=767s)** — see some difference in swelling just by one treatment, right? And swelling comes down,
- **[12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=772s)** — in some cases, I've been able to measure the circumference of the body part, and it'll decrease,
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=778s)** — let's say, in the ankle three quarters of a sonometer. And I do these measurements and I've
- **[13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=783s)** — done them on some of my videos to just document different cases so that people have
- **[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=789s)** — an idea of the range of things to expect, because every patient responds a little bit
- **[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=794s)** — differently, as you know. That's great. So, okay, so electromagnetic fields, and then also,
- **[13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=800s)** — which I've talked about the dangers, but if it's controlled like that
- **[13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=804s)** — in a ring, I think it's going to be a lot better. Have you ever heard of using like
- **[13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=811s)** — methylene blue with the light to potentiate the effect? I like that idea because of the
- **[13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=818s)** — color spectrum, so it's something that I'll have to research. You know, so this stuff is
- **[13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=825s)** — all related. I mean, it comes down to as elemental as like thinking about photosynthesis
- **[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=831s)** — and how light affects plant energy production. It's the same basic core idea with a different
- **[14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=841s)** — application. So anything color related is going to have some effect on energy.
- **[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=849s)** — Yeah, it's some fascinating new data, and even they're doing it right now,
- **[14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=853s)** — research on cancer where they're taking the methylene blue, which is kind of like
- **[14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=857s)** — has some really interesting properties to mitochondria, and then
- **[14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=862s)** — throwing a photo because the infrared can penetrate the body. So it penetrates in the
- **[14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=867s)** — body, and it potentiates the treatment in the mitochondria, and it works on that
- **[14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=872s)** — electron chain, which is kind of just like the conveyor belt of electrons. And so,
- **[14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=878s)** — since most problems are mitochondria related, then you're going right at the heart of this
- **[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=886s)** — thing. So that's something that would be interesting to experiment on just adding
- **[14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=890s)** — methylene blue because methylene blue tends to go where you need it. And it has some
- **[14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=895s)** — fascinating effects of mopping up electrons if you have a leaky mitochondria. And of course,
- **[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=901s)** — in the big toe, what I would be interested in, we'll just have to experiment on that,
- **[15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=907s)** — take methylene blue, do these other therapies, and see what creates the biggest effect.
- **[15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=914s)** — Because we're trying to deal with at the bottom level the cell. We're trying to improve the
- **[15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=919s)** — cell function. We're trying to get rid of stuff. We're trying to make sure electrons
- **[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=924s)** — aren't creating so many free radicals. This goes hand in hand with that in terms of ion
- **[15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=933s)** — exchange. Our cells basically are sodium potassium pumps. So people think back to
- **[15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=939s)** — chemistry, physiology, oh, I remember something about sodium and potassium with the nerve and
- **[15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=944s)** — vaguely about the cell. But every cell, whether it be a bone cell, smooth muscle cell,
- **[15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=950s)** — has sodium potassium exchange. So our bodies are basically like batteries that respond to
- **[15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=956s)** — energy. And what you mentioned with color, if we can, just like our car, a dark upholstery
- **[16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=963s)** — and we're absorbing more light. So there's definitely implications there. And I'll be
- **[16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=967s)** — curious to see once I do the literature search, how that might be able to be
- **[16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=972s)** — incorporated into protocols. Yeah. So I've been doing some videos recently on
- **[16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=981s)** — looking at oxygen and CO2, looking at different pHs inside and outside the cell. How can you
- **[16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=986s)** — you know, because in order to have a battery, to have this energy built up in the cell,
- **[16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=993s)** — to keep it normal, you need these gradients, these differences, these two different,
- **[16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=999s)** — either two different electrolytes, two different pHs, two different
- **[16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1005s)** — gradients of concentrations. So you create this flow. And when we're dealing with
- **[16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1010s)** — crystals building up, waste building up, lactic acid building up, there seems to be some damage
- **[16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1017s)** — in the membrane. So I think the wave of the future is going to be going away from drugs and
- **[17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1022s)** — more to these natural things. So, but it's brand new. It's like people are just now
- **[17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1027s)** — starting to look at it, but there's not going to be a lot probably of research because
- **[17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1031s)** — there's not a lot of money in doing some of these simple things, unfortunately, especially
- **[17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1035s)** — with methyl, methylene blue, because you can't patent it anymore. It's like,
- **[17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1039s)** — it's one of the first drugs, but it seems to do some wonders on restoring the oxygen
- **[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1046s)** — into the mitochondria, mopping up the excess electrons. So you can then heal the mitochondria.
- **[17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1054s)** — Yeah, so anyway, I just wanted to throw that out there.
- **[17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1057s)** — To your point about research too, I was speaking with a company that is doing an IRB
- **[17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1066s)** — on cellular healing for wound healing for like diabetics with electromagnetic in particular.
- **[17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1073s)** — So you're talking IRB like infrared?
- **[17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1075s)** — Oh, for an investigation review board where they're submitting to the NIH.
- **[18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1081s)** — And just so people understand, why isn't there more research on this? Well, to do an IRB,
- **[18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1086s)** — first you have to have funding. You have to have an application to the government,
- **[18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1090s)** — several thousand dollars. So you really have to believe in your product to
- **[18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1094s)** — even start that. The second layer is with the pandemic, things have gotten pushed to the back
- **[18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1101s)** — seat. So if there's a cancer research grant, that is going to be at probably a higher
- **[18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1108s)** — priority, even though you would think, oh my gosh, diabetic ulcers, it's a pandemic of
- **[18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1113s)** — diabetes in our Tela-2 cities nation with obesity and so forth. But nonetheless, those are
- **[18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1121s)** — very slow to get to the review board to even take action to start the study. So that's why
- **[18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1130s)** — even on things like you said, where, oh, there's not as much money, even on when you
- **[18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1135s)** — have a company backing to, we'd like to move this science forward, it is just glacial speed
- **[19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1143s)** — sometimes. I know. It's crazy. But anyway, I really appreciate your time. I know you
- **[19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1150s)** — have a patient sitting there. But listen, I'm going to put your website link down below in
- **[19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1157s)** — the description so people can get ahold of you for maybe other related issues as well
- **[19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1163s)** — that they might have. But thank you, Doc, for spending the time and I appreciate it. And
- **[19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1168s)** — we'll follow up with some some additional information in the future. I really enjoyed the
- **[19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1174s)** — interview, Dr. Berg. Thanks so much for having me on your program. I continue to learn from
- **[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1180s)** — you. I love the idea of collaboration and exchange of ideas. And I'm telling you folks,
- **[19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1188s)** — Dr. McCoy's little thing that he was doing in the old Star Trek, that is a reality now.
- **[19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1196s)** — We just, as you mentioned, we want to dial in on the protocol so that we have
- **[20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1201s)** — as much science backing. Each study that we do, each patient though, becomes a part of
- **[20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QePHCO8T8Q&t=1206s)** — discussion where you have anecdotal to build up the body of knowledge. Awesome. Great. Thanks much.
