- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the earliest sign of a magnesium deficiency that you do not want to ignore.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=5s)** — There are 22 signs, but the earliest sign will shock you, so stay tuned for that.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=10s)** — Now check this out. Most of your magnesium is right inside the bone. 60%. 20% is in your muscles.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=18s)** — 19% is in the soft tissues in the different organs. And only 1% of all the magnesium
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=25s)** — is in your blood. Magnesium is the most overlooked nutrient by doctors. You cannot
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=32s)** — determine a magnesium deficiency by a blood test because half of the magnesium in your bones,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=39s)** — 30%, can be used as a reservoir for extra magnesium for your blood. So you can be very
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=47s)** — magnesium deficient in your body, yet have normal magnesium on your blood test. There's
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=52s)** — no single quick way to determine your magnesium status in an accurate way. But first let's talk
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=60s)** — about how someone would be deficient. Let's first go through the things that can deplete
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=65s)** — you of magnesium. Of course you have the sugar, the refined carbohydrates, you have the alcohol,
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=71s)** — you have cirrhosis of the liver. You also have even in the farms they put this fertilizer
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=77s)** — NPK stands for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. They don't put magnesium back in the soil. And then
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=84s)** — if we eat the plants that are low in magnesium, we become deficient in magnesium. Malabsorption is
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=90s)** — another common reason that means you have inflammation in your gut, which prevents you
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=94s)** — from absorbing magnesium and other nutrients. If you're on a diuretic, if you are on a PPI,
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=100s)** — that's something that helps with acid reflux. If you had gastric bypass, if you're low in
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=106s)** — MND, you're not going to be able to absorb magnesium. If you have inflammation, you won't be
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=111s)** — able to absorb magnesium. And there are also magnesium deficiency diseases like diabetes, high
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=119s)** — blood pressure, arthritis, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease. Because there's a huge
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=126s)** — association between all of those diseases and low magnesium. But now let's talk about the diet.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=131s)** — What foods are high in magnesium? Well, if you guess leafy greens, you are correct. These are
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=139s)** — vegetables. Anytime you see green, think chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is the blood of the plant.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=145s)** — So if you want more magnesium, think more green. And I'm not talking about pistachio
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=150s)** — ice cream or lime green jello. If you do certain vegetables like spinach that have high
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=157s)** — oxalates, that can reduce the absorption. So in other words, some of the foods that do have
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=164s)** — magnesium like almonds, chocolate also have oxalates, which can block the absorption.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=172s)** — Now people will tell you that grains are high in magnesium, right? Well, grains also have
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=177s)** — phytates, which block magnesium. Those are whole grains. But you say, well, I'm eating
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=181s)** — refined grains. Well, when they refine the grain, or any food, they get rid of most of the
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=188s)** — magnesium. So grains are not a good source of magnesium, whether they're whole grains or
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=192s)** — refined grains. Also, when you boil food, you end up leaching out some of the magnesium.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=198s)** — Roughly the RDAs for the recommended amount of magnesium is between like 300 and 400,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=204s)** — maybe a little bit more. There's some data that shows that ancient man needed a lot more,
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=208s)** — double that. And so most people don't even meet the minimum amounts that we need to prevent
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=214s)** — a magnesium deficiency. And this is why between 48 and 90% of the population is deficient in
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=221s)** — magnesium. Also realize you can get magnesium from various meats, chicken, especially pork.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=228s)** — You can even get it from red meat and even cheeses, especially Parmesan cheese and
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=235s)** — shellfish. So now let me go through some of the body clues that might indicate that you're low
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=241s)** — in magnesium. And then I'll get to the first earliest sign, because the earlier you know you
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=247s)** — have a deficiency, the better. Okay, anxiety, insomnia, depression, migraine headaches,
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=254s)** — restless leg syndrome, muscle cramps, fatigue, Tourette's, oxidative cholesterol,
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=261s)** — high homocysteine levels, high blood pressure, calcification in the arteries, arrhythmias, risk
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=268s)** — for getting a stroke, metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovarian syndrome, it's PCOS,
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=273s)** — risk for kidney stones, higher levels of calcium in the blood, inflammation, nystigmas,
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=280s)** — where are your eyes going back and forth, and asthma. So you're probably kind of surprised
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=286s)** — how many different symptoms could occur if you're deficient in magnesium. But just realize
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=290s)** — if you have sufficient magnesium in your body, all 350 different enzymes can finally work,
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=297s)** — and the body can actually do its job. But now let's get to the number one earliest
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=301s)** — sign that you have a magnesium deficiency. Neuromuscular hyper excitability. Now what the
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=308s)** — heck does that mean? That's a fancy word for tetany, or twitching of your muscles. Whether
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=315s)** — you get it underneath your left eye, like a tch tch tch, or even on your arm like this,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=319s)** — starts to twitch like that. Any of those little twitching sensations are the earliest signs of
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=326s)** — a magnesium deficiency. You have to realize that your nerves require magnesium to work. And
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=333s)** — apparently when you're deficient in magnesium, the nerves become more excited. You get faster
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=340s)** — nerve impulses, not slower. And if you really want to know what's happening, we don't have
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=344s)** — magnesium to push the calcium out of the cell. So now we have this buildup of calcium inside
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=351s)** — the cell. It can't come out because we don't have enough magnesium. So we don't have the
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=355s)** — normal contraction relaxation. So with magnesium and calcium, we have this whole dynamic between
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=364s)** — nerve impulses and muscle contraction and relaxation. Now since I brought up
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=370s)** — these right here, it's called leafy greens. If you want to know how much you really need to
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9e99iRTCQ&t=376s)** — not only get your magnesium but your potassium, you should watch this video right here.
