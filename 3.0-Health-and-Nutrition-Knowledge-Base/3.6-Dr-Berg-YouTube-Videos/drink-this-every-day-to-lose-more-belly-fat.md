- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=0s)** — In this video, I'm going to show you the number one best tip for intermittent fasting to help lose your
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=6s)** — belly fat. Let me first explain the relationship between insulin and fat storage using different
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=12s)** — size batteries. This big battery represents your fat. This small tiny battery represents
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=19s)** — how much sugar you have in your liver that's stored. And an average skinny person is holding
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=25s)** — about 100,000 calories of fat with only 1700 calories of sugar storage. So an average thin
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=35s)** — person has 58 times more stored fat than sugar. So how do we transition from the sugar to the fat?
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=44s)** — Well, we have to lower insulin. So the intermittent fasting tips I'm going to show you
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=48s)** — have one goal to drop insulin so you make this transition from sugar burning to fat burning.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=53s)** — All right, let's start with the seventh tip. Okay, two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=59s)** — in a glass of water. Why? Because apple cider vinegar lowers your blood sugars and it lowers
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=68s)** — insulin. And insulin is the fat making hormone and the barrier to losing weight.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=72s)** — And this is so simple, everyone can do it. Just do one, two, or even three of these
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=77s)** — in a given day. All right, number six, you want to combine the low carb ketogenic diet with
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=84s)** — intermittent fasting. This is a one, two punch. Just by doing intermittent fasting, you're going
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=88s)** — to lower insulin. But if you add the low carb with it, you are going to be very, very
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=93s)** — successful. Plus going low carb is going to allow you to transition into fat burning a lot
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=98s)** — quicker versus just doing intermittent fasting by itself. And the way that you know you're in
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=102s)** — fat burning is you have no more appetite. Okay, so then it'll be easy to continue.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=108s)** — All right, tip number five. When we start out, we want to start out with a high fat diet.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=113s)** — But then as you transition and your appetite is a lot less, you know, several weeks into this,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=119s)** — then we'll start reducing the fat. This way we can tap into more of the ketones
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=123s)** — from our own body fat versus the fat that comes from our diet. All right, tip number
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=130s)** — four. We want to enhance your sleep, but to do that, we have to lower your stress.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=136s)** — And what's even better than exercise for stress and sleep is physical work around the
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=142s)** — house or physical work around your yard outside. Anything you do like that is a lot more
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=148s)** — productive. So you get something done. You're not just running on a treadmill and physical
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=153s)** — work does something else for your mind. It gets your attention off the stresses of life.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=158s)** — Tip number three is exercising in a fasting state versus exercising right after a meal.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=165s)** — There are actually 26 different studies that show that when you exercise in a fasting state,
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=170s)** — you'll burn more fat. So this is just compounding your results by adding another
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=175s)** — strategy that can speed things up for you. And as far as the type of exercise, I recommend
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=180s)** — doing a combination of higher intensity, but not more than twice a week because we don't want
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=185s)** — to overtrain. On the off days, you want to do long walks. All right, tip number two, you need to
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=191s)** — add more sea salt. And when you lose water weight, you're going to lose electrolytes,
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=194s)** — especially salt. And if you're low on salt and you're doing fasting, you're going to
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=199s)** — feel weaker. You're going to feel tired. A lot of people do not realize how much salt
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=203s)** — they actually need, especially when they're doing fasting. If you're low on salt, you're
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=207s)** — not going to sleep that good, especially in the first part of the sleep. So be more mindful
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=212s)** — of adding a little more salt to your food. All right, for the number one tip, this is the most
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=217s)** — important tip. Make note of this. You want to let your body determine the intermittent fasting
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=224s)** — pattern by hunger. So here's the rule. Don't eat unless you're hungry. This way will allow
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=232s)** — your body to transition to this at the right pace. Some people can fast longer than others.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=237s)** — Once your body gets in this amazing adaptive state and you're burning fat, you should be
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=242s)** — feeling great mentally and physically. If you don't, it means that you're not ready yet and
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=248s)** — you have to keep doing it and just take your time. All right, so now that you have all these
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=253s)** — tips, the next thing to learn is what to eat when you eat. And for that, I put this video
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg_xenOrKPg&t=259s)** — right here. Check it out.
