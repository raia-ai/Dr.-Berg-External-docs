- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=0s)** — I think most people would agree that sugar is not very good for you. And sugar is a
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=4s)** — type of carbohydrate. But there are other types of carbohydrate. You have fiber. That's
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=9s)** — a carbohydrate. When we think about fiber, we think about, okay, that's something that's
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=12s)** — fairly good for us, right? So we have good carbs and bad carbs. But what makes something
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=17s)** — good and what makes something bad? It has to do with what it does to your blood sugar.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=20s)** — Sugar absorbs very quickly and it will raise your blood sugar. And fiber doesn't. We're
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=26s)** — going to get into that a little bit. I'm excited to tell you that I have a brand
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=29s)** — new product that's released. It's my magnesium powder. And the reason why I like magnesium
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=33s)** — powder is because I don't like taking four to five capsules of magnesium versus just
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=39s)** — one scoop of this magnesium powder, mix it in water, slug it down. We just got this
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=43s)** — in. Last night I tried it. I slept like a baby. And the form of this is called
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=47s)** — magnesium glycinate. The glycinate part helps calm you down and it will actually
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=52s)** — enhance your sleep. And this form is absorbed at like 80% where other forms are absorbed
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=57s)** — There's three things about magnesium. Number one, most people are deficient. Number two,
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=62s)** — it's very difficult to test if you're deficient. And number three, magnesium is involved in
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=67s)** — thousands of different things on the body that go way beyond just decreasing stress,
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=71s)** — relaxation, and better sleep. And it's a one-time special offer. You'll get 20%
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=76s)** — off this product if you order it within the next five days. Simply click on the
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=80s)** — product icon in the left lower corner of this video and the discount will automatically
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=84s)** — be applied to your purchase. But more importantly, it's understanding what the
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=89s)** — third carbohydrate is. We have sugar, we have fiber, and then we have what's left. So I'm
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=95s)** — going to give you a hint. See if you can figure it out. We take a look at this product
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=98s)** — right here. This has a lot of carbohydrates. Not a lot of fiber. No sugar at all. Then
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=103s)** — we have chips. A lot of carbohydrate. Not very much fiber and basically no sugar. Here's one
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=109s)** — with high carbohydrates. A little bit of fiber but no sugar. You ever see these right
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=113s)** — here? A lot of carbohydrate. No sugar. Instant potatoes. A lot of carbohydrate. No sugar.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=118s)** — But here's the biggest hint. Corn starch. A lot of carbohydrate. In fact, it's all
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=123s)** — carbohydrate. Zero sugar. The carbohydrate we're talking about is starch. All of these foods
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=129s)** — right here are loaded with starch. Not in a whole form. It's not like potatoes or actual
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=136s)** — corn. We're dealing with something very highly processed. When you ultra process a
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=142s)** — starch, like corn for example, this starch no longer resembles the original food it
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=147s)** — came from. You could pretty much call this a synthetic starch. It's highly manipulated.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=153s)** — What you need to know about fiber and starch, both being similar, a chain of
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=157s)** — glucose molecules, is this. The bonds that connect these sugars together are
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=163s)** — very, very different. In fiber, they're extremely strong and this is why you can't break them down.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=168s)** — We as humans don't have the enzyme to break down certain fibers, therefore it doesn't get
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=174s)** — absorbed as sugar. And what's really fascinating about this is how certain starches affect your
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=180s)** — blood sugar. The first thing that's bad about starches, I'm talking about ultrafine starches,
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=187s)** — is that a lot of these have the potential to spike your blood sugars more than sugar. An
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=191s)** — average American consumes over 50% of their calories being ultra processed food calories.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=197s)** — We create this massive spike of blood sugar and we do it repetitively, day in and day out. At first,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=203s)** — our body can handle it to some degree. Maybe we're younger and we can burn off some of this
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=207s)** — energy, but as we get older, we don't burn off the energy. Some of it gets stored as stored sugar in our liver.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=213s)** — That's called glycogen. Then it gets converted over into fat. There's going to be a point where the fat cell itself
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=218s)** — is filled up. It had enough. It cannot absorb any more sugar. It becomes dysfunctional. And
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=225s)** — another term for this is called insulin resistance. Now the fat cell no longer has the ability
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=232s)** — to absorb any more fat. So then what happens? Where does this energy go? It goes inside the
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=237s)** — organs as liver fat, as fat inside the pancreas, and it goes in between the organs too as
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=245s)** — visceral fat. You may have this yourself. If you look down right now at your shoes and you can't see
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=249s)** — them because your belly's in the way, then you have visceral fat. Visceral fat means that your
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=253s)** — liver also has fat in it. There's no way you can have belly fat and not have any liver fat.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=259s)** — This goes on for a period of time until the insulin resistance gets so bad that now our
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=265s)** — insulin just doesn't work anymore. We can't remove the sugar out of the blood. We have now
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=274s)** — diabetes because of the amount of carbohydrates they're consuming. And I'm not talking about
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=279s)** — the carbohydrates from vegetables and things like that, even fruit. I'm talking about the
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=284s)** — ultra-process refined carbohydrates, specifically starch. People are so much against sugar,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=291s)** — but they don't really know this other hidden sugar in starch that's creating even more
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=297s)** — damage than sugar. And now you're starting to get an idea of what starch really is.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=302s)** — Don't worry, it gets worse. If you're going on the ketogenic diet, for example,
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=306s)** — the big thing is to keep your carbohydrates below 50 grams. Many times within the ketogenic diet,
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=313s)** — no one's really talking about what type of carbohydrates you should keep below 50 grams.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=319s)** — And I want to mention another point about starches. Starches are hidden sugars,
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=323s)** — but they're not classified as sugars. In fact, sometimes certain foods are advertised
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=327s)** — sugar-free when in fact they're just loaded with this hidden sugar. The other problem with these,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=333s)** — we'll call them synthetic starches, there's no protein, there's no fat, and there's definitely
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=337s)** — no fiber. Protein, fat, and fiber are the things that help buffer this spike in blood sugar.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=344s)** — And when we're consuming so much of this right here, we don't have any buffer for our
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=350s)** — blood sugar. And so what I'm trying to tell you is that you're depleting your body in a
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=357s)** — lot of ways. And the other thing that's also important for so many things, vitamin D would be
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=360s)** — depleted by consuming these types of foods. You're going to get a lot of inflammation, and
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=364s)** — the more inflammation you have, the less vitamin D can actually work in your cells. And vitamin
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=370s)** — B1 is like the spark plug that allows you to burn those carbohydrates. So now we can't make
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=376s)** — energy. You're going to get tired without B1, and you're going to deplete zinc. And the
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=380s)** — other thing that these, we'll call them synthetic starches, do is they tend to feed more of
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=384s)** — the pathogenic bad microbes, more than the good bacteria. Your good bacteria want fiber. They
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=392s)** — can live on sugar, but they prefer the fiber. But your pathogens love these starches. They
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=397s)** — can just thrive on them. They basically ferment them more than the good bacteria, because a
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=401s)** — lot of this food is broken down so fast and absorbed very high up in your small intestine.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=408s)** — It doesn't slowly break down and end up in a large colon too much, because it's highly
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=413s)** — processed. You end up breeding or growing the unfriendly microbes in the small intestine. And
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=420s)** — this is called SIBO, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. 50% of the population has that.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=425s)** — The breads, the pasta, the cereal, the crackers, the biscuits, the waffles, the
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=429s)** — pancakes contain synthetic starches, which are actually way worse than sugar. But they contain
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=433s)** — sometimes whole grains and they're considered heart healthy, which is a totally bunch of BS.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=437s)** — But now let's talk about something even more interesting. Why are they putting all of this
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=444s)** — cornstarch, the food starch, the modified cornstarch? What is the purpose of this in our food?
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=450s)** — This is going to shock you. The purpose of the modified food cornstarch in food is to
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=457s)** — thicken things. That's why they put it in there. Just to thicken things? Another reason is
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=462s)** — able to kind of like mix flavorings and sweeteners. It's like a delivery system.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=469s)** — When we get into maltodextrin, the purpose is basically a filler. You mean to tell me that
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=476s)** — they're putting something very, very dangerous, worse than sugar in our food just to be a
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=482s)** — filler? Something that they can actually make profit on that they can then classify
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=486s)** — as sugar-free because it's classified as a, and I'm not kidding, a complex carbohydrate.
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=491s)** — The last purpose of maltodextrin is an energy source. Put it in certain type of protein powders
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=497s)** — or the muscle mass powders where they're literally one serving is over a thousand
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=502s)** — calories and 80% of that is maltodextrin. I mean this is like creating such trauma,
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=508s)** — such overwhelming shock to your mitochondria and your cells so fast in your body when
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=513s)** — you consume this. I wanted to gain weight at some point, you know, and so I started doing
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=517s)** — those protein powders and it was filled with maltodextrin. It didn't work for me. All it made
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=523s)** — me do is want to go to sleep really quick. I just felt mentally groggy. The next time you're
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=527s)** — at the grocery store and you are tempted to buy these or these, which I used to love,
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=535s)** — or even these right here, realize that they have a tremendous amount of ultra-processed
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=542s)** — starch that's actually worse than real sugar. Now, since we're on the topic of maltodextrin,
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tboAto7so&t=545s)** — if you haven't seen this video, you should probably check it out. I put it up right here.
