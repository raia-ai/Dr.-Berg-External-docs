- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=0s)** — Let's talk about how to detoxify your lungs. What is the best way? Okay, we're talking about
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=4s)** — detoxifying pollution, the chemicals from smoking. And by the way, since you probably already know
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=10s)** — this, but there's 7,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke. 250 are harmful and 69 actually are
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=19s)** — carcinogenic. I mean there's even a radioactive element in smoking. You have ammonia, you have
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=26s)** — formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and even cadmium which is a heavy metal. And you have first-hand
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=31s)** — smoking and then you have second-hand smoking, right? But there's also third-hand smoking.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=36s)** — All the chemical particles that end up like on furniture, clothing that you come in contact
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=43s)** — with as well. And of course, the goal of you probably watching this is to reduce your risk of
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=48s)** — cancer and things like that. But there's another big problem that is associated with smoking
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=53s)** — and that is COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 12 million people in the United States
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=61s)** — have COPD. So I'm going to share some information on how to prevent that and if you have it,
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=67s)** — what to do to improve it. But smoking is not the only issue here. You have pollution in the
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=73s)** — air, you have cleaning supply chemicals, you have mold and mildew in your house. You even
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=79s)** — have something called radon gas that can actually affect your lungs. And then also if we compound
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=86s)** — that with pre-existing infections to the lung, it can lead to some major problems. And just so
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=92s)** — you know, lung cancer doesn't always come from smoking. It can be referred or they call it
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=99s)** — spread from other organs. And so if your lung has inflammation in it, it becomes a target
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=106s)** — for cancer because cancer tends to spread in areas of inflammation. So the key thing with
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=113s)** — this video is all about inflammation in the lung and how to reduce it because anytime you have
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=119s)** — inflammation you then get scar tissue, fibrosis, and then it gets to a point where it becomes
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=126s)** — irreversible. So when a toxin comes in contact with your lung tissue, it irritates it.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=132s)** — It's going to start creating inflammation. And then over time if there's a chronic exposure
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=138s)** — to that toxin, you start developing fibrosis. And you also at the same time get a lowered amount
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=144s)** — of your own antioxidants that are there to protect the lung. So you have this insult or
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=151s)** — free radical damage situation and a lowering of the protective mechanism of your own body's
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=156s)** — antioxidants goes down. But what a lot of people don't realize is that these chemicals
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=161s)** — that go into the lung go systemic. They don't stop at the lung and a lot of them end up in
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=168s)** — the liver. So the liver is at the heart of the detoxification system. So it's going to take
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=175s)** — those poisons that are in cigarettes or pollution and it's going to dismantle them hopefully.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=180s)** — And it does this through a series of enzyme interactions called phase one, phase two,
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=186s)** — phase three, detoxification enzymes. But it gets to a point where it becomes overloaded,
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=192s)** — where the liver cannot keep up with this, especially if it's a chronic exposure to these
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=197s)** — chemicals. The liver starts to develop inflammation. It can even develop fat from
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=204s)** — inflammation and then it leads to scar tissue. So as you filled up the lungs with chemicals
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=208s)** — and pollution, it can end up in the arteries and create a lot of heart problems. But I think the
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=213s)** — key note here is chronic exposure. Not exposure here and there that your liver can easily deal
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=221s)** — with this, but it's just a routine chronic exposure over a long period of time. That's
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=226s)** — where we have a problem. Let's jump right into what to do about it. There's some really
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=230s)** — interesting data on probably one of the best protective remedies for your lung,
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=239s)** — as well as the liver. And it's very different than what you're going to find when you do
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=243s)** — searches on detoxifying your lungs, because normally they're going to talk about herbs
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=250s)** — that help you stop coughing, might decrease swelling. But this other herb that I'm going to
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=256s)** — probably the most potent, not just because what it can do for your lung, but what it can do for
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=262s)** — your liver. And that herb is milk thistle. Milk thistle is one of the best antidotes
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=269s)** — to poison. So if you poison yourself from either a snake bite or a poisonous mushroom
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=275s)** — or toxins, or you're just taking medications, you should be taking milk thistle to protect
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=278s)** — the liver. Well, it just so happens that that same protection occurs in your lungs as well.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=284s)** — So if you have COPD or you're a smoker, or you're trying to repair your lungs,
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=290s)** — milk thistle is what you want to start taking. Because milk thistle is one of the best
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=294s)** — anti-inflammatories. It's the best protector against toxins. And it's a really good remedy
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=302s)** — if you have COPD and also any type of liver problem. Number two, tokatrinols. This is a
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=314s)** — vitamin E called the tocopherols. So tokatrinols are all about getting rid of free radical damage.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=322s)** — It's a very powerful antioxidant. It's a very powerful anti-inflammatory. And it's especially
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=328s)** — good to prevent fibrosis. So that stage where you go from inflammation to scar tissue. There's
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=336s)** — a lot of data that talks about tokatrinol helping prevent scar tissue in your arteries.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=341s)** — And then the liver, but also in your lungs. So tokatrinols are a number two remedy,
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=349s)** — especially to reduce inflammation. And number three, vitamin D. You want to take this probably
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=355s)** — in 20,000 I use. But vitamin D is a very powerful anti-inflammatory. And it's really good
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=362s)** — for COPD, any type of lung inflammation, as well as any autoimmune diseases. Now there are
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=370s)** — some interesting links between COPD and autoimmune. You may have antibodies against your own lung
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=377s)** — tissue if you have COPD. And this is something you'd have to have tested, but I want to bring
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=381s)** — it up because it is an issue. And if you have antibodies that are creating this inflammation
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=387s)** — in your lungs, this goes beyond just being exposed to toxins. This is your immune system
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=393s)** — that's misidentifying your lungs as a pathogen. Vitamin D is going to be very important.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=400s)** — In this additional remedy, so if you have antibodies against your own lung tissue,
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=404s)** — I'm going to recommend a product from another company that I'm not affiliated with. It's
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=408s)** — called Standard Process and the product is called Pneumotrophin PMG. You just take one
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=413s)** — of those before bed. And that can potentially act as a decoy. So these antibodies can then
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=419s)** — attack it and not your lungs, giving your lungs a chance to heal and regenerate. Now
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=430s)** — I think it would probably be appropriate to learn a little bit more about this
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kJQ4ufzXc&t=434s)** — milk thistle. And for that, you should check this video right here.
