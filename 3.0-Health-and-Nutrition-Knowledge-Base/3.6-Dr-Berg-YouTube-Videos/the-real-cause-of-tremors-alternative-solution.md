- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=0s)** — I have something very interesting to share with you regarding tremors. I found something that's
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=7s)** — quite fascinating. A lot of times tremors are misdiagnosed with Parkinson's when you don't
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=12s)** — necessarily have to have Parkinson's to have tremors. There's a type of tremor called a
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=16s)** — central tremor which is more progressive into a bigger problem over time and that's aggravated
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=23s)** — when you move versus a resting tremor which you're resting and you're having this tremor
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=29s)** — and I found the author of this patent was a neurologist. So obviously they knew something
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=36s)** — about tremors and so I studied it and I found something fascinating I want to share with you.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=42s)** — If you take high doses of vitamin B2 and high doses of coenzyme Q10, apparently you can improve
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=53s)** — the symptom greatly. But in this document I could not find the mechanism of why
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=60s)** — that would help someone. So that was just the start of my research in this area and I did a
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=65s)** — whole deep dive into it and I found something even more interesting. I found the mechanism of
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=70s)** — why these two nutrients would work and what amounts you would need to take to create
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=77s)** — a positive effect. There's a high correlation between mitochondrial diseases. Okay,
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=83s)** — mitochondria is the energy factor of the body and movement disorders. You see your nervous
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=89s)** — system requires a tremendous amount of energy so it requires very healthy mitochondria and when
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=97s)** — someone has neurodegenerative diseases or pathologies or anything related to that,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=104s)** — they're usually going to have a dysfunction in the mitochondria. And so the question is what
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=110s)** — does vitamin B2 and coenzyme Q10 have to do with the mitochondria? Well, a lot. The
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=118s)** — mitochondria is all about turning food into energy, ATP. ATP is like a battery. In the
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=125s)** — process of breaking down food into energy, there is a compound, like a carrier thing on
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=133s)** — the assembly line that extracts energy out of food. It extracts electrons. It helps carry
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=141s)** — electrons through this assembly line. And so both coenzyme Q10 and B2 are essential for the
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=150s)** — carrier of electrons. The name of the carrier of this is called FAD. What's interesting about
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=157s)** — FAD is like there's not a lot of people talking about FAD, but there are a lot of
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=162s)** — talking about NAD. You can even get that as a supplement and that helps the mitochondria work
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=169s)** — better. It's good for anti-aging. It's good for fixing the mitochondria. It's good for
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=174s)** — giving you energy. It's good for a lot of things. And people take NAD all the time.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=179s)** — And the precursor for that is vitamin B3. But this FAD needs vitamin B2. And then if
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=186s)** — you look deeper into what vitamin B2 really does, other than help the mitochondria work
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=191s)** — better, it has everything to do with supporting fatty acids, the membrane around the nervous
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=198s)** — system called the myelin sheath. And when people are grossly deficient in B2, they have all sorts
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=205s)** — of neurodegeneration problems. They have neuropathologies. They have swelling in the
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=212s)** — nervous system. They start losing the myelin sheath around the nervous system. Another condition
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=218s)** — called MS. They can have exaggerated reflexes. And they can also have dementia. Now if you've
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=224s)** — ever heard of a B2 deficiency and like what it creates, a lot of times people might associate
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=230s)** — like taking B2 for migraine headaches and stuff like that. But anything neurological would be
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=236s)** — another reason to take it. This B2 acts as a precursor to help protect the mitochondria.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=243s)** — That is why vitamin B2 is necessary to help correct tremors. Now what about coenzyme Q10?
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=251s)** — Well coenzyme Q10 does the same thing. It helps to transport these electrons, helps you build
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=256s)** — the battery, helps more energy in the mitochondria. But when someone actually takes something like
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=260s)** — statins, which is something that blocks cholesterol, they're going to be deficient in
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=265s)** — coenzyme Q10. And they're going to have all sorts of neurological and muscular symptoms
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=271s)** — because of it. So if someone is on a statin, boy they better take coenzyme Q10 because if
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=278s)** — they don't they're going to have a lot of side effects. But what I did is I did a deep dive
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=282s)** — into all the side effects from statins and take a wild guess what other symptom I found from
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=287s)** — taking statins. Tremors. This is what I want you to try. And then after you try this,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=294s)** — go ahead and comment down below and tell me how it worked out. You're going to take
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=299s)** — high amounts of vitamin B2. I would recommend you take about 800 milligrams per day, split it up into
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=307s)** — two portions. 400 in the morning, 400 before you go to sleep. What about coenzyme Q10? I
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=314s)** — recommend taking higher amounts of that as well. You want a thousand milligrams per day. Maybe
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=319s)** — take 500 in the morning, 500 in the afternoon. So go ahead and try that and comment down below.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=325s)** — And we also want to address the actual diet that may have set you up for deficiency in
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=332s)** — the first place and to know exactly what to eat to fortify your body with all the right
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_Ln5HXkwQ&t=338s)** — nutrients. I put that video right here. Check it out.
