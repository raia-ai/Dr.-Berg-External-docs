- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=0s)** — You know, it's very strange to me that someone going through menopause would have to suffer with
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=8s)** — hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, decreased libido, anxiety, depression. I mean,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=15s)** — that's just weird. And we're told that these symptoms are normal. It's part of life. We
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=20s)** — just have to cope with it and accept it because your sex hormones naturally decrease with age
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=26s)** — by a factor of at least 50% because you're no longer having functional ovaries anymore. Right?
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=34s)** — So the question is, is this true? And the answer is no, it's absolutely false information. When
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=41s)** — you go through menopause, you have two backup organs. They're called the adrenals. And the
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=48s)** — adrenals make all of the hormones that the ovaries make. Okay? All these sex hormones,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=55s)** — estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and they make a lot of other hormones too,
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=61s)** — like cortisol, aldosterone, DHEA, things like that. So the way it's supposed to work is
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=67s)** — during menopause, you have a decreased ovarian function and the adrenals are supposed to back
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=73s)** — it up and start making these hormones. And no, it's not normal to have any symptoms when
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=80s)** — you're going through menopause. So what is the problem? Okay. Well, take a look at this chart.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=85s)** — Right? Here we have a chart of the metabolic pathways through the adrenals, the different
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=91s)** — layers of the adrenal, and the different hormones that are created by your adrenals.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=96s)** — You have mineral corticoids, glucocorticoids, androgen, estrogen, all of these hormones
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=103s)** — stem from this one thing, this one raw material. Check it out right here. Cholesterol. That's right.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=111s)** — The very thing that people are telling you to avoid because it causes heart disease. Right?
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=117s)** — So at the expense of lowering cholesterol through the diet, a diet recommendation,
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=122s)** — or medication, boy, are your adrenals going to suffer because that cholesterol is a required
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=129s)** — material to not only make all of your sex hormones and all of the adrenal hormones that are on the
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=136s)** — outside called the cortex and also cholesterol is the absolute required material to make vitamin D.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=144s)** — And you know how important that is also to make bile salts to help you digest fat,
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=149s)** — to make sure you have enough vitamin A, D, E, K, and also to supply your brain. Do you
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=156s)** — realize that 25% of your brain is cholesterol? In fact, certain cells in the brain, these are
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=163s)** — support cells, they're not neurons, they're called glial cells, make cholesterol. So 75%
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=169s)** — of all the cholesterol in your body right now is made by your own cells, not just by the
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=174s)** — brain cells, but other cells as well. Only 25% comes from the diet. And you might be saying,
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=180s)** — well, I do eat a lot of fat in my diet. I have my olive oil, I have my soy oil, my
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=185s)** — canola oil, I have my avocado oil, I'm consuming my coconut oil. Really? Well, guess what?
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=193s)** — There is no cholesterol in plants or plant oils or seed oils. Cholesterol only comes from
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=200s)** — animal products. And I want to emphasize that 80% of the cholesterol that feeds the adrenals
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=207s)** — is in the form of LDL, that so-called bad cholesterol that we have to avoid. So by
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=217s)** — cutting out cholesterol from the diet, or using medication that lowers the cholesterol,
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=221s)** — there's all these cascade problems, all this collateral damage that can occur,
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=227s)** — including the big ones of menopausal symptoms, depression, anxiety, loss of memory. I mean,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=234s)** — you think about even one of the side effects of statins, which is a medication to block your
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=240s)** — production of cholesterol, one of the symptoms is called transient global amnesia. Okay. You
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=246s)** — have certain times where you just lose your memory. When you're on statins, you actually
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=250s)** — increase the risk of cancer. People with higher cholesterol have lower incidence of cancer. So
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=258s)** — apparently there's this cholesterol immune system relationship. Now that could be because
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=263s)** — of vitamin D or other factors. And we all know the common symptoms from being on a statin
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=267s)** — is muscle pain and muscle problems because of what it does to something called coenzyme Q10.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=274s)** — Okay. That molecule is blocked when you take statins. And that's essential for allowing
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=280s)** — your mitochondria to use fat as fuel. So it's intimately involved in the production of
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=289s)** — especially in your muscles. And so if you starve off the muscle from getting energy,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=294s)** — you get all sorts of problems. And this is one of the biggest side effects and reasons why people
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=300s)** — stop taking statins as the side effect of lowering cholesterol. And so if we take a broad
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=304s)** — look at all the symptoms that women go through during menopause, they all relate to a
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=310s)** — deficiency of sex hormones. And what many women don't realize is the vital importance
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=314s)** — of just supporting this cholesterol to feed these hormones, to make sure they have the
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=322s)** — raw material. And what you're going to find out if you make just a slight change in your
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=326s)** — diet is the very dramatic and sudden disappearance of these menopausal symptoms
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=332s)** — just by increasing more cholesterol in the diet. And now you know why, because all of
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=338s)** — these hormones are built from cholesterol. So start adding more cholesterol to the diet.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=344s)** — And the number one food that can actually help you is high quality grass fed butter.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=351s)** — That's right. Start putting it in your coffee, start putting it in your food.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=356s)** — Don't be afraid to consume real butter. And again, realize that you can't get your cholesterol
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=361s)** — from plants. So all these other oils, okay, which are fine, like olive oil is fine.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=367s)** — Some of these other oils like avocado is fine, but it's not going to help you
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=370s)** — build up your adrenal hormones. And by the way, the more stress that your body goes through,
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=376s)** — especially during menopause, the more cholesterol you need, especially more LDL. Now the key to
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=382s)** — this to make sure that this LDL doesn't end up being the wrong type of LDL because there's
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=388s)** — two different kinds is this. As you increase your dietary fat, you also at the same time
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=395s)** — want to reduce your carbohydrates because you never want to consume a high sugar,
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=399s)** — high carb diet with a high fat diet. As long as you keep your carbs low, as in the ketogenic
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=404s)** — diet, you can consume higher amounts of this fat. So butter is number one. You might want to add
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=410s)** — some fatty cheese like brie cheese. I would recommend grass fed. Don't be afraid to add
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=416s)** — cream. Like I get my raw cream every week from a local farm. Egg yolks, another important
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=422s)** — source of cholesterol, seafood, organ meats are all awesome to help support your adrenals.
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=429s)** — And do not do lean proteins. Okay. Don't do low fat anything because more lean the protein is
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=435s)** — like even protein powders, you're going to stimulate more insulin. The fat helps
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=441s)** — buffer the protein on the insulin index because if you keep the insulin down,
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=447s)** — you're going to be protected. Now during this process, it may be helpful to add vitamin D
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=454s)** — as well as purified bile salts to help you digest this fat. I'm not saying go crazy with
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=460s)** — unlimited amounts of fat. I'm just saying that if you are on a low fat diet, I'm talking about
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=465s)** — low animal fats, you need to start increasing it. And if you have a hard time digesting it,
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=471s)** — chances are you probably don't have enough bile salts. Add those to the mix so you can
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=474s)** — digest it. And you might just be very pleasantly surprised that your menopausal symptoms
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=480s)** — magically disappear. Now, if you have not seen my video on the difference between the two
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=487s)** — different LDLs, this is a very important video to watch. And I put that video up right here.
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjoSBllaONE&t=492s)** — Check it out.
