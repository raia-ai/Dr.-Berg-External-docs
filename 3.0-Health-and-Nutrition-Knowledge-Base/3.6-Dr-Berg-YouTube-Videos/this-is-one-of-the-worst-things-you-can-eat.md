- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=0s)** — I like to share with you the number one absolute worst food that you could consume for your liver,
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=9s)** — especially if you're concerned about developing a fatty liver. And hint, it's not sugar, it's not
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=18s)** — carbs, and this particular ingredient is not even high fructose corn syrup. Even though sugar,
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=24s)** — starch, and high fructose corn syrup is really bad for the liver, there's something much worse. Now,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=30s)** — the big problem with the liver is that there's very few symptoms that occur with the liver.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=35s)** — I had a liver problem for probably, I don't know, 22 years. I didn't know it was a liver problem.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=42s)** — Now, I did have some symptoms, but I didn't connect the dots. A lot of my symptoms were
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=47s)** — my right shoulder, right through this trap right here, and right back into on the back of
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=53s)** — the scapula, and then also right underneath my right rib cage, like right here. It was just always
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=61s)** — just completely, you know, painful, sore, tight, and bloated. For years, I didn't know what that was.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=70s)** — Of course, this problem down here was my bile duct, like the little tubes that connect to the
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=75s)** — gallbladder, but that's part of the liver because the liver makes bile. So, I had this
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=80s)** — problem for a very long time, and that's why I do a lot of videos on the liver because
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=85s)** — I completely reversed it. And that's one big myth that I want to talk about because
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=90s)** — people think that once you have a liver problem, you always have a liver problem. Absolutely
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=94s)** — not. The liver is so robust and so rugged. It's one of the only organs that can completely,
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=101s)** — 100% regenerate. So, that's one myth. Another myth is that the liver is filled with toxins.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=108s)** — It's very toxic. That's not true. The liver detoxifies poisons. It doesn't store
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=117s)** — poisons. The fat cells store poisons. The liver gets rid of the toxins. Once the liver gets
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=124s)** — to the point where it starts developing scar tissue and getting into cirrhosis, the risk
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=131s)** — of getting liver cancer goes way up. The treatment that the medical profession has is not
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=137s)** — very good. It's just like liver transplant. Get on the list. And there's not a lot of people
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=142s)** — that have healthy livers to give you. You're playing this waiting game. Hopefully, you'll be
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=146s)** — able to survive to the point where you can get a liver. Then if you get a liver, you have to
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=151s)** — take anti-rejection medication like prednisone. And now you got to deal with those side
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=157s)** — effects. The simple solution is you want to prevent a liver problem. Now, there is a very
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=163s)** — interesting study on rats that I want to tell you. And there's three groups of rats. And in the
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=169s)** — first group, they fed lard and alcohol to these rats. Okay, lard is pig fat. Second group, they
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=177s)** — fed beef fat. It's called tallow and alcohol to these rats. And then in the third group,
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=183s)** — they fed them corn oil and alcohol. Now, what's interesting is the first group, the lard and
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=190s)** — alcohol, had minimal damage to the livers. And then this test, they were testing for like liver
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=195s)** — damage and then the development into a fatty liver because there was alcohol involved. I kind
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=201s)** — of wish they would have added one more group with this test, like a group of mice that only
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=206s)** — consumed alcohol just to see what would happen. But anyway, the first group that had pig fat,
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=212s)** — lard and alcohol, they had minimal damage to the liver. The next group with the tallow,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=217s)** — beef fat and alcohol, they had virtually no damage to the liver. What does that mean?
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=224s)** — That means that beef fat could potentially be protective to the liver. That's one idea.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=229s)** — That's interesting. It's actually fascinating, especially since I consume a lot of beef fat in
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=235s)** — my diet and I don't seem to have a lot of liver problems anymore. But then the third group
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=240s)** — of rats that were fed corn oil and alcohol, guess what happened to them? Not good. Severe
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=249s)** — liver damage is the most damage of all three groups. The worst food or ingredient we'll call
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=256s)** — it for a fatty liver or a liver in general is seed oils. Seed oils are very inflammatory.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=265s)** — They're very damaging, especially the way that they're processed. Right here, you can see this
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=270s)** — now. What's interesting about this seed oil right here, you see these pictures of the vegetable
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=275s)** — oils because that's where it's called the vegetable oil. To me, that's like false advertising
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=279s)** — because you're having vegetables on there thinking that that oil is coming from vegetables
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=284s)** — when it's not. This is like soy oil. I think just a matter of time before these guys get
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=292s)** — in trouble with advertising because it's not vegetable oil. But the specific type of fat
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=298s)** — that's omega-6 that we're getting way too much, like an average person in the US gets between 25
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=305s)** — to 30 percent of their calories, it's called linoleic acid. And so lard, pig fat, has about
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=312s)** — 2.5 percent of it, linoleic acid. Taylor beef fat only has 0.7 percent linoleic acid.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=321s)** — That's like less than 1 percent. But corn oil has like 56.6 percent linoleic acid. So it's this
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=330s)** — heated linoleic acid in the seed oils that are oxidized or damaged to the point where it can
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=337s)** — create a lot of free radical damage in like a rusting out effect on your cells, especially
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=344s)** — in the liver and the nervous system. And then from that, you get a lot of byproducts. I mean,
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=351s)** — I've done several videos on this topic. If you haven't seen those, you can check them out. But
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=355s)** — you want to get these oils out of your diet big time. Our diet is composed of way too much of
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=361s)** — it, 25 to 30 percent of it. It's highly inflammatory. It also gets lodged and stuck in
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=367s)** — our cells and our fat cells in the membranes around our nervous system for two to three years.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=376s)** — Yeah. So when you eat sugar, for example, you'll burn it off pretty fast. But when you can
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=381s)** — something like this, it gets lodged in the body, it gets stuck in there. We can't even use it as
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=387s)** — energy. So what are we using it as? Well, cell membranes, hormones. I mean, it's going right
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=396s)** — into our tissues and creating all sorts of inflammation and especially inflammation in the
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=402s)** — liver, which then leads to insulin resistance. And you should just start reading the ingredients
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=409s)** — on things. And when you go to restaurants, right, just ask what type of oil are you frying
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=413s)** — my food in? I would avoid anything fried at any fast food restaurant or any restaurant. I
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=419s)** — would not consume them because you're just getting more of the soy oil, the corn oil,
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=423s)** — maybe canola or cottonseed oil. You want to avoid that for at least two to three years
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=429s)** — to get it out of the system. Create a demonstration on yourself how good you could
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=433s)** — actually were to replace that crappy oil with something healthier. You want to start replacing
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=440s)** — with omega-3 fatty acids. That would be like the fish oils, the olive oil, things like that.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=445s)** — That oil is anti-inflammatory. They're not only using this severely damaged oxidative oil,
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=451s)** — but they're reheating it over and over and over up to 100 or more times. I mean,
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=457s)** — you imagine the amount of byproducts that are given off and the amount of
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=463s)** — oxidative stress that's creating for your cells. So number one, remove the seed oils
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=470s)** — from the diet. Start reading ingredients. Number two, start adding in more omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=477s)** — Number three, start decreasing the amount of animal foods like chicken,
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=485s)** — turkey, even beef that are grain fed and even eggs are fed grains unless you can find
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=493s)** — an egg that is higher in omega-3 fatty acids. The point is that you want to start cutting down
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=498s)** — these seed oils and high omega-6 fats from your diet and replace this with grass-fed,
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=506s)** — grass-finished beef, grass-fed lamb, grass-fed goat, grass-fed buffalo, things like that.
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=513s)** — And I also don't think it would hurt if you also added cruciferous vegetables in there like
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=517s)** — cabbage, sauerkraut, things like that because that's really good for the liver as well.
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=522s)** — Now that you know the number one worst food for the liver, let's talk about what foods
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=526s)** — are really good for the liver. And for that information, I put this video up right here.
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJFOF_VEwFs&t=530s)** — Check it out.
