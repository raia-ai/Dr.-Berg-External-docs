- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to debunk 10 health hacks and other forms of treatment.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=5s)** — And number 10 is the absolute worst. And it's not even a health hack, it's actually a treatment
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=10s)** — that basically generates 280 million dollars a year. It doesn't really even work and it's super
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=16s)** — dangerous. Let's dive in. Number one, ear candling. There are people out there who believe that
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=21s)** — when you light one end of this candle, it actually heats up your ear wax and it creates
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=25s)** — a suction effect to pull that wax out of your ear canal and pull it into the candle. I even tried
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=31s)** — ear candles a long ago when I was in practice and I got my wife to do it, I got my parents to do it,
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=36s)** — I got some patients to do it. Because if you look at the pictures, it looks like it really
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=40s)** — works. You're sucking this wax out of your ear because combining the heat of the candle
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=44s)** — and as it burns down, it creates a vacuum and sucks all this wax out and you can actually
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=49s)** — see it. But are you really looking at the wax out of your ear? I watched a great video
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=54s)** — by a doctor of audiology who performed an experiment to look inside the ear before and
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=58s)** — after using these ear candles and he found there's absolutely no difference before and after
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=63s)** — the treatment of removing wax from your ear. So apparently that wax is the wax from the candle.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=68s)** — You might want to save your money on that one. Number two, this one is a gallbladder flush.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=73s)** — I did this one too and it almost killed me. What you're doing is you're going to drink
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=77s)** — 12 ounces of olive oil. Then you're going to chase it down with these beat tablets. I made
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=83s)** — a big mistake of washing down the beat tablets with the olive oil and the beat tablets solidified
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=92s)** — in my esophagus. I almost stopped breathing. I literally got really really scared. I do not
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=98s)** — recommend this. You'll see these videos that they'll show in the toilet. These huge gallstones.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=104s)** — Here's the thing. They're all floating. Gallstones don't float. They sink. What these
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=113s)** — purge. Now you're going to be deficient in bile especially if you're trying to digest fats.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=117s)** — I highly recommend you don't try to purge your gallbladder. A much better way of dissolving
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=123s)** — or preventing gallstones or preventing that sludge which is the formation of a gallstone
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=129s)** — is to actually take more bile. A good bile to take to help dissolve it is something called
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=134s)** — Tudka. Take Tudka on an empty stomach. Take two in the morning, two in the afternoon.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=138s)** — That opens up and gets things to drain. But if you want to add more to help dissolve a gallstone,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=143s)** — you want to start taking bile salts after the meal to help prevent the formation of stones and
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=149s)** — then keep the sludge from turning into a gallstone. I do not recommend purging or
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=153s)** — flushing gallstones by drinking a tremendous amount of olive oil. Number three. The master
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=158s)** — cleanse. Where you're combining lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and maple syrup. And yes,
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=164s)** — long ago, having this idea that I'm going to cleanse and purge all these toxins in my liver,
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=169s)** — that's not the best way to cleanse. It's a great way to create a lot of blood sugar issues
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=174s)** — because if you're doing this cleanse for three days, like I did it, I ate nothing,
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=178s)** — I drank nothing but a gallon of this mixture every single day. The sugar in the maple syrup
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=184s)** — kept me from converting into ketosis and kept me in the sugar burning mode where my blood
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=189s)** — sugar was up and down, up and down. I was like craving sugar throughout the day for three days.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=196s)** — A much better way to do a cleanse would be to just eat healthy foods, especially maybe
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=200s)** — cruciferous foods to provide the enzymes for the liver to slowly detoxify chemicals
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=206s)** — throughout the body. Number four. Those foot detox pads. This is a waste of money. It's
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=211s)** — like $20. You buy these pads. I bought them. You put them on your feet in the hopes of
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=216s)** — pulling out poisons and heavy metals because if you wear them for a period of time and you take
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=221s)** — them off, they'll be black. Right? So that's toxins, right? No, it's some type of chemical
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=226s)** — reaction. You can just pour water on them and then watch them turn black. They're not pulling
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=231s)** — toxins out of your body. There's no detox pathways in your skin. You sweat through your
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=236s)** — skin, but sweating is not necessarily a detoxification. It's going to release excess
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=241s)** — sodium and also water. So you can actually cool the body down because it's kind of creating
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=246s)** — refrigeration action externally on your skin to get rid of excess heat. When these pads have
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=251s)** — certain herbs or certain things on them, it is not creating a magnet for metals. And that
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=256s)** — leads us to number five. The foot detox bath. Go to a clinic. You put your feet in these
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=261s)** — things and it has a certain electrode in there that then generates some current in the
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=266s)** — water. And then all of a sudden the water solution becomes like this brown toxic material.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=272s)** — It's pulling all these heavy metals out, all this toxic waste from your kidneys and your liver.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=277s)** — So you could become very clean, right? Wrong. That's not what's happening. It's not pulling
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=282s)** — any toxins out. You can actually create the same color in this bath without putting your
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=287s)** — feet in it. What's happening when you're adding the salt in there, it's interacting
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=290s)** — with the electrodes to create rust. It's a chemical reaction that has nothing to do with
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=296s)** — coming out of your body. My wife and I were in the Dominican Republic and we did a vacation
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=302s)** — and they had this little place where you can put your feet into these tiny little minnows
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=307s)** — that will eat the dead skin cells off of your feet. So your feet are really smooth after...
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=312s)** — My wife and I did this and it tickled when they were eating or nibbling on our feet,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=317s)** — but I will say it did not make our feet really nice and smooth. I guess you'd have
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=321s)** — to probably put some piranhas in there to do that because these little minnows just
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=325s)** — didn't create an impact on our feet. Number six, the ab belts. There's two different versions.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=329s)** — You have the belt that causes more sweating in your midsection and then you have the belt that
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=336s)** — creates this electric stimulation like it has like a tens unit where it's creating this
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=340s)** — contraction on your stomach muscles because of course wouldn't it be great to not have to
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=345s)** — exercise and you can just wear this belt all day and then at the end of the day you
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=348s)** — pop it off and you have these six-pack abs. Sorry, this one also is not going to work.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=354s)** — Creating stimulation on your stomach muscles or even sweating is not going to remove any
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=359s)** — fat from your midsection. And creating the stimulation without you doing the work
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=363s)** — is not going to help you with your midsection. I'm sorry to tell you that.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=367s)** — Most of that internal fat called visceral fat has to be removed through diet and there are
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=373s)** — also various toning things that you can do to tighten some of the fascia around your
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=377s)** — midsection. You're going to have to actually do something. Number seven, the blood type diets.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=383s)** — I bought the book. Initially it sounded like there is some special technology
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=387s)** — that potentially could work. When you pull a string at the back of the book and search
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=392s)** — where this research goes, it doesn't go anywhere. I can't find any credible research
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=397s)** — on this at all. And that's because yes we have different blood types but these different
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=402s)** — blood types relate to more of an immune difference than a digestive food difference.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=409s)** — If you are type O, the theory is your body thrives on animal proteins and low carbs.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=414s)** — Type A states you should enjoy a vegetarian diet with limited red meat and dairy.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=419s)** — The reason why it does work for certain people is because all of the recommendations
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=424s)** — for foods are whole foods. You're eliminating all the junk foods regardless of what type of
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=430s)** — specific diet you're doing based on the blood type. If you just go from refined foods
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=434s)** — to whole foods, you're going to feel better. You're going to do better. Number eight, EMF
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=439s)** — blockers. The stuff that comes out of this cell phone right here. And so when you have an EMF
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=443s)** — blocker, you're putting this little sticker on the back of your phone and that's supposed to
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=448s)** — block all the EMF waves. I just want to tell you right now, you can save your money. Don't
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=453s)** — buy into that. Because I talked to someone that really knows about this, a physicist,
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=457s)** — and he was just laughing about it because a little sticker on your cell phone is not going
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=462s)** — to block all the EMF radiation or nullify it or kind of suck it into the area. That's not
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=467s)** — how it works. Now you could put a layer of metal or tin foil along there and block it,
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=474s)** — but then you're not going to get transmission. Number nine, carb blockers. Have you ever seen
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=479s)** — those? Three in one carb blocker. That way you can continue to eat your pasta and your bread
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=484s)** — and lose weight. If you look at the ingredient, it has a certain extract from
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=489s)** — beans that does inhibit to a certain degree, starches, not sugar, only to a very tiny degree.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=499s)** — Maybe if you're lucky, it would take a very small percentage, maybe
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=503s)** — 2% of that, the starch in the donut, and it may slow down the enzymes to break it down.
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=510s)** — Thinking that, oh, it's just going to now pass right through me, right?
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=514s)** — Now what's going to happen to that 2% of that starch, it's going to go down into the small
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=519s)** — intestine. If your enzymes don't break it down, your microbes will, then you're going to get
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=523s)** — bloating. Then you might say, well, why don't I just take more of that enzyme? Yeah,
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=528s)** — you could do that. Maybe you could consume nine bottles of the carb blocker to digest
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=534s)** — the starch in the donut, not the sugar, not the seed oils, but the starch. Maybe that
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=539s)** — might want to do an experiment. Be very expensive experiment. And how much pleasure are you going
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=544s)** — to get from eating that one donut if you're blocking just the starch of that donut? Probably
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=550s)** — not going to be worth it. Now we get to the big one, psychiatric medication. It treats the
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=555s)** — symptom of a theory. Depression is a chemical imbalance of a deficiency of serotonin. But
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=564s)** — that's been recently debunked. This whole time, psychiatrists were prescribing all these
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=568s)** — medications for this theory that wasn't even true. The very limited effectiveness of psychiatric
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=574s)** — drugs actually compares with placebo outcomes. Many of the studies that indicate any effectiveness
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=582s)** — from psych drugs is owed to the placebo effect. Then people might say, well, okay, so what if
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=588s)** — it's placebo? If it makes people think it's working, and it works for them, great, right?
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=593s)** — If it didn't account for the serious side effects emotionally, where you even become
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=597s)** — more depressed or have all sorts of problems with even feeling emotion in general. That's
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=604s)** — one of the big side effects is you just feel like a zombie. I mean, are we supposed to get on
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=608s)** — this medication and be on it forever or take it for a period of time until it corrects
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=613s)** — something? No, you keep taking it. It's highly addictive within two weeks. And now you're
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=618s)** — dependent on that. And the whole time the psychiatrist does not evaluate your foods, just
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=622s)** — giving you a pill for a symptom. And it's hilarious because all the things that the
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=627s)** — psychiatrist is against is any alternative to medicine. But the worst psychiatric treatment,
- **[10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=632s)** — even worse, I think, than drugs is the ECT, electro convulsive therapy, if you want to
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=639s)** — call it a therapy. Some doctors even claim that it's safe and effective. They don't even know
- **[10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=645s)** — why it might give some temporary improvement in depression. And they also downplay the
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=650s)** — long-term effects and also how many of these problems and side effects come back.
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=655s)** — And unfortunately, ECT is even administered to certain people that did not give their consent.
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=661s)** — Sometimes they even give it to people in hospice. Like, why would you want to give
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=665s)** — someone in hospice ECT? From my viewpoint, that's probably the most dubious treatment that you
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=670s)** — could possibly do. Especially if we're comparing that treatment to something like
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=673s)** — ear candles. Yet in the news or even online, you don't really see a lot of the dangers
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=678s)** — being promoted with ECT because there's too much money involved. Anyway,
- **[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzMD8v8DFA&t=681s)** — I appreciate you watching. I will see you in the next video.
