- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=0s)** — Recently, I stumbled on something very fascinating relating to Candida. I want to share this with you.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=6s)** — Now, Candida is a fungal infection. It's kind of like a yeast infection. And people can get it in
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=11s)** — their mouth. They can get it in their private parts, toenails. And it usually comes after
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=17s)** — an antibiotic as a side effect because you have all these bacteria that keep the yeast and fungus
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=23s)** — and molds in check. The great majority of your microbiome in your gut is bacteria. But you
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=29s)** — have a small percentage of this yeast and fungus and friendly Candida. So everything is in balance.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=35s)** — But when you wipe out a lot of your bacteria, you create more space for this Candida to grow
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=42s)** — and become a bit pathogenic. So you get itchiness, burning, fatigue, and various symptoms from them.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=50s)** — You can even get cracks in the corner of your mouth. About 20% of the time, that's Candida.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=54s)** — And when I was in practice, I would notice that certain patients coming in had this odor of ammonia.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=61s)** — And that's usually coming from this Candida overgrowth. It'll change your pH. Okay? It releases
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=70s)** — ammonia from the breakdown products of simple sugars. When you go up on the pH, you make
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=76s)** — things more alkaline. And it can survive more. So Candida can actually survive more of an
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=82s)** — alkaline environment versus an acidic environment. And this is why when you have this good balance
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=86s)** — of microbes in your large intestine, it's on the acidic side. But Candida changes the pH.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=92s)** — And so it does it through its primary fuel, which is sugar. Okay? I'm going to come back to
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=97s)** — that at the end, but I want to share something very interesting. There's other conditions that
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=102s)** — lower your immune system that cause this overgrowth as well. HIV or AIDS, if you have
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=110s)** — prednisone, like steroids, if you're pregnant, or if you eat a lot of sugar, especially fructose.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=119s)** — All of them either create or have at the same time a vitamin D deficiency. So when I was
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=126s)** — looking at vitamin D, I noticed that it had an antifungal property. And when I looked into
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=132s)** — it a little bit more, I found out it's a really good, effective, broad spectrum
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=138s)** — antimicrobial. Now probably because it really helps build up your immune system, your defenses,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=143s)** — and all of those items I mentioned really have an effect on the immune system.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=148s)** — If you have Candida, there's three things you need to do. Start taking vitamin D.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=153s)** — Maybe 20, 30,000 IUs immediately. Number two, cut out the fuel for Candida.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=160s)** — Its primary fuel is glucose. If you stop eating sugar right now, go on keto,
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=167s)** — you can starve it to death. And three, start consuming probiotic foods like a little
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=172s)** — sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented pickles, or maybe a little non-sweetened kefir. So I just wanted
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzSoPyA30O8&t=180s)** — to keep this video real simple, short, to the point. Great remedy to help someone if they're
