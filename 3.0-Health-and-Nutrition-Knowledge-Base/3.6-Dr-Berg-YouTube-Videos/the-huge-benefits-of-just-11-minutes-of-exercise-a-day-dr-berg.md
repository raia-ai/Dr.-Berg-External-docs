- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=0s)** — You know, I have a video on inactivity and how that is an actual cause of all sorts of diseases.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=8s)** — But today we're going to talk about exercise in a very unique way. All it takes is just a little bit
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=14s)** — of exercise to produce significant health benefits. And I'm talking about lowering your risk
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=20s)** — for certain diseases and increasing your longevity, living longer. It doesn't take much exercise.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=25s)** — Hopefully this video will inspire you to start exercising, doing some type of physical activity
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=32s)** — on a regular basis. Because exercise is the most potent natural medicine for living longer and
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=42s)** — countering diseases. And I'm going to recommend over time that you really work on establishing
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=48s)** — a fitness reserve which correlates to a health reserve. That extra bit of health buffer to
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=56s)** — counter these stresses that come in on our body and affect us in a negative way. The more fitness
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=62s)** — you have in your reserve, it's like an abundance of fitness, all sorts of great things can happen.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=68s)** — You become more flexible with your metabolism, your eating plan as well, and not have as much
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=73s)** — damage. In other words, you raised up your level of health to a certain degree
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=77s)** — where you can get away with more stuff versus other people don't have that luxury. Unfortunately,
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=83s)** — those are the people that tend to go off the program more often. So if you think about it,
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=87s)** — even if you're a smoker, even if you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=94s)** — or you're overweight or have high blood pressure, if you're exercising on a regular basis,
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=100s)** — those things are not nearly going to have a negative effect on your body if you have this
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=105s)** — So check this out. Walking only 2 to 2.5 hours per week, not per day, per week can give you a
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=114s)** — 20% lower mortality rate. Another study talked about exercising 11 minutes a day, giving you
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=120s)** — a 10% lower mortality rate. Here's another one called Vigorous Intermittent Lifestyle
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=125s)** — Physical Exercise. Just by doing three to four short bouts of intense exercise, like roughly
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=133s)** — a minute each, can give you a 40% lower mortality rate. Now if you were to beef it up to 11 bouts
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=141s)** — of this short intense workouts, like a minute each spread out through the day,
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=146s)** — it was calculated lowering your risk for cardiovascular disease by 65% and a decreased
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=153s)** — risk in cancer by 49%. So this is pretty cool because it's just short little bursts
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=159s)** — So let's say for example you're in the basement of your house and you just use the stairs to run
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=166s)** — up and down the stairs a minute, right? And then you go to your office and do whatever you're
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=171s)** — going to do and then you come back and do it again and do it again. It can be any type of
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=176s)** — high intensity exercise. It could be just taking a break and doing some burpees or doing
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=180s)** — some push-ups or sprinting up a hill. It's pretty easy. Anyone can do a minute workout and
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=186s)** — just do it repetitively. Another study showed 10 to 59 minute workout every week,
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=192s)** — okay, just once a week can decrease your mortality by 18%. So over and over and over
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=198s)** — they've shown that it doesn't take much exercise to help you with your health.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=202s)** — When you're exercising you're doing a lot of interesting things to the inside of your body,
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=206s)** — especially your mitochondria, the energy factory of your body. You're increasing the size and
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=212s)** — your mitochondria, which happened to be behind most diseases. Most diseases are related to
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=219s)** — problems with your mitochondria, including cancer. So anytime you can strengthen your
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=223s)** — mitochondria, you can counter these diseases. The other thing that I'm going to recommend is
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=228s)** — if you have the option of going for a walk after you eat, if you've eaten carbohydrates
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=235s)** — in that meal, you have a chance to burn off those sugars and then they don't affect you.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=240s)** — And this is one of the ways that athletes can get away with eating more carbs, the amount of
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=246s)** — exercise. That fitness reserve really protects your body big time. And developing more fitness
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=254s)** — also improves your insulin sensitivity. So if you had insulin resistance at one time,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=260s)** — developing more of a fitness reserve can greatly help your blood sugars and allow you
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=266s)** — to get to a place where your insulin now finally works. If you're struggling with the
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=270s)** — dawn phenomena where you wake up with your blood sugars higher, well one way to counter
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=274s)** — that is just to build up your fitness reserve. One thing I think that's really important is to
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=278s)** — find some type of fitness activity that you really enjoy, that you're going to do, that
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=285s)** — you're not going to procrastinate. For example, with me, I really enjoy climbing rope, but I'm
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=293s)** — 58 years old and I weigh like 188 pounds and I broke my left shoulder. I just can't quite do
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=300s)** — what I used to do with rope climbing, but I love it. It's a great workout. So I got
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=303s)** — something called the Relentless Rope Trainer, where I can mimic climbing rope and do a great
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=310s)** — workout. I'll do like a hundred rope climbs in a row and I'm good for an entire workout.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=316s)** — I mean it only took me like maybe four, maybe five minutes, and it's a great workout.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=320s)** — It works the entire upper body, the core, and cardiovascular at the same time. And I use that
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=327s)** — several times a week. Another thing that I'm using right now for flexibility training is
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=331s)** — not necessarily high intensity, but it's for stretching. It's called the Mobility Stick.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=337s)** — It really helps to mobilize and add stretching of the upper and lower extremity,
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=341s)** — which can greatly enhance sleeping, stiffness, and stress, especially if you sit behind a desk
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=347s)** — most of the day. So I do a lot of research behind the computer all day, so that really comes
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=352s)** — in handy. So the point is you want to break up your day by scheduled little burst of exercise.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=358s)** — And I would recommend even setting the timer to do that. So several times a day, if you
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=364s)** — can work yourself up to like 11, that would be the ideal situation. But you know just several
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=368s)** — times a day is definitely good. The other point I want to make is that our bodies are
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=372s)** — constantly exposed to stress, and exercise keeps the stress off our body. One very unique
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=379s)** — tool that I use, Heart Rate Variability Technology, which I may have some information
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=385s)** — down below in the description. And this device could be used to help you figure out
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=391s)** — where you are on your fitness level, when you should exercise, how long you should exercise,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=397s)** — when you shouldn't exercise, because it's all about measuring your stress and recovery cycles.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=404s)** — And exercise is a controlled stress that you can add into the mix. And it'll help you
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=409s)** — determine the intensity of exercise, the volume of exercise, and your recovery of exercise.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=415s)** — And HIV by itself is an independent predictor of mortality from heart attacks. Now another
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=422s)** — thing that you can kind of add to this exercise is a sauna. If you have access to a sauna,
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=429s)** — if you have a sauna, if you can go somewhere to sit in a sauna and you do that four times a
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=433s)** — week, that can add a significant benefit. If you can also add intermittent fasting,
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=438s)** — huge benefits for increasing your longevity. Another thing that I personally like to do is
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=443s)** — get out in nature, go for hikes. I do that on a regular basis. If I would have known back
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=449s)** — what I know now, I would have kept up this exercise and been very, very consistent.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=454s)** — I would have been even healthier. If you have not seen my video on how inactivity
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bskn2RrhPM&t=460s)** — could be the cause of certain diseases, check it out. I put it up right here.
