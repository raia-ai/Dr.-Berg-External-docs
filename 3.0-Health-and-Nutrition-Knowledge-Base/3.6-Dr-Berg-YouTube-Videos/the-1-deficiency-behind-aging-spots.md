- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=0s)** — If you have Mitral Valve Prolapse Syndrome, today we are going to talk about the number one nutrient deficiency in this syndrome.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=8s)** — The first question is, what is Mitral Valve Prolapse? Well, you have these valves in the heart.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=12s)** — They are little doors that open and shut. And if they can close and open correctly, the motor,
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=18s)** — the pump is very efficient and you feel great. Everything is fine. But with the Mitral Valve
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=23s)** — Prolapse, they are kind of floppy, they kind of leak, they are kind of large and they can bulge.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=30s)** — And this bulging is called prolapse. Prolapse is kind of a displaced tissue from the normal position.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=37s)** — So we have the valve in the wrong position. It is just not correct. And from that, you get a lot
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=44s)** — of inefficiency of this heart pumping action. And this creates various symptoms like weakness,
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=50s)** — fatigue, palpitations, anxiety, shortness of breath. And if you look this condition up,
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=57s)** — a lot of times you will see a word connected to it called idiopathic. That basically means,
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=62s)** — we do not know what caused it. And this condition is usually treated with either
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=66s)** — beta blockers or a calcium channel blocker. Now, there is a very interesting research
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=72s)** — paper on this. And so I am going to show you what I found. I am going to put those
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=75s)** — in the description. But from the American Journal of Cardiology, there was a double
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=80s)** — blind study done. And the title of this paper was, clinical symptoms of mitral valve prolapse
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=87s)** — are related to hypomagnesemia. See, now you can use that at a party to sound really,
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=94s)** — really smart. You can ask your friends, have you ever been checked for hypomagnesemia?
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=98s)** — Just do not mention my name when you ask them that. Basically, that means you have
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=101s)** — low magnesium in your blood. And attenuated, that means lessened by magnesium supplements.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=110s)** — They had 141 subjects and they compared it to 40 people who did not have this condition.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=116s)** — And the first thing they did is they tested both groups for magnesium deficiency. And they
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=121s)** — found in the group with mitral valve prolapse, there was a 60% deficiency of magnesium. Now,
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=128s)** — the healthy group, only 5% of these people had a magnesium deficiency. And the results were this.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=136s)** — There was a significant decrease in anxiety, weakness, shortness of breath, and palpitations.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=145s)** — And there was also a significant decrease in adrenaline. I do not know if you know this,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=152s)** — but when you have low magnesium, adrenaline tends to go high. Now, check this out. This
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=158s)** — is interesting. A magnesium deficiency accelerates the aging of the fibroblast cell. It is basically
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=167s)** — the cell that helps you make collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid. Now, all three of these
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=174s)** — things are like really important as we age for our skin, for our ligaments, for our tendons,
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=181s)** — for our valves. Well, apparently this is kind of one theory of why we developed this mitral valve
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=188s)** — prolapse. Because of the magnesium deficiency and the fibroblast, the formation of those little
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=193s)** — collagen elastic valves. Now, if you actually watched my other video on magnesium, the one
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=201s)** — where I talk about the first symptom of a magnesium deficiency is tetany, like twitching,
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=207s)** — like that. Maybe underneath the left eye, could be anywhere in the body. If we just take a look at
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=212s)** — tetany in relationship to the heart, this tetany is the heart's equivalent to this mitral
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=218s)** — valve prolapse and its associated symptoms like arrhythmias. Because tetany is a problem with
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=226s)** — the muscle nerve connection. Well, if you have that in the heart, you can have an arrhythmia.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=231s)** — And check this out, 85% of people with mitral valve prolapse have tetany and other places in
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=239s)** — the body. And if we come back to the medications that are used, what does a beta blocker do?
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=246s)** — It blocks adrenaline, the very thing that's increased with a magnesium deficiency. When you
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=253s)** — take magnesium, you don't want to just rely on the RDAs because you're usually already
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=259s)** — deficient. And it takes many years to become deficient. And so if you take a look at like a
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=264s)** — lifelong deficiency of magnesium, just by going to the regular RDAs, you're probably not going
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=270s)** — to fix that problem. Magnesium is tightly regulated. And so when you take magnesium,
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=275s)** — it's going to like, it's not just going to spike up overnight, it's going to slowly
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=280s)** — increase over a period of months. And it could take even a year. I had someone reach out to
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=286s)** — me and they said, you know, I have arrhythmias and I was taking the magnesium and I didn't really
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=292s)** — see any change. I took it for a week. I said, did you realize how long it takes to fulfill
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=298s)** — a chronic lifelong magnesium deficiency? It takes quite some time. I would take 400 milligrams
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=305s)** — twice or even maybe three times a day. And of course, I would work up to it. I would start
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=310s)** — with 400 milligrams for several days, then go up to 800 milligrams. I would take one in the morning,
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=318s)** — one in the afternoon, and then take that for maybe a few weeks, and then maybe even add a
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=323s)** — little bit more. I would also, and this is important, make sure you have enough vitamin D.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=328s)** — Magnesium won't work without vitamin D. Very, very important. And as a minimum amount,
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=334s)** — would take 10,000 I use of vitamin D3. And of course, I would make sure I avoid the things
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=341s)** — that deplete magnesium. Sugar, refined carbohydrates, like the breads, the pasta, the cereal,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=347s)** — the crackers, the biscuits. If we even take a look at what sugar does to magnesium, if you
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=352s)** — were to eat sugar right now, let's just say you're eating glucose as one half of the sugar
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=356s)** — It would take 24 atoms of magnesium to help process and deal with one molecule of glucose.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=369s)** — And then if we get to fructose, to metabolize one molecule of fructose, you need 56 atoms of
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=377s)** — magnesium. And also if you're cooking and boiling the food, you could kind of, you know,
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=382s)** — a lot of magnesium. I mean, in America, there's like 50% of the population that consumes ultra
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=388s)** — processed foods. So you know, every single one of those people are severely deficient in magnesium.
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=395s)** — The main takeaway from this video is this. It takes years for a magnesium deficiency
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=399s)** — to show up. And it also takes a year for the magnesium to be corrected in the body.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=406s)** — And the type of magnesium I would recommend is called magnesium glycinate. Now there's another
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=413s)** — very popular video that I did on magnesium that I highly recommend you watch. I'll
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJu7v9JtD-o&t=418s)** — put it up right here. Check it out.
