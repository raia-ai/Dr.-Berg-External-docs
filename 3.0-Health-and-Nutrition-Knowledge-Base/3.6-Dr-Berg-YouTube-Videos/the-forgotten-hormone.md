- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=0s)** — Today I want to talk about the difference between hormone therapy and glandular therapy, right?
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=7s)** — I know the name for glandular therapy is organotherapy, using organ extracts from animals,
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=14s)** — whether it's a sheep, pig or cow. And this therapy was used in even hospitals in the late
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=19s)** — 1800s, early 1900s, I think up to like in the 30s it was used. But then we started isolating
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=26s)** — hormones in the gland tissue and then making them synthetic. And that's what we have now.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=32s)** — You can get growth hormone, you can get thyroxine, which is T4 in the form of
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=38s)** — Synthroid. You can get estradiol, testosterone, insulin, cortisol, adrenaline. And so this is
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=45s)** — what our treatment for the endocrine system has become. You know, when someone has a hormonal
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=51s)** — imbalance or hormonal deficiency, I always want to ask a question, why? Why are your
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=57s)** — hormones deficient in the first place? There are a lot of complications and side effects
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=62s)** — that occur when you start to do hormonal therapy. If we talk about the endocrine system
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=67s)** — and look at it from a very simplistic viewpoint, you have the gland, you have the hormone,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=72s)** — and you have the connection or receptor where it goes, right? And so what you're looking at
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=78s)** — is a very rudiment communication network. The gland is kind of like the thing that makes the
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=84s)** — hormone. The hormone is the communication. This hormone communication travels through the
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=88s)** — blood and it gets received by a receptor on the other end. And so it's the receptor
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=95s)** — that activates certain functions through genes and certain proteins. And when that activation
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=103s)** — occurs, there's also something else that's very, very important in this communication
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=107s)** — mechanism. And it's the feedback loop that's connected with this communication. In other
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=114s)** — words, it's a control mechanism that's controlled by the receptor. Something is sent back
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=120s)** — to that gland to turn it off. If we're dealing with a negative feedback loop, it's
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=125s)** — very similar to in your house, you have a thermostat that adjusts to certain temperature,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=131s)** — and then it turns off at that temperature. The same exact thing happens with the endocrine
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=135s)** — system. And so when someone does hormonal therapy and they're giving you a hormone,
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=141s)** — the question is, how do you adjust for this feedback loop? How do you know how much exactly
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=147s)** — to give the person and when to give the person? Hormones are created and sent through a
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=153s)** — very complex wave pattern, a circadian rhythm. And a lot of these hormones, especially the
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=159s)** — metabolic ones that actually build things up, are produced and sent mostly in the middle
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=164s)** — of the night when you're sleeping. So when you take this hormone in the day, does that
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=170s)** — complicate things? And so we're trying to mimic this very complex machinery when we actually
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=175s)** — take a hormone. And especially because the hormone we're taking is usually not a natural
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=179s)** — hormone, it's a synthesized isolate of that hormone. And there are many side effects,
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=184s)** — which I'm going to go through. The first thing you need to know is when you take these
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=187s)** — hormones as hormone therapy, you actually inactivate the gland that produces that
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=193s)** — hormone. So you basically put that gland asleep because you're bypassing the whole mechanism
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=197s)** — and you can cause atrophy of that gland. As in one of the side effects from testosterone
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=205s)** — therapy, right? You actually cause testicular atrophy. Or even when you take Synthroid T4,
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=212s)** — you actually cause atrophy of that gland. So now your body is dependent on that external supply.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=219s)** — You should just be aware of that. I'm not telling you not to do it, but you should just
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=222s)** — know that going into this therapy. Like let's take growth hormone. Are there any complications?
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=228s)** — Yeah, big time. Carbal tunnel syndrome, insulin resistance, type two diabetes,
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=235s)** — edema, increased breast tissue, increased risk of cancer. Now what about when you're taking
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=241s)** — hormones? Well, insomnia, headache, tremor, chest pain, increased pulse rate, fatigue and heat
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=248s)** — intolerance. And then what about estradiol like estrogen? Well, there's a lot of bad effects
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=255s)** — that occur from that hormone. One is breast cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=263s)** — stroke, blood clots, gallstones. But other than that, you can be perfectly fine.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=267s)** — Now with testosterone therapy, it doesn't come without problems too. Acne, testicular atrophy,
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=274s)** — aggression, deeper voice, hoarseness, mood swings, insomnia, et cetera, et cetera.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=281s)** — Now what about insulin therapy? Is there any complications? Yeah, I think the majority of
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=285s)** — the population right now is doing an experiment with insulin therapy. Of course, it's through
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=289s)** — eating a lot of refined carbs. But when you actually take insulin, it doesn't come without
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=296s)** — effects. Number one, you're going to get weight gain, mood issues, low potassium, swelling,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=303s)** — heart problems, heart failure even. And if someone takes too much, they can end up in a coma.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=309s)** — In fact, that was one of the therapies early on in the 1900s, giving people insulin shock
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=315s)** — therapy, where they give them insulin, put them in a coma, and they wake up greatly over
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=319s)** — weight. But apparently that was used for all sorts of mental problems. Well, but right now,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=324s)** — don't do that. They use electric shock therapy, which is definitely a lot worse.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=329s)** — All right. What about the adrenal hormones? Right? Is there any problems with taking cortisol
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=333s)** — in the form of prednisone, which is a synthetic type of cortisol? Well, I'm a perfect example
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=338s)** — that I had to take steroid shots every year for probably, I don't know, 12, maybe 15 years
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=345s)** — because of poison ivy. Now I'm resistant to it. It created a lot of problems for me. It
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=354s)** — affects from cortisol are diabetes, a very lowered immune system, cortisol resistance,
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=362s)** — which means now it doesn't really work. Just the same thing with insulin. You can get insulin
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=365s)** — resistance too. And now it doesn't work anymore. And so when you have cortisol
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=369s)** — resistance or even insulin resistance, you get now a deficiency of that hormone. So if you
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=375s)** — don't have enough cortisol, okay, you'll get a lot of inflammatory conditions, a lot of skin
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=381s)** — problems. This is why one of the common treatments for dermatitis and skin problems
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=387s)** — is steroid creams. But other symptoms would be insomnia. That was me. Mood problems,
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=394s)** — agitation, and anxiety. So as you can see, there's a lot of side effects from this
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=399s)** — hormonal therapy. Okay. A much better strategy, which I would recommend, would be using
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=408s)** — glandular therapy, right? Using glandular extracts. Now, what would that do that's
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=413s)** — different than hormonal therapy? Well, you're supporting the entire endocrine system as a
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=420s)** — whole. When you take a glandular, you're getting a lot of things in that gland.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=424s)** — You're getting nutrition. I mean, just take a look at glands as far as out of all the
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=430s)** — foods that people eat. And, you know, people are focused on eating muscle meat and
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=433s)** — that, but what about the rest of the animal? Right? We used to eat glands early on. And out
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=440s)** — of all the things that you can eat, your glands and organ meats are the most nutrient dense.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=446s)** — So number one, we're going to support the endocrine system with a super nutrient dense
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=450s)** — substance. But you also have other things. You have growth factors, you have proteins,
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=456s)** — certain amino acids, peptides, which are chains of amino acids, cofactors, minerals,
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=463s)** — enzymes. You have the whole package, especially if it's freeze dried,
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=467s)** — glandulars. Now, I think the big reason why we don't use glandulars anymore is because
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=472s)** — apparently it's not practical. That's kind of expensive. If you can take a look at what it
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=477s)** — would take to synthesize a hormone, you can do it at a much higher scale. You can refine
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=482s)** — it, you can synthesize it. But the question is, is it a better treatment? Well, you judge,
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=487s)** — but there's a lot of history on glandulars. For example, in 1891, there was a doctor named
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=494s)** — Dr. George Murray, and he demonstrated that mixed edema in hypothyroid cases.
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=501s)** — Mixed edema is that kind of that puffiness that you would get that looks like fat,
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=504s)** — that it's not really fat. It's kind of a waste product from metabolism.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=508s)** — Well, this doctor demonstrated that by taking thyroid extract from a sheep,
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=513s)** — he can resolve that problem. Other doctors were using extracts of the parathyroid gland
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=518s)** — in treating tetany or muscle problems after someone had surgery. Now, tetany is at twitching.
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=525s)** — The parathyroid regulates calcium. So somehow taking the parathyroid gland helped that.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=531s)** — I know when I was in practice, I use whole desiccated adrenal a lot. So I would use
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=536s)** — the adrenal gland for all sorts of things related to the adrenal. And I would see quite
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=542s)** — good results. But of course, you're not going to probably see a lot of money invested into
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=546s)** — doing double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trials on glandulars because
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=550s)** — you can't really patent them. But you can still get like armor thyroid. Okay. That's using
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=557s)** — the whole gland instead of just one hormone. People lose more weight on armor than just
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=562s)** — synthroid. One study showed that they lost an additional three pounds of weight when they
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=568s)** — took armor versus synthroid. There was also additional benefits of just feeling a much
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=573s)** — better sense of wellbeing when taking armor versus synthroid. When you take the whole gland
- **[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=579s)** — as a unit, you're getting a very complex, it's like a whole food vitamin versus some isolated
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=586s)** — vitamin. But anyway, I wanted to introduce you to yet another possibility. If you're
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=591s)** — suffering with certain type of endocrine problems, there are glandulars that you could
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=595s)** — take that potentially could help you. And unfortunately, when you're trying to find
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=600s)** — answers in other viewpoints, other than traditional medical care, it's difficult.
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=607s)** — But sometimes you just have to understand, for example, like growth hormone, what gland
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=612s)** — produces that? That's the pituitary. What other hormones are made by the pituitary that you
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=617s)** — could support so you're not necessarily taking a specific hormone. You can just take the
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=624s)** — extract to support the whole thing. You can even get like the hypothalamus as an extract.
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=631s)** — And since we're on the topic, that's not necessarily glandular tissue, but there's also
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=636s)** — other organs and tissues that can benefit you. For example, like liver, there's probably no
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=642s)** — other nutrient dense organ than the liver with iron and B12 and vitamin A. But you also have
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=650s)** — glean that can help the immune system and the thymus gland, which is a gland, but that would
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=655s)** — be something to take for the immune system. And then you even have something like the trachea
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=660s)** — tissue, right? Which is apparently really good for joint issues or connective tissue or
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=664s)** — cartilage. I've seen some good results myself. Now, since we're on the topic of the endocrine
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=669s)** — system, I think the next thing to watch would be my video on what to eat to support
- **[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMEDTX3JqOs&t=676s)** — your endocrine system. I put that right here. Check it out.
