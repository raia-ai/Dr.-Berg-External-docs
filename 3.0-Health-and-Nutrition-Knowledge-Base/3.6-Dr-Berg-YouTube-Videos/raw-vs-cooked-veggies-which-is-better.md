- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the benefits of raw versus cooked vegetables. Is it better to consume your
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=5s)** — vegetables cooked or raw? Now, to understand that question, we have to first understand what's in a
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=12s)** — vegetable. Okay, how does it benefit us? You have like folate, vitamin C, then you have beta
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=18s)** — carotene, which is like a precursor to vitamin A, which doesn't really add up to a lot of active
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=25s)** — retinol. So if you compare plant-based vitamins versus animal-based vitamins,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=30s)** — the animal-based vitamins are much more bioavailable. Like the iron in spinach versus
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=36s)** — the iron in red meat. Huge difference as far as how your body can assimilate it. So if you do
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=42s)** — this comparison, most of the vitamins in animal products are way more bioavailable. But when we
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=51s)** — look at plant-based products, you have vitamin C, folate, beta carotene. Those are better sources
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=54s)** — in plants. You also have vitamin E in plants. So we have vitamins and then we have minerals,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=63s)** — especially potassium, magnesium. Magnesium is at the heart of the chlorophyll molecule,
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=69s)** — and that's the green stuff in the plant. So anything green that you eat has a good amount of
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=75s)** — But we also need that potassium. There's other minerals as well in plants. You have trace
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=81s)** — minerals and things like that. But it really depends on what that plant is grown on. For
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=87s)** — example, if you're eating plants that are grown in hydroponic, in just like a water
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=92s)** — solution, they only really put 15 minerals in that solution. Well, there's a lot more than
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=99s)** — 15 minerals in the soil. But then again, if you're growing your plants on soil that has
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=103s)** — no biology or microbes, chances are they're going to be pretty low in minerals. What about
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=110s)** — amino acids like proteins? There's not a lot of protein or amino acids in these plants. What
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=116s)** — about fat? There's not a lot of fat in these plants. What about fiber? There is a lot of
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=121s)** — fiber in vegetables and this is what we can feed our microbes. And what's interesting about
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=127s)** — is that herbivores, animals that consume plants, have more than double the strains of microbes
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=134s)** — versus the carnivore animals. They have less than half of the quantity of microbes.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=143s)** — So basically, if you eat vegetables and you're eating a wider range of vegetables,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=147s)** — which with different fibers, compared to someone who doesn't consume any vegetables,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=152s)** — you're going to have more diverse microbiome. And what those microbiome do is they make
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=160s)** — all sorts of things for you. They make vitamins. They make biotin. They make other
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=165s)** — B vitamins. They make vitamin K. They actually help you make bile. They help you make B12
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=173s)** — available. But here's something that you definitely get that you normally don't get from
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=177s)** — foods. And that would be phytonutrients. So we're talking about antioxidants,
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=184s)** — plant-based chemicals that have a range of properties from anti-inflammatory to chemicals
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=191s)** — that help fight cancer. And these phytochemicals are in the thousands and it's like a mini
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=196s)** — natural drugstore because they create all sorts of very, very cool effects. A common one would
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=202s)** — be like lutein or xanthin, which is essential for being able to see in the dark at night
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=211s)** — and prevent macular degeneration. And these phytonutrients also defend against the
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=216s)** — complications of chronic disease. Also, they go into your skin and protect you against
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=222s)** — UV radiation to prevent skin cancer. And this is something you probably have never heard of
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=227s)** — Plants contain a very good amount of probiotics. That's friendly bacteria,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=236s)** — microbes that are within the plant. And there's a lot. Like in one cup of a vegetable,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=244s)** — you're looking at a hundred million microbes. So when you're consuming vegetables, you're
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=249s)** — getting a lot of probiotics. If they're grown on soil versus something that doesn't have a
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=257s)** — kind of a medium that enhances the microbiome. But the way that the plant gets the microbes
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=263s)** — is from the soil. So the roots of the plant actually eat microbes as their primary nutrient
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=269s)** — source and they're extracting minerals from it. And then they actually kind of let the
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=273s)** — microbe go out of the root. But some actually travel up into the plant. And those are the
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=277s)** — ones that I'm talking about. You probably never looked at these raw vegetables as a
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=286s)** — discovered that plants have these microbes. Before that, they thought they were sterile,
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=292s)** — but they're not. Microbes get destroyed with heat. Okay. So the more you cook the vegetable,
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=300s)** — the less effect you're going to have as a probiotic. Now a couple things you need to know
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=305s)** — about this. An organic vegetable versus conventional, you're going to get about 40%
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=310s)** — more also diversity too. So yes, organic is better. And the microbes in the plant
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=317s)** — create substantial change in your own gut microbiome. And if you're concerned about
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=325s)** — these microbes surviving the stomach, apparently they do survive in large quantities,
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=330s)** — probably being protected with the little encapsulated fiber that they kind of are in.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=336s)** — Then they kind of get released lower in the digestive tract when your microbiome
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=342s)** — eats that fiber and breaks them up. Now that being said, there's a couple little things you
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=348s)** — need to know. If you are immune compromised, if you have inflammation in your gut, if you have
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=356s)** — celiac, diverticulitis, any type of inflammatory condition in your gut, you're
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=361s)** — probably not going to tolerate some of the microbes that are in the vegetable because those
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=365s)** — microbes can act to stimulate your immune system. They can act like a natural vaccine.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=371s)** — And if here you are having inflammation or leaky gut, these microbes and other
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=375s)** — phytonutrients and the fiber itself can react and create more inflammation.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=381s)** — This is why if you consume vegetables and you feel worse, or you get extreme bloating,
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=388s)** — or you have any type of major inflammatory condition in your gut,
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=392s)** — you're probably going to do better on the carnivore for a while. So not everyone can tolerate
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=399s)** — these plants. But I will say that things like salmonella, E. coli, those incidents are very
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=407s)** — rare. They're not very common. And if a plant is sick or grown on poor soils that are
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=416s)** — with low immune system, because if the soil has an immune system and so does a plant,
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=420s)** — then they're more likely to get these pathogens. But typically these microbes and plants
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=425s)** — are pretty friendly. There might be a small group of them that are unfriendly or pathogenic.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=431s)** — But the other microbes and the phytonutrients, one of their purposes is to help suppress these
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=438s)** — pathogens and keep that plant's immune system strong. Another side note that's interesting is
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=444s)** — that fermented vegetables, as far as looking at the microbes in those fermented vegetables,
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=449s)** — like sauerkraut, kefir, things like that, those microbes have a very similar profile to your own
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=457s)** — gut microbiome. Which means that the worse off your digestion is, the more you're going to
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=464s)** — benefit from maybe fermented vegetables or no vegetables at all, or even more cooked
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=471s)** — vegetables because you're breaking down things, making them easier to absorb and digest. What
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=477s)** — about the effect of heat on vitamins? Well, you are going to lower vitamin C and you are
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=484s)** — going to destroy a lot of the vitamins and enzymes. What about minerals? Well, it depends.
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=488s)** — If you are steaming them versus boiling them, a lot of times when you boil vegetables and you
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=494s)** — see all the green in the solution, you're basically leaching out chlorophyll and you're
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=502s)** — minerals. But if you steam or slightly steam or saute your vegetables, you're not going to lose
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=509s)** — the mineral part. You might lose some of the vitamins depending on the duration and the heat
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=516s)** — and the temperature. When we talk about phytonutrients, there's some interesting data
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=520s)** — on that. It shows that heat, especially when you steam things or saute things, you actually
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=528s)** — increase the phytonutrient content. You make some of those phytonutrients more available.
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=535s)** — Now, I looked at the data and I didn't see that it was consistent. There's a lot of mixed
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=541s)** — studies on this and it didn't look like there was a massive increase. There might have been
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=547s)** — an increase in phytonutrients by 18 percent and yet other ones showed a decrease by 6 percent.
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=553s)** — It's a bit inconsistent because there are so many different phytonutrients and so many other
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=557s)** — variables. It's hard to tell. But the point is that cooking your vegetables might enhance the
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=563s)** — phytonutrients by a certain amount. But I don't think that is so significant that you have to
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=569s)** — really put a lot of attention on it. Now, what does heat do for the microbes in the plant?
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=575s)** — Well, the heat kills them. So based on that information, it's probably going to be
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=582s)** — to consume a good portion of your vegetables raw. But of course, certain things I think you
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=589s)** — should cook like Brussels sprouts, maybe broccoli, maybe cauliflower. But as far as your salads go,
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=597s)** — and let's say bell peppers and tomatoes and other vegetables, I would keep those raw.
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=603s)** — Apparently, the worst thing you can do to vegetables as far as nutrients go is
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=607s)** — Now, if you're eating some fried vegetables, that's fine. But just don't think you're getting
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=613s)** — a lot of nutrients from the fried vegetables or when you do pressure cooking, things like that.
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=619s)** — Anyway, I wanted to give you some backgrounds on whether you should consume raw versus cooked
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=623s)** — vegetables and some different viewpoints that you probably haven't heard before. Now, if you
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=628s)** — have not seen my video on sauerkraut, I think you should check it out. It's actually very,
- **[10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepoaLLacXg&t=632s)** — very good. And I put it up right here.
