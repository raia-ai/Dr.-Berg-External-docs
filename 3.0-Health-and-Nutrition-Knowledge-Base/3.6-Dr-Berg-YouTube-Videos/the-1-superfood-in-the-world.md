- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=82s)** — having a menstrual cycle, as well as after a surgery. I remember when I had my shoulder

- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8QqHBDxA94&t=108s)** — to stop taking it. If you're on warfarin or you're on some type of blood thinner or aspirin,
