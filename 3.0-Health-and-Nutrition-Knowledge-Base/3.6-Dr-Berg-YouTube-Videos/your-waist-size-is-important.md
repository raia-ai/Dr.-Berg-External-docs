- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=0s)** — I want to discuss the relationship between your friendly bacteria, your gut bacteria.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=6s)** — We are going to call that microbiome and your immune system.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=10s)** — In fact, 70% of your immune system really is this microbiome, your gut bacteria.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=17s)** — You have trillions and trillions of microbes living in and around your body
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=21s)** — that are constantly exchanging with you.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=25s)** — You are giving them a place to live and what they give you is immune protection.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=29s)** — They give you nutrients, they help your blood sugars, and they give you other things that are beneficial.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=35s)** — There are over 10,000 different species of friendly bacteria in and around your body.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=43s)** — And 99% of them are non-pathogenic. They are the good guys.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=47s)** — The great majority of microbes in your body are living in the large colon, just above and in the mucus layer.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=56s)** — And then you have the colon cells and then you have another layer of protection
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=61s)** — where you have certain immune cells or guards waiting for an invader to pop through so they can attack and eat them up.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=68s)** — What happens is when you have an imbalance in the microbiome, you start to lose your gut lymphatic layer.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=77s)** — You start to have a decrease in your lymph nodes.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=81s)** — You start to have less antibodies. And antibodies are those things that attach on microbes.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=88s)** — They don't kill the microbes. They put a tag on them for other immune cells to kill them.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=94s)** — Antibodies are very specific to different pathogens.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=97s)** — And then you also have a decrease in the T cell production.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=100s)** — And T stands for thymus because the thymus gland helps train the T cells.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=107s)** — And you are going to have less of that.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=108s)** — The primary function of the thymus gland is central tolerance.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=115s)** — Able to tolerate your own cells that are beneficial to you.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=120s)** — Because if you did not have that function, these soldier cells, they are like special forces,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=127s)** — would not be able to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=130s)** — And they would end up killing both of them.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=133s)** — And you would end up with your own body cells getting attacked.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=136s)** — That is a condition called an autoimmune disease.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=140s)** — Autoantibodies are antibodies that are basically attacking your own tissue.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=145s)** — But they are not really attacking. They are tagging your own tissue as being a bad guy.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=151s)** — And other immune cells like T cells are going in there and actually trying to attack them.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=157s)** — And that creates inflammation.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=159s)** — And when you have autoimmune conditions, you always have inflammation.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=162s)** — And that is really what is happening. You are getting this constant attack.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=165s)** — And because the microbiome is so heavily connected to your immune system,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=171s)** — when you lose this, you lose this, and you lose the tolerance.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=175s)** — And you lose the ability to learn to differentiate.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=178s)** — Now we have a situation where we have a lot of friendly fire,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=182s)** — and we have a lot of collateral damage in the body and a lot of inflammation.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=186s)** — T cells not only differentiate between your cells and a pathogen cell,
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=191s)** — it is quite amazing that your body has this ability to differentiate
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=195s)** — trillions of cells from pathogens that are not necessarily your cell,
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=202s)** — but they are so intimately involved and they are such a helper to your body
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=206s)** — that your body has developed a system to keep them alive and not attack and kill them.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=211s)** — And also there are certain T cells that suppress inflammation.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=215s)** — So if we lose that, what do we get? A lot of inflammatory conditions.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=220s)** — If we also don't have enough microbiome, we get less small chain fatty acid,
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=225s)** — and one would be called butyrate.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=227s)** — And butyrate is not only helpful in balancing your blood sugars
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=231s)** — and definitely improving insulin resistance,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=234s)** — but it's also there to help improve your immune system.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=237s)** — Also you have less ability to make B12, B1, vitamin K, biotin,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=243s)** — and even lactic acid, which makes the environment for pathogens very uncomfortable.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=251s)** — Also the microbiome are hoarding the food and the space
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=257s)** — to also limit the amount of pathogenic bacteria to exist.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=262s)** — And the less microbiome you have, the weaker the intestinal barrier,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=266s)** — and then you start getting leaky gut.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=268s)** — And I really think, and this is my own opinion,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=270s)** — that autoimmune disease starts in the gut.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=274s)** — If you ever talk to someone who has an autoimmune disease,
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=277s)** — and I'm talking about like Hashimoto's, Crohn's, Lupus, MS,
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=282s)** — they almost always have a gut problem.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=286s)** — In my other videos when I talk about COVID-19, the coronavirus,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=291s)** — the way that that virus attacks your cell is through a receptor called the ACE2 receptor.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=297s)** — Well, it just so happens that your gut has way more ACE2 receptors than the lung tissue.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=305s)** — So this is another mode of entry into the cell that goes beyond just your lung infection,
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=311s)** — which is quite interesting.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=312s)** — If you want to know what to do to support the microbiome,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqXHYgKKtY&t=317s)** — check out this video right here.
