- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=0s)** — This is actually quite amazing. There is zero evidence that depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain involving serotonin,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=13s)** — despite years of selling massive amount of drugs. The amount of money that these drug companies made on this theory is astronomical.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=26s)** — It's only a theory and there's no evidence that increasing or decreasing serotonin in the brain does anything for depression.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=36s)** — It has been found that SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, basically these are medications to block the reuptake or the absorption of serotonin so you'll have more serotonin in the brain.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=49s)** — They have found that when you give someone this drug it does increase at least temporarily the available serotonin in the brain.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=58s)** — The drug trials on SSRIs show that these antidepressants are barely indistinguishable from the actual drug and the placebo in treating depression.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=70s)** — But they come with a package. A lot of side effects including something called a black box warning.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=77s)** — In fact all psychiatric drugs have a black box warning which means they have a high risk of suicide thoughts and behaviors.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=86s)** — But on top of that there's some serious side effects involving the sex organs.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=91s)** — I'm talking about lack of orgasm, penile and genital anesthesia which is the loss of feeling of your private parts, erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=104s)** — So it's just bizarre to me that we have all these high risk for side effects yet we don't have any evidence on this theory that it actually will work for you.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=114s)** — There's even some research that shows that it's the elevation, it's the high levels of serotonin that causes depression not low levels.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=123s)** — And in other experiments where they actually tried to lower serotonin they did not find that a person gets depressed when you lower their serotonin.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=131s)** — So as far as the treatment of depression with pharmaceuticals you really need to think twice and three times and four times and evaluate all the risks and the benefits.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=142s)** — As well as understanding the mechanism of what happens when you're taking a drug to manipulate the neurotransmitters.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=151s)** — So neurotransmitters are communication particles and they go from one neuron to the next.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=158s)** — Very similar to hormones that work in your blood yet neurotransmitters work within the nervous system.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=164s)** — And there's quite a few neurotransmitters. I think there's over a hundred and they create all sorts of effects.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=170s)** — But when you artificially try to manipulate these neurotransmitters you kind of screw up the whole communication within the neurons itself.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=178s)** — And when we talk about depression does depression cause body problems?
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=185s)** — Okay, or is it body problems causing depression? Is it the chicken or the egg?
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=190s)** — Well I think it's both because you can have a stress event, you can have a severe loss and be depressed.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=195s)** — And have that depression severely affect your physical health.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=201s)** — But on the other hand you could have certain types of physical health problems and deficiencies that can directly cause depression.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=210s)** — And that is the area that I want to talk about. So there are four main things that I think cause a physical reason why a person is depressed.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=218s)** — The first one is insomnia. Insomnia increases the risk of getting depression by a factor of 10x.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=228s)** — That's a thousand percent increase. That's pretty significant.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=232s)** — And when someone can't sleep they usually have a problem with this neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=241s)** — Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that the vagus nerve operates with.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=247s)** — And the vagus nerve is all about countering stress as far as it being the parasympathetic nervous system opposing the sympathetic which is the flutter fight.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=259s)** — The parasympathetic is all about rest and digest.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=264s)** — And this is why if you're deficient in acetylcholine, boy you have problems with digestion.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=269s)** — You can't make hydrochloric acid. You can't release bile. You can't release enzymes.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=276s)** — Your peristalsis, the ability of your stool to go through the tubes through the digestive tract, are inhibited.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=284s)** — So acetylcholine is very very important in digestion but also equally important in rest.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=291s)** — So there are several things that can help increase acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=298s)** — Having enough vitamin B1, very important. Having enough choline.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=304s)** — On my DNA test, one of the problems I had genetically is I have a difficult time absorbing choline.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=311s)** — So I have to take more choline. And the foods that are highest in choline are number one, egg yolks.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=320s)** — Okay, egg yolks are very high in choline. Beef liver, which a lot of people don't like.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=324s)** — So I recommend doing egg yolks and fatty fish. Another vitamin that can greatly help increase
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=331s)** — your acetylcholine is vitamin D. I would take at least 10,000 IUs before bed.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=339s)** — It helps a lot of people with insomnia and you might even need to take a little bit more
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=343s)** — because so many people are deficient in vitamin D. And also getting out and having enough sun is
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=348s)** — also even a better choice if you have the option. But just don't let yourself get burned.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=353s)** — But with the sun, you not just get vitamin D, you also get
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=358s)** — melatonin, which comes from the infrared. Over 50% of the sun's rays are infrared.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=366s)** — And it penetrates even through your clothes, even through a hat. So you can get the benefit
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=371s)** — of the melatonin increase as well through the sun. But vitamin D is very, very important.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=376s)** — Vitamin B5 is also very important. Vitamin B5 is very easy to get from pretty much almost
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=383s)** — all foods. So that's usually not the problem. And then another thing that can also help
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=388s)** — increase acetylcholine is magnesium. And the type of magnesium that I would recommend
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=395s)** — for insomnia would be magnesium trienate. That's the one that penetrates the blood-brain
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=401s)** — barrier and can greatly help that neurotransmitter and help you sleep. How does someone end up with
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=407s)** — more amounts of acetylcholine? One big one is high carb diets, sugar, insulin resistance.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=415s)** — Okay, that blocks these neurotransmitters, especially acetylcholine. All right, so number
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=420s)** — one is insomnia. Number two is the thing that you get as a side effect from insomnia,
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=427s)** — chronic fatigue, right? You're going to be tired if you have insomnia. So chronic fatigue
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=432s)** — can definitely cause someone to be depressed because they don't have the energy. And it could
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=438s)** — be a dysfunctional mitochondria, okay, the energy factory, because the person is missing
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=442s)** — something like coenzyme Q10 or even B1. Also, a person can be chronically fatigued if they have
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=451s)** — a virus, okay? I'm talking about one of those viruses that can go in remission and
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=456s)** — out of remission, like the Epstein-Barr virus, which a lot of people have a problem with.
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=460s)** — And then they can become chronically fatigued and then they can become depressed. And you just
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=466s)** — have to find out why you're chronically fatigued. Is it your diet? Is it the lack of sleep? Is it
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=472s)** — a viral infection? Which actually, it's very common to have a viral component because of the
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=478s)** — next thing. Number three, stress, especially chronic stress, can reactivate a virus and cause
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=487s)** — chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. And so chronic stress is another huge factor
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=493s)** — of why people can become depressed. That chronic stimulation of cortisol, which directly
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=500s)** — will cause insomnia. A lot of people who have these viruses that are coming out in remission,
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=507s)** — it's usually always after some stress event. So this is not a little thing, it's a big
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=513s)** — thing. So if you are chronically stressed, find out whatever is stressing you out and
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=518s)** — see what you can do to improve it. And number four, nutritional deficiencies can directly cause
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=523s)** — depression. The big one is a vitamin D deficiency. Now do you see how they cross over from not
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=530s)** — having enough sun or enough vitamin D? Or even the stress factor can deplete you of vitamin D,
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=536s)** — but a vitamin D deficiency can directly make you depressed. I mean think about what happens
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=540s)** — during the winter months. So many people get the blues. It's a vitamin D. Minimally 10,000 I use,
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=546s)** — but I would usually if someone is depressed recommend like 20,000 to 30,000 I use every
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=551s)** — single day. And if it's going to work, it's going to work within a few days and you'll
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=556s)** — feel much better. The next deficiency that can cause direct depression would be a B12 deficiency.
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=563s)** — This can usually come from a person being on antacids or they have inflammatory problems in
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=569s)** — gut or they're a vegan and don't consume animal products or they had a gastric bypass
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=576s)** — or they're getting older and they just don't have enough hydrochloric acid in their stomach.
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=581s)** — So there's many different reasons. A vitamin B1 deficiency, which usually comes from consuming
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=586s)** — too much sugar, coffee, tea, chocolate, mainly though too many carbs can cause depression,
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=596s)** — but most of the time it starts off with anxiety and worry and then that can lead to depression.
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=603s)** — So anxiety is a lot of worry and stress. Depression is kind of like I give up,
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=610s)** — I'm hopeless or I'm sad. If someone has a magnesium deficiency, they can also be
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=617s)** — chronically fatigued or they can be depressed because the influence of magnesium on the energy
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=623s)** — generation of ATP, they can just have not enough energy and they're going to feel very very down
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=629s)** — and sometimes depressed or exhausted. I mean when you think about it, can you actually be
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=634s)** — depressed if you have a lot of energy? It's kind of hard. And the last point about depression
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=639s)** — as far as the nutritional efficiency is the omega-3 DHA because that makes up a good portion
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=646s)** — of your brain and if you're deficient in that because you don't consume DHA, that can
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=653s)** — depression. So those are the four factors. I do want to add one more thing. It's exercise
- **[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=659s)** — and the lack of it. The more you exercise, the less depressed you're going to be. You're
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=665s)** — going to build up your mitochondria. You're going to generate energy. It's going to help
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=669s)** — you reduce stress. It's going to help you sleep better. So don't forget about exercise.
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=675s)** — Now there's a bit more information on insomnia that I want you to know about from this video
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJ2zWYttOk&t=680s)** — right here. Check it out.
