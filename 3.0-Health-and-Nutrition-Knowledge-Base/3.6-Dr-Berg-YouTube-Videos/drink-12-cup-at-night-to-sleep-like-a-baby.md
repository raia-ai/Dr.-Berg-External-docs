- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=0s)** — Now, if you want to sleep like a baby, you definitely want to watch this video. Of course,
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=4s)** — babies are up all night crying and I'm being very sarcastic. This video is kind of a remake of a
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=9s)** — video I did a year ago on consuming kefir in the evening to improve your sleep. Kefir is way,
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=17s)** — way better than yogurt and I'm going to talk about why. When you consume kefir, you're
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=20s)** — giving these microbes a place to live and in exchange, it gives you a lot of other benefits.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=26s)** — The big one is going to be sleep. So how can kefir help you sleep? Well, first of all, what is
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=32s)** — kefir? Kefir is a fermented drink. So you have like five times the microbes in kefir than in
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=39s)** — yogurt. Plus, kefir has a combination of both bacteria and yeast, okay? It even has friendly
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=47s)** — candida. It's not until that candida turns into more of a pathogenic version that it becomes
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=54s)** — a problem. So it's a combination of these microbes that help you make serotonin. Now,
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=60s)** — serotonin is a neurotransmitter and 90% of all your serotonin is made in your own gut. But
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=69s)** — here's the thing, it doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier into the body. Instead, it can act as a
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=74s)** — precursor to help you make melatonin, which is the sleep neurotransmitter. So these
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=82s)** — microbes from kefir actually go into the body and they inoculate or seed your microbes to help you
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=89s)** — grow more microbes and actually the right balance. And the microbes from kefir actually
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=94s)** — can survive the stomach acid, whereas yogurt, it doesn't survive. Now, there's definitely
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=99s)** — benefits to yogurt because it can act like a food for certain things in your gut. But kefir
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=105s)** — actually is a probiotic, okay, that can help your gut by providing the precursor to melatonin.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=111s)** — But also it can help lower cortisol, which is the main stress hormone. And if you have that
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=118s)** — cortisol pumping through your blood, you're not going to sleep. The beneficial bacteria and yeast
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=123s)** — in kefir can help break down the protein in milk, like casein and other proteins, into
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=132s)** — a digestible protein. So even though a person has an allergy to milk, it's much less
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=138s)** — kefir because of this microbial decomposition of the protein. Also kefir tends to eat up
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=146s)** — a good portion of the lactose, the milk sugar, which many people have a problem with. They have
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=152s)** — lactose intolerance. Now, a certain strain of microbe called lactobacillus can produce a compound
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=159s)** — that is an ACE inhibitor. It's something to help relax your blood vessels to increase
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=165s)** — oxygen and blood flow through the body, which helps you sleep better. This kefir also makes B1,
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=173s)** — which is essential for reducing stress, anxiety, and building up your parasympathetic
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=182s)** — nervous system. B1 is kind of like a precursor for something called acetylcholine,
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=187s)** — which is the neurotransmitter for the parasympathetic nervous system, which is all
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=191s)** — about rest and digest. Kefir will help you absorb minerals like calcium, which is basically
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=200s)** — in this fermented milk product, as well as magnesium. So having a little calcium and even
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=205s)** — magnesium in the evening is really good for sleep. But in addition to sleep, these microbes
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=211s)** — in kefir help with a lot of other things too. It can help reduce allergies, asthma,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=217s)** — help balance your cholesterol, help with any digestive bloating or constipation,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=223s)** — and help your immune system. Now there's some updates from my previous video. Number one,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=229s)** — for those people who are on keto that are doing intermittent fasting, it might be best
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=236s)** — to consume the kefir at your last meal instead of right before bed. Even though a lot
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=241s)** — of people do it right before bed and it actually helps them. But if you're doing the
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=245s)** — fasting program, just take this at the end of your last meal. If you have the option to have
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=252s)** — either sheep or goat milk kefir, go for those. Now if you have the option to be in a certain
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=259s)** — state like California, which sells raw milk kefir, go for that. Recently I was in California
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=267s)** — and I found some raw milk kefir. It was amazing. It was without the sweeteners. It was
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=272s)** — no fruit. I think they had a little turmeric in there and cinnamon. And this was cow's milk,
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=278s)** — but it was raw. It was amazing. And if you can't find raw milk kefir, you might want to consider
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=284s)** — making your own from raw milk. I do it occasionally and what you would do is you
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=290s)** — have a couple options. You're going to buy the starter. It's kind of like a kefir grain
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=294s)** — and you're going to add that in a certain amount to the milk, either cow's milk,
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=298s)** — sheep milk or goat milk. And then you have an option of keeping the lid either open or closed.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=303s)** — Now if you keep it open, you'll put some like cloth over it or some type of netting or you
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=309s)** — just make it closed. Now each of those methods create a slightly different effect on this kefir.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=315s)** — When you keep the lid open, okay, you provide more air. You support the aerobic microbial
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=322s)** — growth versus the lid closed, which you're supporting the anaerobic microbial growth.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=329s)** — And anytime you provide more air to fermentation, you get more of a yeast growth, a hint of
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=336s)** — sourdough bread, but less sour. Whereas the anaerobic, where the lid is closed,
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=342s)** — it's going to be more sour because of the lactic acid. So when you go out and get kefir,
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=346s)** — don't get the low fat, get the whole milk, get the plain version. And you might just find
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=352s)** — sleeping so much better. Now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=357s)** — on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's a lot of content
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBOSZVKpNM&t=362s)** — that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately. So to make sure you have full access of all my
