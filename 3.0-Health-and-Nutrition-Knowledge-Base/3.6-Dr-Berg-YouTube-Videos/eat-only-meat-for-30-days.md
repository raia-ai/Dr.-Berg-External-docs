- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=0s)** — Now, out of all the nuts, walnuts have something called ALA. That stands for alpha-linoleic
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=6s)** — acid, which is a precursor to EPA and DHA, which are the omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=14s)** — But ALA itself has some unique benefits. For your skin, it can actually help prevent scaly
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=21s)** — skin, dermatitis, hyperpigmentation of the skin, where you have dark blotches through the skin.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=27s)** — It's also been known to prevent skin atrophy. And of course, if it converts to the more powerful
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=33s)** — forms of omega-3, it can help a lot of things like your heart, inflammation, brain health,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=39s)** — and the list goes on and on and on. But you have to realize that only a percentage of ALA
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=44s)** — converts to EPA and DHA. So to convert to EPA, it's roughly about between 10 to 21 percent.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=51s)** — And then converting to DHA, we're only getting between five to nine percent. Also,
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=56s)** — some interesting studies that show benefits for your cardiovascular system. Yeah, seven out of
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=62s)** — eight of the studies showed benefits to the endothelial wall of the inside of your arteries.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=69s)** — Now realize these studies were not on a lot of people. So, you know, it's a correlation,
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=74s)** — but it's not proof that it can actually help your heart. Also, it was shown that there was
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=78s)** — shift from small particle size LDL to large particle size LDL. And walnuts have folate,
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=88s)** — vitamin E, polyphenols, and they're low in lysine and high in arginine. Now,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=95s)** — arginine can help increase growth hormone. It can help rid excess ammonia. So it's involved
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=101s)** — in the urea cycle. Also, arginine can increase nitric oxide, which is good for blood pressure
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=108s)** — and cardiovascular health. Here's the problem with walnuts. Most people eat them raw, and they
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=114s)** — have phytates, sometimes even more than grains, and they have enzyme inhibitors. So they can
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=121s)** — create bloating. However, the solution is to germinate the walnuts. So you'd soak them in
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=128s)** — between 24 and 48 hours, and that will remove the phytates as well as the enzyme inhibitors.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=134s)** — Of course, you're going to have to dry them out in the oven under low heats or a dehydrator.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=139s)** — But the problem with phytates is that phytates block certain minerals like zinc, iron,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=145s)** — magnesium. So our bodies can tolerate a certain amount of phytates, but if we're
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=149s)** — consuming too much, that can create a problem with the mineral absorption, as well as our
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=154s)** — Now, as far as the enzyme inhibitors, it can inhibit pepsin, which is involved in protein
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=160s)** — digestion in your stomach. It can also inhibit amylase, which has to do with
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=165s)** — carbohydrate metabolism, as well as inhibiting trypsin in your small intestine. And this
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=171s)** — is why if you eat too many nuts, you're going to feel kind of bloated, and you might
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=175s)** — have constipation. However, if you germinate the nuts, you'll have much less problem. Now,
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=184s)** — organic walnuts, and it's a really good brand, but I consume these after a meal,
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=189s)** — and they're quite delicious. And they don't create the bloating that normal walnuts can
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=194s)** — create. But apparently they germinate these for about 48 hours. And I'm going to I'll
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=199s)** — put a link down below because when I find a good quality product that people work hard
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=204s)** — at creating, I promote it. Now one little point, I would only recommend the plain,
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=209s)** — not the other ones, because the other ones have, I think, some honey, which I don't recommend.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=215s)** — Now, if you haven't seen my other video I did on pistachios,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXd86RvNzZA&t=218s)** — let me put that up right here. Check it out.
