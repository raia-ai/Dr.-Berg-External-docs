- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=0s)** — So today I'm going to show you a remedy that can very quickly get rid of the cravings to not just alcohol but sugar as well.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=10s)** — So when someone craves alcohol, what is it that they're looking for?
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=14s)** — Well, it has something to do with reducing stress, anxiety, pressure in the body, right?
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=21s)** — It gives them this sense of relief. Same thing with sugar. Sugar makes people feel better, right?
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=26s)** — But it comes with a little bit of a package, which I'm not going to get into in this video.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=30s)** — But I'm going to tell you one simple thing that you can take to very quickly get rid of the cravings,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=38s)** — especially if you're in the situation where you're basically addicted.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=40s)** — And that substance is something called L-glutamine, okay?
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=45s)** — But it's very important to understand why L-glutamine will work for this problem.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=49s)** — Now, glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in your entire body, okay?
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=57s)** — And glutamine turns into glutamate, which is the most abundant neurotransmitter in your brain.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=65s)** — When we think about neurotransmitters, you probably think about serotonin, dopamine,
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=69s)** — things like that. People don't think of glutamate as a neurotransmitter, but it is.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=74s)** — It's the most abundant neurotransmitter in your brain. And without getting in too deep
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=78s)** — into the woods, glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter, okay?
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=83s)** — Others are inhibitory. And there is a problem when you have too much glutamate.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=88s)** — It can create kind of a toxic effect, actually giving you anxiety, depression,
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=94s)** — insomnia, things like that. But the way that it really works in the brain,
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=97s)** — there's a whole system going on. And so the glutamate actually helps support
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=102s)** — an inhibitory neurotransmitter called GABA, which is like the brakes.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=106s)** — So when your body is in a healthy state, you have this nice balance of the accelerator
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=111s)** — and the brakes. So you really don't have to worry about it. But the amino acid L-glutamine
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=116s)** — actually increases gluconeogenesis. That's the production of new sugar.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=122s)** — So that amino acid actually can very easily and quickly turn into glucose and feed your
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=130s)** — brain cells and make them happy without the side effects of like sugar. Your insulin will
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=136s)** — not spike because it's coming through a different pathway. It's coming from an amino acid,
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=141s)** — not a stray glucose. So it's a quick way to supply energy to the brain without all the
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=148s)** — bad stuff, satisfying the lack of fuel, changing your mood very quickly, reducing stress,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=156s)** — pressure, anxiety, and decreasing the need for alcohol or sugar. But glutamate does a lot more
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=163s)** — than just what I mentioned. It also is the precursor for glutathione, which is the main
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=170s)** — antioxidant in your liver. It supports the cells of your intestines, helping prevent leaky gut.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=178s)** — It is a very essential precursor to help heal the body when you're going through an infection,
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=185s)** — recovery, surgery, trauma, or stress. You need more glutamine in your body. Now what causes
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=192s)** — deficiency is alcohol. So alcohol blocks this glutamine, okay, and all the good effects that
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=199s)** — come with it. You can imagine if you're drinking on a regular basis over a period of time,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=203s)** — you're just depleting your glutamine and glutamate and setting yourself up for all sorts
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=208s)** — of problems down the road. Now the other thing that causes a major deficiency of glutamine
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=214s)** — is chronic stress. When you're under chronic stress, you actually get an increase
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=221s)** — of glutamate in a part of your brain called the hippocampus, creating all sorts of problems with
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=226s)** — memory and learning. But in the frontal cortex, we have a decrease of glutamate,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=234s)** — and that's going to affect your attention. You'll probably develop attention deficit
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=238s)** — problems. In another part of your brain, it's called the amygdala, which is very similar to
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=244s)** — your adrenal gland because it's everything to do with stress and stress responses, but it's
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=250s)** — your brain. You have a decrease of glutamate from chronic stress in the amygdala, giving you the
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=256s)** — sensation of anxiety. Another thing that can cause a deficiency of glutamine is over training,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=263s)** — like an exercising too much without letting yourself recover, having trauma, any trauma,
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=267s)** — surgery, injury, things like that, a chronic infection. And let's say you're just not
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=273s)** — consuming enough glutamine in your diet. Now what foods are high in glutamine? Well,
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=278s)** — you have beef, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy. Okay. You also have cabbage, dark leafy green
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=286s)** — vegetables, kale, spinach, parsley. If you want to get rid of the cravings for alcohol and
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=292s)** — sugar, okay. Of course, I'm assuming you've already tried the ketogenic diet and intermittent
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=297s)** — fasting, which will ultimately correct it, but you might need something to handle the cravings
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=302s)** — quickly so you can actually do the ketogenic plan. And so I recommend taking between two
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=308s)** — five grams per day. So by taking this in a supplement form, making sure you're eating
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=314s)** — the foods high in glutamine, which basically is a ketogenic diet, you can really start to pull
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=319s)** — yourself out of this situation. There are other things that can also help this whole glutamate
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=324s)** — cycle. Regular exercise without over training, getting enough sleep and doing whatever you can
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=330s)** — to reduce stress will greatly help. And the less alcohol you drink, the less deficiency
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=337s)** — you'll have. Now to ultimately fully correct this problem, you need to be on the healthy version
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D6lMQz8wTw&t=343s)** — of the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting. And for that information, check this video out
