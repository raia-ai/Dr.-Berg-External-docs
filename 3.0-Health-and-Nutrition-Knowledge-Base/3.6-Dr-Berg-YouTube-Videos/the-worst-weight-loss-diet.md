- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=0s)** — Today we are going to discuss the seven worst diets. Number one. Here we go. The junk food
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=5s)** — ingredient version of the Atkins diet. And they also have these little shakes right here. Okay.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=10s)** — I mean, let's just take a look at the ingredients of the Atkins shake. The first one is milk
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=16s)** — protein concentrate, soy protein isolates. Then of course we get the vegetable oil, canola,
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=22s)** — soybean oil, artificial flavoring. And let's see if there's anything different in the Atkins bars.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=28s)** — First ingredient soy protein isolate. And then we get poly dextrose. Then it's sweetened with
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=33s)** — something called sucralose. That's 600 times more sweet than sugar. So at one time the Atkins diet
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=38s)** — was pretty good. I think it became very corrupted, unfortunately. Number two. Jenny Craig.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=45s)** — Now Jenny Craig, you also have these pre-made meals. They have something called the Anytime
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=49s)** — Bar. And the first ingredient is, you guessed it, soy protein isolate. Second ingredient is the
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=56s)** — milk protein that a lot of people are allergic to and that's highly processed from China.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=62s)** — It has eight grams of sugar per serving. It has rice flour. And then you can actually also
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=66s)** — buy a bag of popcorn, right? Only 140 calories, 16 grams of carbs. And then you have, of
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=72s)** — course, the Asian style chicken, which is loaded with potato flour, cornstarch, modified
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=78s)** — food starch, and maltodextrin with 11 grams of sugar. You can also consume barbecue chips.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=84s)** — It's only 120 calories, 18 grams of sugar. I have a question. Why are they putting
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=91s)** — alter process food ingredients in diet foods? Let's move on to the next one.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=99s)** — Weight Watchers. Now Weight Watchers is not doing too well financially right now. This
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=104s)** — is why they're trying other things like adding in weight loss medication because their
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=108s)** — diet is not working. It's all based on portion control. Their new brand called Smart
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=113s)** — You can get a chicken pasta dish. If you look at the ingredients, wheat flour, wheat gluten,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=120s)** — then we have maltodextrin, then we have soy protein isolates, soybean oil, because what's
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=125s)** — being identified is the same ingredients in junk food, okay, aka alter process ingredients.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=133s)** — All right, next one on list number four, Nutrisystem. Okay, claims to be diabetic
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=138s)** — friendly, so it must be good. Let's see what the ingredients are. Well, we got milk,
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=142s)** — protein concentrate, corn syrup, sugar, polydextrose that keeps coming up, maltodextrin
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=149s)** — on the glycemic index, table sugar is about 65, maltodextrin can go up to 185. It's like
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=156s)** — way the heck up there. Then we have wheat flour, sugar, corn flour, corn syrup,
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=162s)** — modified cornstarch. Let's go to number five. Maybe this one will be a little bit better.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=167s)** — Ideal protein. Okay, now in practice, I had a lot of people come in after doing ideal protein,
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=174s)** — which it's not ideal. I'll tell you right now. Wheat protein isolates. These are just
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=179s)** — different names for starch. Okay, starch. And what's a starch? A starch is basically
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=185s)** — a chain of sugars. Okay, and they behave just like sugar. So anytime I'm mentioning
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=192s)** — maltodextrin, modified food starch, and these flowers, just think sugars because that's what
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=198s)** — they really are. They also have another one called fluffy vanilla crisp. Okay, you can do
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=203s)** — this on ideal protein, the same ingredients over and over and over. Number six is Optifast.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=211s)** — This is the medically supervised diet program. You go to an obesity doctor and he'll put you
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=217s)** — Optifast. It's science based, so we know it must be legitimate, nutritionally complete,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=223s)** — excellent source of protein, meal replacement, you just do five servings a day,
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=227s)** — and you'll just lose a lot of weight. They have three main types of food. You got the shakes,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=234s)** — you have the bars, and you have the soups. So the chocolate shake, you guessed it, contains
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=240s)** — maltodextrin as the first ingredient, and then it has the milk protein, and then the soy
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=245s)** — protein isolate, and then the seed oil, the canola oil. So anytime you have like a lot of
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=249s)** — carbs and maybe lower sugars and no fiber, what you're going to be left with is starches.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=255s)** — Okay, just think about starches as sugar because in this area right here, it's basically sugar.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=261s)** — And then we get to the last one, which is Medifast. Okay, Medifast went into business,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=266s)** — if I'm not mistaken, or at least they had a lawsuit, but this is a scientifically designed
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=271s)** — program. You do six servings a day. So you have the one called the Essential Chocolate Mint
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=277s)** — Cookie Crisp Bar. Sounds pretty delicious. Take a while to guess what the ingredients are.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=283s)** — Soy protein isolates, sugar, polydextrose, soluble corn fiber, brown rice syrup,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=289s)** — milk protein isolates, which is that casein again, and rice starch. This totally goes
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=297s)** — against this concept that I put out, which is it's not lose weight to get healthy. It's
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=301s)** — get healthy to lose weight. If you use these ingredients to lose weight, you are literally
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=306s)** — setting yourself up to destroy your metabolism. They're going to stimulate cravings for the
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=310s)** — wrong things. They're highly addictive. And these ingredients are at the bottom of the
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=314s)** — barrel. They're not even considered food. They don't really improve energy or life or
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=319s)** — any type of health at all. But they are the prime number one contributors to diabetes,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=327s)** — obesity. And they're in these diet shakes, soups, bars, and prepackaged foods. These are
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=335s)** — also the same ingredients that they use for institutional foods like the foods in prisons,
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=340s)** — the foods in nursing homes, the foods in hospitals. These are cheap ingredients,
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=345s)** — long shelf life, super profitable. Now, if you notice, I didn't talk about the vegan diet or
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=351s)** — vegetarians or keto or carnivore, because people can lose weight on these other diets,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=356s)** — especially if they're using whole foods. But anytime we do a diet with alter process food
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=361s)** — calories, whether they're meshed into this so called keto plan, or they're meshed into
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=370s)** — the vegan fake meats, you're going to have problems losing weight and you're going to
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=374s)** — have problems with your health. To keep this really, really simple, if you're interested
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=378s)** — in losing weight, you really need to read the ingredients because you're going to find that
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=384s)** — some of these keto products, just because they say they're keto, are not really keto.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=388s)** — Like this one right here. This is Duncan Hines. Okay, it says keto friendly,
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=394s)** — two net carbs. Okay, it might be keto, but it's not healthy keto. Because if you look at the
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=402s)** — ingredients, guess what it has? Modified tapioca starch, resistant dextrin, which we really
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=411s)** — don't know the long term studies of consuming that ingredient would do for our microbiome.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=416s)** — But other than that, there's some good stuff in here, but they had to ruin it with those few
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5ThlWuYaw&t=420s)** — ingredients.
