- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=0s)** — Now, someone had a question on one of my comments relating to bugs because...
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=5s)** — A recent report says insects are the future of food.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=8s)** — Bugs for dinner? Acing insects?
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=11s)** — They want us to all eat bugs by 2050 because of the rise of population. We'll be roughly about
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=18s)** — maybe nine billion people on this planet. So how are we going to feed them? I mean,
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=21s)** — everyone knows this fact because the climate change and beef is not sustainable. We need
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=26s)** — to find other sources of food. I like to say my life's mission is to breed a bug that tastes like
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=31s)** — bacon. And yes, they even say the grass-fed regenerative farming type agriculture needs
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=36s)** — to go because of all the cow burping and the methane and what that does to the environment
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=40s)** — because that's the big problem. And one of the big solutions would be the bugs because they're
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=44s)** — so high in protein and they're so nutrient dense. Well, let's do a little breakdown of
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=49s)** — topic because if we take a hundred grams of these bugs, in this hundred grams we have about
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=57s)** — 12 grams of actual protein and there's about five grams of fat, five grams of carbs,
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=62s)** — little iron, a little tiny bit of fat. But is 12 grams enough for our bodies?
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=67s)** — Actually, no. If we do the math and look at the actual number of crickets that we're
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=71s)** — gonna have to eat to get close to this protein, we're gonna have to 4x that. That's
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=77s)** — big. But for a lot of people, they're gonna need to 8x that figure every single day to get
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=83s)** — their protein amount. I guess we can mash them up and put them into pizzas and with all these
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=88s)** — other different flavorings. We can put them in burgers, sweeten them, and that might be a
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=92s)** — solution. But what about the cost? It's gonna be quite expensive, right? But they can bring
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=98s)** — the cost down by feeding the crickets cheaper materials like maybe corn, soy, beet sugar,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=104s)** — something like that. The problem with that is the nutrition comes down, you know, and then the
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=108s)** — protein level comes down. And that's one little issue. Quite expensive to have healthy insects
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=115s)** — to eat. Okay? Number two, we're gonna have to get everyone to give up their traditional
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=119s)** — cultural foods. And that might take some work. I think that the first bite is the hardest.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=125s)** — And then after that, people go, well, they taste pretty good. Oh, the crunch. Number
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=131s)** — three, and this is probably the biggest one. When you compare an insect with beef, it's not the
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=138s)** — same. For anyone to say that it's identical, they're lying through their teeth, it's not
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=142s)** — even close. And I'm not just talking about the protein. I'm talking about the quality
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=146s)** — of protein. I'm talking about the nutrition, all these other factors that is in beef that is
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=152s)** — not in crickets. So don't buy into the it's the same thing. Number four, insects carry
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=157s)** — So there's one study in 2019 that evaluated quite a few cricket farms that were developing
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=164s)** — edible crickets. And 81% of them had parasites. 30% were potentially pathogenic. There's also a
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=172s)** — higher incidence of worms in crickets and viruses and bacteria and funguses. Then we
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=178s)** — have the safety studies, right? We have to do all that. Then we're gonna have to probably
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=182s)** — and cook these insects to kill off the microbes. But then we're also going to kill off a lot of
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=188s)** — the nutrition as well. There's this unregulated field of using pesticides on these insects.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=194s)** — So you can use different chemicals to kind of manage some of these other factors that are
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=202s)** — can be growing in these bugs. Then the next thing is that if someone has an allergy to
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=207s)** — Okay, because there's a similar protein involved, chances are they'll also have an allergy to bugs
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=213s)** — if they start consuming them. And then the next factor is that these bugs have this exoskeleton.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=219s)** — It's like bones outside their body. And the main compound in there is called chitin. It's
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=227s)** — an anti-nutrient. It's not digested by our microbiome. And it also blocks vitamin A and
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=233s)** — And so this is just another negative. And so now we're doing another human pilot experiment
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=239s)** — that will put people on bugs and then see what happens after years. My viewpoint on the future
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=245s)** — of food being bugs does not look like it's going to happen. There are too many negative
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=250s)** — points about this. Now, if you want to know what I think you should be eating right now
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=254s)** — to regain your health and be super healthy, I think it's probably the most healthy food
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROt0Xgr8QE&t=259s)** — you can eat. It's right here. Check it out.
