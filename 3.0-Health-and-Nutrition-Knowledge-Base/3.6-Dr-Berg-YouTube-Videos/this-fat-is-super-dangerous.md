- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=0s)** — Let's talk about how to get rid of your belly fat. But if we just kind of step back for a second and
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=5s)** — just look at the purpose of fat, it's a survival mechanism. It helps to store fuel, but it has a
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=14s)** — limitation to how much it can store. So once it gets to a certain point, then we have a backup
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=21s)** — system. It's a plan B where you start storing fat around the organs and that type of fat is
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=28s)** — visceral fat. Now when visceral fat goes on too long and you don't use up that energy, then that
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=35s)** — type of fat becomes sick. It becomes damaged and it can no longer readily take in fats for storage
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=44s)** — or even sugar in its conversion into fat. So we have a third type of fat situation. This is
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=51s)** — fat that then spills over inside your organs. It's the fat inside your liver. It's the fat
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=59s)** — inside your pancreas. It's the fat inside your muscle. So by the time you have ectopic fat,
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=65s)** — which is fat in the liver, that's actually pretty bad. That's not a healthy situation.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=70s)** — But on a positive note, it's the fastest thing to fix because when we reverse the
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=75s)** — can get rid of the ectopic fat first, then the visceral fat, then the subcutaneous fat.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=83s)** — And so is it just a matter of too many calories that destroys the machine? Not necessarily. It's
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=88s)** — the type of calories that destroy this machine. Number one, alcohol will destroy the machine for
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=93s)** — sure. This is why chronic alcoholics have a pot belly and they have a lot of visceral fat
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=98s)** — and they definitely have a lot of liver fat. Now the next thing you need to know about is
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=103s)** — Now there's a big difference between the fructose in fruit versus the fructose in high fructose
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=110s)** — corn syrup. That goes into the body and just creates serious damage to your metabolism,
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=115s)** — including the liver because it's a refined product. It's an ultra processed food that
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=120s)** — doesn't have the protection. So when you eat these carbohydrates without those cofactors,
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=125s)** — as in the ultra processed food calories, you really starve off this biochemical machine.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=131s)** — And this is really what causes the system to break down because over 83% of the food
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=137s)** — calories in the grocery store are ultra processed food calories. The next thing I want to share
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=142s)** — with you is something that doesn't involve food. It involves stress. Chronic stress can also
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=148s)** — activate the body and turn things into sugar inside your body. And Cushing syndrome is created
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=156s)** — by a high level cortisol. That's the stress hormone. Even getting less than five hours
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=161s)** — of sleep a night can increase cortisol and worsen more visceral fat. Steroids, also
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=168s)** — antibiotics, antidepressant medication, anti-anxiety medication can also increase
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=174s)** — visceral fat. Now another uncommon thing that people don't realize is the seed oils
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=178s)** — in our diet, which make up like 25-30%, directly contribute to damage mitochondria,
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=186s)** — that machine that controls our metabolism. Because even if you look at the past two or three
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=191s)** — or four decades and you look at the trends of sugar, they're not nearly as high as the seed
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=197s)** — oils. There's much more contribution to visceral fat from seed oils than actual sugar. So this
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=205s)** — is another thing that unfortunately people have been taught that seed oils are heart healthy,
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=211s)** — when in fact they're heart unhealthy. They go through an industrial refining process and when
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=218s)** — you consume them they're just very damaging to the system. And then of course you have sugar
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=222s)** — and starch. But the damaging effect from sugar and starch happens when you refine
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=228s)** — sugars and starches through this whole industrial process. So glucose syrup, dextrose, these are
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=234s)** — sugars that are highly refined. Starch is basically a sugar. I'm talking about maltodextrin,
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=240s)** — I'm talking about modified food starch and they're very deadly for your metabolism
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=244s)** — and they contribute to a lot of visceral fat and damage within the machine. So what do we do
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=250s)** — as the first step? Eliminate alter process food calories. Sugar, starches and seed oils. If you
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=258s)** — combine the seed oils with the sugar, oh my goodness, you're going to really severely damage
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=264s)** — that metabolism because your system is already gunked up. This is what's called metabolically
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=269s)** — inefficient. And a lot of these alter process food calories don't have a lot of protein in
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=274s)** — them. The protein is what satisfies you. Without protein you're just going to want more and
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=278s)** — more and more. You'll keep eating them until you're satisfied with protein. Well that's
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=283s)** — never going to happen. Like animal proteins, especially red meat, are so dense in the
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=287s)** — cofactors. I'm talking about the trace minerals, the minerals and the vitamins that
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=291s)** — need to actually metabolize. Red meat, fish, eggs, all will help you fix this problem.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=298s)** — Another thing that people don't realize is that diet sodas are just as bad as regular
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=302s)** — sugar sodas. So don't think you're helping yourself by taking a diet soda. And I just
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=308s)** — have to say this one last point. Just because something says low carb or keto-friendly
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=313s)** — does not mean it's really keto-friendly. So you must read the labels. As far as exercise
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=319s)** — goes, what type of exercise is best for belly fat? Well, let's just first talk about
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=324s)** — high intensity interval training. Because it's short doses of high intensity with rest
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=330s)** — versus a sustained long-term run or a moderate amount of intensity on a treadmill. And that
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=338s)** — can even increase cortisol. So if you do high intensity interval training, you'll be more
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=343s)** — successful with visceral fat. But also other things like weight training are going to build
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=347s)** — more muscles so then you can actually burn more of these calories. You need muscle to have this
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=352s)** — whole thing work. But then we get to walking. Walking is very good for belly fat loss, but not
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=360s)** — just a little bit of walking a day. Like doing longer walks because walking also reduces stress.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=367s)** — So this is why I like the combination of high intensity interval training with walking on the
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=376s)** — And I also take B1. A good source of B1 is something called nutritional yeast. You can
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=383s)** — put it on your salad, make sure it's unfortified, and that can greatly help reduce stress and
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=388s)** — increase sleep. Next thing on the list is vitamin D through a lot of sun. Getting more sun
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=392s)** — will help you lose more weight. Just don't go out into the point where you're burned.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=397s)** — Go out to the point where you start developing a tan and getting more vitamin D. And in those
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=402s)** — days you can't get sun. Just take vitamin D as a supplement. At least 10,000 I use the vitamin D3.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=409s)** — But don't forget about magnesium because magnesium also allows vitamin D to work.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=414s)** — Magnesium also helps you sleep. It's also very important in making sure that the mitochondria
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=419s)** — works well since magnesium is one of the top co-factors or the helper things involved
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=425s)** — in that mitochondrial biochemistry. And the last point is fasting. And this is really
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=432s)** — up greatly because every time you eat you trigger insulin. And the more insulin you have,
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=438s)** — the less you're going to lose. So if you can include intermittent fasting and only
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=441s)** — have two meals, lunch and dinner, and then kind of graduate maybe even to one meal for a
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=446s)** — while, that would probably be very, very smart versus all the snacking that people do.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=452s)** — And even if it's healthy snacking, probably not a good idea. But this is a way
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=456s)** — to actually fix the metabolism to the point where now you have the ability to use fuel
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=463s)** — because now you're matching an environment of how your body has evolved. And the body has not
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=469s)** — evolved with all this available food and snacking and eating constantly 24-7. Now the
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=476s)** — biggest question is what are the details of what do I eat? For that information, watch this
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EWt8jyX2E&t=481s)** — right here.
