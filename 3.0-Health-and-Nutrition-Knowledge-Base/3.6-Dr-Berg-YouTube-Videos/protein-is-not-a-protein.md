- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=0s)** — You know, a protein is not really a protein. Now, what am I talking about? A protein is not a protein.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=6s)** — There's a few confusions related to this topic that I want to clear up because I keep running into
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=12s)** — them over and over and over. The first one relates to protein requirements, okay? So, typically,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=19s)** — the minimum requirement of protein that you need per day on average is like 50 grams. Now,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=25s)** — the formula for that, which can cause this number to vary, is like 0.821 grams of protein per
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=33s)** — your kilogram weight, your body weight. Here's where the confusion lies. Let's take a beef steak,
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=42s)** — okay? You get 100 grams of this beef steak, which is about 3.5 ounces. And so, here you are
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=50s)** — going to eat the steak, 100 grams, and you're thinking, wow, I'm getting double the amount that
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=56s)** — I really need, right? Now, because there's two things. We have the weight of the steak, okay?
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=62s)** — And then you have the amount of protein in the steak. Two different things because the
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=67s)** — actual protein in that beef is only 26 grams, not 100 grams. And now you're saying,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=72s)** — well, wait a second, I thought it's kind of just pure protein, isn't it? Like, no.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=77s)** — There's some fat in there and the rest of it is not carbs. The rest of it is mainly
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=83s)** — water, okay? Water weight. That's what it is. It has a lot of water weight in it. This is why
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=88s)** — when you freeze dry a steak, it's like paper. It's really light. But the point is, when
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=92s)** — you're dealing with these protein requirements, we're not talking about the actual weight of the
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=98s)** — food. We're talking about the protein in that food. So, that's clarification number one. The
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=104s)** — next confusion and very important thing to know is that one protein varies with other proteins
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=113s)** — in the amount of amino acids that they have as far as the quality and the ratios. So,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=120s)** — in other words, we really don't have a requirement for protein at all. We have a
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=126s)** — requirement for the amino acids in those proteins. And that's important because when
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=131s)** — you're looking at labels, it doesn't tell you the amino acids. It just says the total protein.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=136s)** — When we're talking about the ketogenic diet, it says you need 20% protein, okay? But again,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=143s)** — no one's talking about the amino acids. And the problem lies in the quality of protein
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=149s)** — or the bioavailable amino acids in protein food that you eat. It is a huge difference
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=155s)** — between animal protein and plant protein. The absolute best bioavailable protein is breast milk,
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=165s)** — but that's usually not available. So, the second one is eggs and then meat and chicken
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=170s)** — and then dairy. And then way down the list, you get all these plant proteins. So,
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=178s)** — some of the problem with plant proteins is they have all eight essential amino acids,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=182s)** — but certain ones are very, very, very tiny. Okay, like leucine, for example. Leucine is
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=188s)** — essential to grow muscles. And if you're living on plant-based proteins, you're not going to
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=193s)** — get a lot of leucine and your muscles are going to suffer. Let's take wheat protein,
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=198s)** — which by the way is like 80% of all the plant-based protein comes from wheat. Very
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=204s)** — low in leucine, lysine, and methionine. But it's protein, right? Now, how can you
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=209s)** — compensate with that? Well, just eat more of it, right? Well, the problem is if you eat more of
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=214s)** — it, you're going to get more carbs, okay? Especially if you're doing like whole plant
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=220s)** — foods. I mean, if you're going to ask me, like if you want to be a vegan and you want to
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=224s)** — have foods that are high in protein, what foods would they be? I mean, that's really
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=228s)** — hard because there is no vegan food that's just a very high concentrated protein. There's some
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=235s)** — protein in nuts. There's some protein in soy. There's some protein in grains, but there's also
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=242s)** — a good amount of carbs. So as you increase the protein, you increase the carbs and it bumps you
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=247s)** — completely out of keto. Now, I had someone on my show bring up this really interesting question
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=252s)** — about... she's a vegetarian and she has gut issues and she wants to solve this problem.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=260s)** — Now, I already know if you're doing keto, which she's trying to do, and you have problems with
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=267s)** — your gut, you should probably go carnivore. Well, that's a little conflicting if you're
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=271s)** — trying to be a vegetarian or a vegan. However, thank goodness she's a vegetarian, not a vegan,
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=276s)** — because at least she can do eggs. And that's what I told her to do. It is not easy to do
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=281s)** — keto on a vegan or a vegetarian diet simply because now you're going to have to start
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=285s)** — foods that are refined, like even refined protein powders. It's so interesting to me to see these
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=293s)** — vegan protein powders and they call them clean protein versus what? Dirty animal protein,
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=300s)** — because it's dirty. What about the grass-fed grass-finished animal protein? That's pretty
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=305s)** — darn clean and it's complete. The plant-based protein doesn't even come close to the quality
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=311s)** — protein that your body needs, especially if you're younger and you're growing child.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=317s)** — If you feed a very small child certain foods without enough of the right amino acids,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=324s)** — it can stunt their growth. And so I asked this lady, I said, why did you become a
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=329s)** — vegetarian? She goes, well, my whole life I was a vegetarian because I just can't eat me
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=334s)** — because it hurts my stomach. I'm like, wow, that's interesting. Our bodies naturally have a
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=340s)** — very acidic stomach. So acidic, like between one and three, that's close to battery acid.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=346s)** — We should be able to digest protein very easily unless the pH has gone up and has become
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=351s)** — a weaker acid. And now we can't tolerate animal proteins, especially. So one big clue
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=359s)** — of having not enough acid or maybe a weaker stomach acid is the intolerance of meat. You
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=365s)** — just can't digest meat. You reject red meat, especially. So I told her, I said,
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=372s)** — I think we can solve your problem. Are you adverse to consuming animal products
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=377s)** — if your body can digest them? And she says, no. I said, good, start taking betaine hydrochloride.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=382s)** — Start taking maybe two with a meal, three, four, five, and keep adding them slowly.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=388s)** — And then see what happens in a few weeks. I bet you it's going to acidify your stomach.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=391s)** — You'll be able to digest the protein and problem solved. So all of our food never comes as one
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=397s)** — macro, like just pure carbohydrates or pure fats or pure protein, unless you refine them.
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=403s)** — All foods come in combinations. And when you're looking at protein requirements,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=408s)** — it's really the amino acid profile or protein inside that food. And if you're doing like a
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=414s)** — plant-based protein and you're deficient in some of these amino acids, the two big
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=418s)** — symptoms that you're going to experience are number one, fatigue or lethargy.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=423s)** — And number two, your mood is going to drop. But unfortunately, people are using more
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=430s)** — plant-based proteins, a lot of soy protein, and it's messing up their digestion. It's
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=436s)** — affecting their mood. It's affecting their ability to generate energy. I mean, if you look
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=440s)** — at at least the U.S., you know, as far as plant-based, we're already at 60% plant-based
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=449s)** — proteins. Of course, in the form of cereals, which have other carbs. But the point is that
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=454s)** — we're doing a lot of grains, legumes, tubers, things like that. I think the percentage of
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=461s)** — animal meat is like 35%. So I just want to clear up a few of these really important
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=465s)** — points. If you have a small child or a grandchild, right, and you're shifting them
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=471s)** — onto food from breastfeeding, unfortunately, a lot of these purees or these toddler foods or
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=479s)** — these infant formula type foods are just loaded with soy and these so-called healthy,
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=486s)** — clean plant proteins, which is going to create a lot of problems in their digestion.
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=490s)** — I did find a company that I'm going to recommend to you if you need it for your toddler. It's
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=497s)** — called Serenity Kids. I've never contacted this company. I have no affiliation, but I am just
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=503s)** — blown away at the quality of these products that they use in these little pouches. They're
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=508s)** — using like meats from wonderful farms where they have like transparency and they have,
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=514s)** — they put squash in there and vegetables and bone broth. So it's an awesome product. And I'll
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=519s)** — link down below if you have a grandchild or child that might need something better than
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=524s)** — what they have out there, like in the baby food where they have just applesauce or cereals and
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=530s)** — just terrible. The next time you read a label it says protein. Now you know that there's
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=535s)** — more to that protein than meets the eye. Now I have another video that's a bit more detailed
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=541s)** — into this protein requirements and giving you examples of other types of proteins.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fR5nVsGlk0&t=547s)** — And I put that up right here. You can check it out.
