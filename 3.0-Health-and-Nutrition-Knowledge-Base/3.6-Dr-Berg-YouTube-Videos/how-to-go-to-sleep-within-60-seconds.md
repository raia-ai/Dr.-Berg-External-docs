- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=0s)** — I want to share with you a very interesting, powerful technique
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=4s)** — to be able to go to sleep within minutes.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=7s)** — But first I want to kind of remove some of the
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=9s)** — other things that can interfere with this technique.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=12s)** — Number one, overtraining. If you're exercising too much
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=15s)** — your sympathetic nervous system will go up
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=17s)** — and that will keep your adrenaline high
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=20s)** — and you will not be able to go to sleep.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=21s)** — For some people, the best
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=23s)** — high intensity interval training exercise
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=26s)** — should be done maybe
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=28s)** — twice a week versus even every other day.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=31s)** — That can keep someone up.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=32s)** — Also, if your room is a little too hot
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=35s)** — that can interfere with your ability to sleep.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=37s)** — If you do a lot of carbohydrates
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=38s)** — that can deplete B1
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=41s)** — which will then keep you up at night.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=44s)** — A real simple remedy is just to take some B1
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=46s)** — right before you go to sleep. It helps so many people.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=48s)** — And you will feel like within minutes like this
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=52s)** — calmness. Vitamin B1 is essential for
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=54s)** — the parasympathetic nervous system.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=56s)** — And also it's not just the carbs that can reduce your B1
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=59s)** — it could be also stress.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=61s)** — And too much tea.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=62s)** — That caffeine is still in their system.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=65s)** — It might seem like a real simple thing
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=67s)** — but it seems to work for a lot of people.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=69s)** — If your gut microbiome is not right
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=72s)** — that will greatly interfere with your ability to sleep.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=76s)** — Kefir as a probiotic
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=78s)** — will greatly help your sleep.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=80s)** — Maybe half of a cup.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=81s)** — Not to mention giving you some calcium
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=83s)** — which also can actually help you go to sleep as well.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=85s)** — If you are insulin resistant
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=88s)** — you are not going to be able to absorb as much
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=91s)** — tryptophan from your diet
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=93s)** — turns into serotonin
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=95s)** — and then into melatonin, the sleep hormone.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=100s)** — And that could be another reason why you're not sleeping.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=103s)** — Sometimes when people do the ketogenic diet
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=105s)** — for a long period of time
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=106s)** — or even the carnivore for a long period of time
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=108s)** — your insulin level will go really low.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=111s)** — And you're going to become insulin sensitive.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=114s)** — So that means your insulin receptors are going to work really well
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=118s)** — but you might be on the low side with insulin.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=121s)** — And remember we need insulin for all sorts of things.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=123s)** — We need insulin to help us absorb more amino acids, nutrients.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=128s)** — But here's what I noticed.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=128s)** — Some people who have done the ketogenic diet
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=132s)** — for a period of time and then the sleep isn't as great
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=136s)** — will benefit from adding
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=139s)** — maybe one to two cups of berries
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=142s)** — with their last meal.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=143s)** — And that's still going to be under that 50 gram of carb.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=146s)** — So that will be enough carbs with the fiber
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=150s)** — to raise that insulin a little bit
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=153s)** — to allow more tryptophan to enter the blood-brain barrier
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=156s)** — and help you sleep a little bit better.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=158s)** — You should try it. It might help you.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=159s)** — And then you have another factor.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=161s)** — If you're deficient in sodium
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=162s)** — because maybe you're fasting, you're doing one meal a day
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=164s)** — and you're not really adding enough sodium or salt to the diet
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=168s)** — your sympathetic nervous system will have a tendency to go up.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=172s)** — And that can keep you from sleeping.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=175s)** — So a little more salt during the day
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=178s)** — helps you sleep.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=179s)** — Now I'm going to show you the technique.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=181s)** — And this is legitimate. It's an actual technique
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=183s)** — that is based on science.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=185s)** — What you're going to do is you're going to synchronize
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=188s)** — your heart to your lungs.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=191s)** — Basically we're going to
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=193s)** — breathe in a certain way
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=196s)** — to create this
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=199s)** — optimized synchronization between your heartbeat,
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=201s)** — your blood pressure
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=203s)** — and the rhythm of your breathing with your lungs.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=206s)** — And it's going to help you
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=208s)** — stimulate something called the parasympathetic
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=211s)** — which will induce a wonderful sleep.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=215s)** — So here's a secret.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=215s)** — And you might want to practice this with a timer first because
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=219s)** — it's hard to be exact.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=220s)** — But this is how you do it.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=222s)** — You want to breathe in
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=224s)** — for five and a half seconds
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=226s)** — and breathe out five and a half seconds.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=228s)** — But if you synchronize your breathing in
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=231s)** — and out at five and a half seconds each,
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=235s)** — that will give you about five and a half breaths per minute
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=238s)** — that creates this synchronization.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=241s)** — And you want to breathe through your nose.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=242s)** — You want to do it very gradually.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=244s)** — And I'm telling you,
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=246s)** — within minutes I go right out.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=248s)** — And if you haven't seen this video on more data about
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=251s)** — breathing and getting enough
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=255s)** — balance between CO2 and oxygen
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=257s)** — to pull yourself out of a panic attack,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sfl-kS9Xyg&t=260s)** — you should check this video out right here.
