- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=0s)** — There are four very common ingredients that shorten your life and kill you prematurely.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=5s)** — When I was in practice for 30 years, I really tried to get people to change their ways.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=10s)** — I tried to get them to eat healthier. But eating healthy is expensive.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=13s)** — And I would talk to people until they're blue in the face and not get anywhere.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=17s)** — And I stumbled on this when I was going to people's homes. And then we would go to the
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=21s)** — grocery store and we would, you know, teach them what to eat. And I personally had an
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=27s)** — An average person does not recognize the four ingredients in 99.999% of all junk foods.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=40s)** — The whole label on foods is just completely confusing. And no one can make any sense
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=45s)** — out of it. You're never going to understand what the food is unless you understand
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=49s)** — the ingredients in the food. It would be very similar to looking at a label in a different
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=53s)** — I mean, it just does not communicate because every single word in there is just foreign to you.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=60s)** — Now, I just want to read off some of these ingredients.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=65s)** — Hydroxypropyl Distarch phosphate, Intra-sterified soybean oil, Hydrolyzed corn oil,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=72s)** — Maltodextrin, Dextrose, Dextrin. So just ignore those words right now because
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=77s)** — you literally fall asleep if I keep talking about it. I mean, can you imagine if I
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=85s)** — were to describe these words? I'm just going to literally make you unconscious.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=90s)** — These words are chemical names for junk food ingredients and I really think they're
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=94s)** — purposely put in there just to hide what's really in there. So the junk food industry
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=100s)** — is camouflaging their ingredients. Number one. Number two, these companies have normalized
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=107s)** — junk foods as part of a regular diet. And number three, these companies spend millions of dollars
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=116s)** — to downplay the bad effects of their ingredients. To neutralize these ingredients.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=123s)** — There is no bad food group, right? I mean, that is completely created by big food. You know,
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=128s)** — as long as you're eating a balanced diet, you'll be fine. What they have done very
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=132s)** — successfully is made their ingredients the same level as other ingredients. Like a calorie
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=141s)** — from the fructose and higher fructose corn syrup is the same calories as fructose and fruit.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=146s)** — They're identical. This is absolutely, positively, a thousand percent not true.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=151s)** — Well, I'll tell you right now, there's a huge difference between the starch and vegetables
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=154s)** — and the synthetic starch they get from corn. There's also a big difference between
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=160s)** — cane sugar and then synthetic sugar like glucose syrup. Now, the other thing you need to know is
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=165s)** — that you cannot determine the quality of the food by looking at this part of the label right
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=171s)** — here called the nutritional facts. You have to read this part right here, which is really
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=177s)** — hard to read unless you have magnifying glasses. I can't even read this right here.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=182s)** — I wonder if that's on purpose or not. So there's a super simple way to identify these
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=189s)** — ingredients that are in 99.99 percent of all junk food. The first one is sugar. And I'm not
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=196s)** — even talking about sugar cane. I'm talking about the synthetic sugars. And there's a lot of
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=200s)** — different chemical names for sugar. Okay. Then you have starches. What's a starch?
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=205s)** — Starch is a sugar. Okay. And I'm not talking about the starches and vegetables. I'm talking
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=209s)** — about the synthetically made, highly processed starches. Then we have seed oils. Very, very
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=214s)** — highly processed. And then the before, we have highly processed, refined proteins.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=222s)** — Soy protein isolates. And you have casein in different forms. That's like milk protein. And
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=228s)** — by the way, there's a significant amount of casein coming from China. It's not really
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=233s)** — regulated. You have no idea how these cows are treated before they get the milk from them.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=240s)** — And so many people have allergies to casein. And you have also a type of protein that
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=246s)** — creates more inflammation called A1 beta casein. You don't want that in your body. You want the
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=251s)** — A2. And I'll guarantee all the casein protein that they use in junk foods is A1. So a lot
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=258s)** — of people get bloating when they have this concentrated casein protein. Not to mention
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=262s)** — the soy protein isolates have heavy amounts of hexane, which is a solvent. It's in gasoline.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=269s)** — And there's really no regulation or monitoring how much of that hexane is in that product.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=276s)** — And then you also have wheat gluten. I created a little card cut out. You download it, you cut
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=282s)** — it out and you put it in your wallet. And then you match it up with this card. And that way,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=286s)** — I list all the different chemical names. And that way you don't have to memorize any of
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=291s)** — the names. So out of all the things that you can change to make your health better,
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=296s)** — this is the most important. So click the link down below to download the
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQfUJRY6SQ&t=300s)** — little card so you can cut it out and put it in your wallet immediately.
