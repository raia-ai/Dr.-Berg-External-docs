- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the best meal to actually clean out your arteries.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=5s)** — And I'm talking about atherosclerotic plucking.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=9s)** — This is some new information that I think will actually blow you away.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=13s)** — And you can apply this to a lot of different body problems.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=17s)** — And since heart attacks are the number one killer,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=19s)** — I think you're going to be glad that you watch this.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=21s)** — I was studying some research involving germ-free mice
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=26s)** — because they do a lot of experiments on animals that are germ-free.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=30s)** — And like, what does this germ-free thing, right?
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=33s)** — Well, there's a way to grow an animal without any microbes living on or inside them.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=40s)** — And so they're really kind of a sterile animal.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=43s)** — And that way they can do various experiments and keep the microbiome out of the picture.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=49s)** — Now, the question is, can an animal live germ-free?
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=53s)** — Well, yes, they can survive, but I think they don't survive very well.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=57s)** — First of all, they require a lot more nutrient-dense foods to survive
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=62s)** — because they don't have the help from the microbes.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=65s)** — They have stunted growth, underdeveloped hearts, lungs, and their liver is smaller.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=70s)** — They even have low cardiac output, so their heart doesn't work as well.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=74s)** — The lining on their intestine is thinner, and they also have a lot of GI problems.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=80s)** — And their immune system doesn't develop fully, and they have a lot of inflammatory conditions.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=84s)** — And there's even atrophy of their lymph nodes.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=87s)** — But other than that, they do quite well.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=89s)** — So, now, how does this relate to your arteries?
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=92s)** — Well, I started looking into the connection between germ-free mice research
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=99s)** — and what kind of effects that can create on your arteries.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=102s)** — I wanted to see if there's any connection between this lack of microbiome or dysbiosis
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=108s)** — and your arteries. And I found all sorts of amazing, amazing data.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=113s)** — When you start to destroy the microbes in the gut, actually in mice studies,
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=116s)** — or basically have a germ-free mouse,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=119s)** — they develop a lot of inflammation throughout the entire body, including the arteries,
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=122s)** — which is the kind of the trigger of this whole cascade of effects
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=127s)** — that happens in the arteries with plucking.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=129s)** — And some people still have this concept that our blood is sterile.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=133s)** — Okay, we have no microbes in our blood. It's completely sterile. It's not.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=137s)** — There are microorganisms living in your blood.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=140s)** — In fact, there are pathogens living inside your plaque in the arteries.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=146s)** — Yes, pathogens. I'm talking about Chlamydia, H. pylori, Staphylococcus.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=152s)** — Those pathogenic microbes are living inside that plaque.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=155s)** — And you have a lot of other microbes inside the arteries, too.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=158s)** — I mean, think about how many microbes we have in our guts living on our skin.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=162s)** — Why wouldn't we have them throughout our organs? Well, we do.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=166s)** — And so apparently, if there's an imbalance in the microorganisms in our body,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=171s)** — it can lead to all sorts of problems in our arteries.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=173s)** — Now, the other piece of this puzzle that I want to bring up now is
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=176s)** — there's this one very specific important nutrient.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=180s)** — Okay, it's a vitamin that has this responsibility
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=184s)** — of keeping the calcium build up out of the arteries.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=188s)** — Because when you have plucking, you have inflammation,
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=191s)** — you have calcium and you have cholesterol plaques, right?
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=193s)** — Well, this vitamin, which you may already know, is called vitamin K2.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=197s)** — And its job is to keep the calcium out of the arteries.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=201s)** — Okay, it directs the calcium back into the bone.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=204s)** — And if you're deficient in vitamin K2,
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=206s)** — you could actually build up this calcium in the arteries.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=209s)** — Now, the reason I'm bringing up K2 is because guess what makes vitamin K2?
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=214s)** — Microbes. Your own gut makes vitamin K2.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=219s)** — It has the ability to convert the vitamin K1
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=221s)** — from leafy greens to vitamin K2.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=224s)** — Vitamin K2 is in fermented foods because the microbes,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=228s)** — the bacteria in those fermented foods can make vitamin K2.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=233s)** — Especially fatty fermented foods like fatty cheese,
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=237s)** — okay, which is a fermented product.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=240s)** — The fattier the cheese, the more vitamin K2 you're going to get.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=243s)** — And other fatty things too, like fatty meats.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=246s)** — You can get it from salmon, salami, which is a fermented product.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=250s)** — Certain sausages, especially fatty pork sausage,
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=254s)** — has vitamin K2.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=256s)** — Up to five times other types of sausage.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=260s)** — Even certain hot dogs and even bacon can have K2 in it.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=264s)** — Now, of course, you also have sauerkraut
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=266s)** — is loaded with vitamin K2 and yogurt.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=269s)** — This is interesting because what does the mainstream medicine tell you to do
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=274s)** — to prevent this plucking?
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=276s)** — Avoid saturated fats.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=278s)** — Avoid all these cholesterol foods that have apparently K2,
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=283s)** — which is like the antidote to this calcium buildup.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=286s)** — And there's a great test that you can do. It's called a CAC test.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=289s)** — It stands for coronary artery calcification test.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=294s)** — And it is one of the best predictors of heart failure.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=298s)** — Okay, it's the amount of calcium in your arteries.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=300s)** — It's a relatively inexpensive test.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=302s)** — You can go get it done and it'll actually give you a good idea
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=305s)** — of where you are on the stage of this problem.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=309s)** — If you were going to take vitamin K2 as a supplement,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=312s)** — it works better with vitamin D3.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=314s)** — Okay, you want to take those together.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=316s)** — And the ratio would be this.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=318s)** — Every 100 micrograms of K2, you want 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=324s)** — But this is what you need to know.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=326s)** — Probiotics are atheroprotective.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=329s)** — They protect you against this hearting of the arteries
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=333s)** — and this calcium buildup and this plaque information.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=336s)** — Your friendly microbes are your natural probiotics.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=340s)** — The microbes in your gut actually can eat fiber
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=342s)** — from your vegetables and make certain things as a byproduct.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=347s)** — And one of the things they make is small chain fatty acids,
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=350s)** — which basically is a type of fat that helps lower insulin
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=354s)** — and helps regulate your blood sugars,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=356s)** — which can also help decrease the inflammation in the arteries.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=360s)** — Now, the whole point of this video is to take a look at your diet
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=365s)** — from the viewpoint of, are you living on germ-free sterile foods?
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=372s)** — Okay, I'm talking about pasteurized foods.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=375s)** — You have pasteurized milk, you have pasteurized juice.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=378s)** — Everything is cooked for shelf life.
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=380s)** — We eat foods from boxes, right, on the shelf.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=384s)** — Canned foods, radiated foods.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=386s)** — That's right, they use radiation to kill off microbes
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=389s)** — so they will last longer on the shelf.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=391s)** — I mean, just go to the grocery store and just look on the shelves.
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=394s)** — You will find so many sterilized foods.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=398s)** — It's insane.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=399s)** — And also we cook our foods.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=400s)** — We cook the heck out of our foods
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=402s)** — and we basically kill off all the microbes.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=404s)** — We don't eat a lot of raw foods anymore.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=406s)** — And on top of that, we're eating animals that had antibiotics.
- **[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=411s)** — You have to realize that one of the big side effects
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=413s)** — from antibiotics is that now you have this dysbiosis.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=417s)** — When you kill off microbes, you kill off the good microbes
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=421s)** — with the bad microbes.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=423s)** — And the microbes that survive become now resistant.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=427s)** — And now you have all sorts of additional side effects,
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=429s)** — one being inflammation.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=430s)** — And if you're eating animals that have antibiotics,
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=433s)** — could that have an effect on your body?
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=434s)** — I think to some degree, it can.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=436s)** — When you eat raw foods, and I'm talking about like plants,
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=440s)** — like microgreens that have been grown on soil
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=442s)** — or really healthy plants from your garden,
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=446s)** — there are a lot of microbes in those raw plants
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=449s)** — that you're getting as well.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=451s)** — And they can be considered almost like a probiotic as well.
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=454s)** — And if someone really understands that concept,
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=456s)** — they're gonna start eating more fermented foods, right?
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=459s)** — And there are a lot of different fermented foods.
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=462s)** — Fermented vegetables is a great source
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=464s)** — of these friendly microbes,
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=466s)** — because not only are you getting more microbes
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=469s)** — as an inoculation to your existing microbiome,
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=473s)** — but you're getting kind of this pre-digested food
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=476s)** — that's easier to digest.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=478s)** — And the worse off your digestive system is,
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=480s)** — the more you should have those types of foods.
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=482s)** — So let's circle back and take a look
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=485s)** — at what would be a really good meal
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=486s)** — that would help with your arteries, okay?
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=489s)** — And also this meal that I'm gonna talk about
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=491s)** — is pretty counterintuitive if you match it up
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=495s)** — against mainstream medicine for this problem.
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=498s)** — Because we're gonna pack this meal with the fattiest cheese,
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=500s)** — talking about brie cheese,
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=503s)** — combined with fatty pork sausage,
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=506s)** — and of course, sauerkraut,
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=507s)** — which I'm sure that's acceptable
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=509s)** — by the mainstream medicine.
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=511s)** — These other two ingredients probably are not,
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=513s)** — but just think about what you're getting
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=515s)** — when you have these three things together.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=517s)** — First of all, each one of them
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=519s)** — is loaded with vitamin K2.
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=520s)** — Secondly, you're getting something else.
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=523s)** — All three of these are fermented,
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=525s)** — which means bacteria has acted on these foods
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=529s)** — to enhance the availability of nutrients.
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=533s)** — The digestibility of these products
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=535s)** — are much better because they're fermented,
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=536s)** — and each one of them are not sterile.
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=538s)** — They have microbes that you can use in your own body.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=542s)** — So the next time you're at the grocery store,
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=543s)** — start looking at the foods from the viewpoint of
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=546s)** — how many foods are actually sterile,
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=549s)** — pasteurized, over-processed,
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=550s)** — and make a shift to start buying foods
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=552s)** — that are more alive, more fermented,
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=555s)** — more enhanced with this fermentation process.
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=557s)** — So since we're on the topic of plucking,
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=559s)** — there's more to learn about this.
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=561s)** — And I put this video up right here.
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1OoCX3_0Y&t=564s)** — Check it out.
