- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=0s)** — So what does olive oil do for your body? That's what we're going to talk about today. Now for
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=5s)** — many years I consumed olive oil but I had no idea it wasn't the real olive oil. It was the fake stuff.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=12s)** — It's very bland. It created no itchiness in the back part of my throat like real olive oil does.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=19s)** — So it wasn't until I went to Italy where I visited a farm where they actually make olive oil, the
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=25s)** — real stuff, the extra virgin olive oil. And that was this farm right here. I don't know if you
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=29s)** — can see it. San Michelle a Tori. So this was an amazing experience because I was blown away at
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=38s)** — how they really take care of the soil and the process of making this. And everything is
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=44s)** — cold pressed and extracted without any type of solvents and chemicals. And so after that
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=49s)** — experience I was hooked on olive oil. I consume a lot of olive oil. So the question is what does
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=54s)** — olive oil do to the body and what's in the olive oil that creates these effects? We have antioxidant
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=61s)** — effects. We have anti-inflammatory effects for arthritis, inflammation in the arteries. We have
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=66s)** — all sorts of cardiovascular benefits, decreasing blood pressure. There's a lot of nerve and brain
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=71s)** — effects for your cognitive function, memory, and mood as well as anti-cancer effects. There's
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=84s)** — okay because what's unique about olive oil is the high concentration of
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=90s)** — monounsaturated fat. Now you might say well okay so it's not saturated fat so it must be
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=95s)** — healthy because it's a monounsaturated fat. And 80% of olive oil is monounsaturated fat.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=102s)** — But that is not where you're getting the benefit. I mean it also has a little bit of
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=106s)** — vitamin E. It has vitamin K1. But that's not where you're seeing the big benefits.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=111s)** — All of the therapeutic benefits of this stuff occur because of a group of plant chemicals.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=120s)** — They're called polyphenols. Poly means many. In phenols is a word to describe a certain
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=126s)** — chemistry or a chemical that is from the plant. It's from the fruit of the olive tree,
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=132s)** — the actual olive. So what specific polyphenol does all the magic? All we know is that these
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=138s)** — polyphenols from plants which are developed as a defense mechanism produce a lot of cool effects
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=144s)** — in our bodies especially in preventing the complications from chronic disease,
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=150s)** — oxidative stress that destroys our certain cells. And there's a couple things about
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=155s)** — polyphenols that I'd like to share with you. Number one, they are made from a group of
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=162s)** — amino acids. What's unique about these aromatic amino acids is they follow a very specific
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=170s)** — chemical pathway which is called the chiquimate pathway. So this amino acid pathway involving
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=179s)** — enzymes basically converts these amino acids to polyphenols. And our body doesn't use this
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=187s)** — but plants and microbes do. And this is how Monsanto came up with glyphosate, the herbicide
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=195s)** — that is also classified as an antibiotic that blocks this pathway. So it blocks the
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=202s)** — microbe as well as the plant's ability to utilize or produce these amino acids. So
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=209s)** — there's no conversion to these polyphenols. So the more glyphosate something has,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=215s)** — the less of these phytochemicals that the plant's going to create and the less the
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=221s)** — microbe can make these amino acids. This is why especially if you're going to get olive oil,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=229s)** — you need to do organic because all of the benefits from olive oil occur if you have the
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=236s)** — polyphenols. And if you don't, chances are you're not going to have the benefits. Now this
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=241s)** — pathway also is involved in making dopamine, noradrenaline, the thyroid hormones, serotonin,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=251s)** — melatonin. It probably explains why a lot of people have problems with sleep, the thyroid,
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=257s)** — their mood when they're exposed to glyphosate. So there's more and more research that is showing
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=263s)** — up relating to this affecting your gut microbiome, creating GI problems, creating metabolic problems.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=272s)** — But what I find interesting is that the polyphenols are dependent upon those aromatic
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=279s)** — amino acid turning into these phytochemicals that give you the benefit. The other thing
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=285s)** — that I want you to know about polyphenols is that they're a little bit difficult to
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=289s)** — digest and absorb by your own body. So your own microbes are actually involved in breaking them
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=295s)** — down so they can be absorbed. And the third thing I want you to know, there are polyphenols
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=301s)** — and a lot of other phytonutrients in your salad that you put this on. And the absorption
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=307s)** — is also dependent on if there's fat present. And so that monounsaturated oil fat that's in
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=314s)** — here will greatly help you extract these other phytonutrients from the salad. So in my salads,
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=321s)** — which I consume every day, I use extra virgin olive oil, I use balsamic vinaigrette,
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=328s)** — and sometimes I'll use different spices as well. So regarding olive oil, don't go for
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=333s)** — just the cheap stuff that could be fake. To really know it's real, just the smell of it,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=339s)** — as well as what it does to the back of the throat, it'll irritate the back of the throat.
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=343s)** — That means it has those phytonutrients. If it's too mild or bland, it's not the real stuff.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=349s)** — And the last thing you need to know is always make sure you do the organic
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=352s)** — extra virgin olive oil to avoid any type of extra glyphosate that could end up in a product.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=358s)** — Since we're on the topic of olive oil, if you haven't seen my other popular video,
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37tz8sJlbZk&t=362s)** — I put it up right here. Check it out.
