- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=0s)** — I want to share some very important information about preserving your muscle for longevity.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=5s)** — Did you realize that when certain people lose weight, it actually shortens their lifespan?
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=11s)** — Now, how can that be? I mean, we all know that losing weight helps you live longer,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=15s)** — right? As you get older, it's very important that you maintain a good amount of lean muscle
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=20s)** — mass. As a side note, I do want to mention something that's very popular right now.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=24s)** — People going on Ozempic that manipulate certain hormones to help you establish better blood
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=30s)** — sugar and decrease hunger and slow down digestion. What you should also know is it comes with
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=35s)** — a package. In certain trials, they showed that these drugs can actually significantly
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=40s)** — cause muscle loss. The weight that the person is losing is not all fat. In one
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=45s)** — study, they compared it to a decade or more of aging. It would be terrible for
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=50s)** — someone to go on that drug, lose all this weight, and find out that it actually also
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=55s)** — lost a lot of muscle and then put them at risk for not living as long. As I read
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=60s)** — the study, it became very apparent what you're losing really, really is important.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=64s)** — And when we're talking about preserving lean muscle mass out of all the things
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=68s)** — that you can do for longevity, that is at the top of the list. Muscle loss actually
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=74s)** — starts for most people in their thirties. That's right. We have this peak muscle
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=78s)** — mass, let's say, you know, 18, 19, 20 years old. And then in your thirties, it starts to kind of
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=84s)** — slightly go downward. I want to mention sarcopenia for a second because this is
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=88s)** — age-related muscle loss. And one of the ways they define it is that when you
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=92s)** — lose 20% or more of your muscle, that would be considered sarcopenia.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=96s)** — Muscle helps regulate blood sugar. Muscle supports your metabolism and how
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=102s)** — you metabolize energy. When people start developing this sarcopenia, their
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=105s)** — risk for diabetes goes up, their risk for immune problems goes up, their overall
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=110s)** — mortality, the risk of dying goes up as well. On average, an 80-year-old will
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=114s)** — lose about 50% of their muscle. However, I am going to explain how you
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=119s)** — can avoid that. Of course, one of the most important things you can do
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=123s)** — for your muscle is called exercise, right? Did you realize that inactivity
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=127s)** — can decrease your muscle mass? How many people are sitting in their
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=130s)** — couch just like watching a lot of TV after they retire and they pretty
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=134s)** — much don't exercise anymore? The worst thing you can do for your muscles is
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=138s)** — not move. And the other point about that is, of course, you want to have
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=142s)** — the raw material to build proteins. So that would be grass-fed. Red meat is
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=147s)** — at the top of the list. But what do they tell you to avoid as you get
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=152s)** — older, right? Avoid red meat because it's going to cause cancer. That's a
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=156s)** — total lie. I think it's very, very important to spread out your protein
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=161s)** — throughout the day. You should probably do maybe two meals a day or even three
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=165s)** — meals a day, depending on how much muscle loss that you have. And then you
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=169s)** — should actually take that protein and even it out through the entire day
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=174s)** — to keep a valuable protein there for your muscles to take in through the
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=179s)** — day. And this is one of the problems I have with a person being a vegan,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=182s)** — especially as they get older, getting the quality amount of protein into
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=186s)** — their muscles. Another thing that's really fascinating about this topic is
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=190s)** — that insomnia is very deadly to your muscles. Poor sleep will drain muscle
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=196s)** — mass more than a poor diet. When you're sleeping, this is where all the
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=202s)** — recovery occurs with your muscles. All of the benefit of exercise occurs at
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=207s)** — night, not during the day or not during a stress event. And the type
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=211s)** — of exercise that you do is very, very important, too. You want to do
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=215s)** — something that creates resistance on your muscles. We need to be able to
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=219s)** — generate enough stimulus to cause the muscles to react and adapt to that
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=224s)** — stress. And resistance training is the most important secret to reversing
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=230s)** — age-related muscle loss. This should be a priority for you as you
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=234s)** — get older. It's very, very important. Regular resistance training,
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=238s)** — regular strength training. Your fat is a reserve for energy. Your muscle
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=244s)** — also has a reserve. And this is why your body can fast for a period of
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=249s)** — time. It could not eat for days or weeks. Where is it getting the
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=253s)** — protein? From your muscle. This reserve in your muscle is also
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=257s)** — there to be able to heal from an injury, to allow your immune system
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=262s)** — to tap into these amino acids because your immune system is all
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=266s)** — protein. The white blood cells, the repair enzymes, the enzymes to
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=269s)** — help grow your body are all protein. You also use amino acids to
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=274s)** — make glucose for certain tissues that are dependent on glucose.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=280s)** — Called gluconeogenesis. The formation of new sugar from non-carbohydrate
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=286s)** — sources. This muscle reserve matters. It's super important. Our
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=291s)** — body requires more protein during infection, during an immune
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=295s)** — process, after exercise. Having enough muscle also can influence
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=300s)** — your cognitive state. All these neurotransmitters are made out
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=303s)** — of protein. The muscles are important in your lymphatic
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=306s)** — system because it's dependent on your muscles and how well
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=309s)** — that you use your muscles. When you exercise and you do some
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=311s)** — type of intense exercise, you also release anti-aging molecules.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=317s)** — They're called myokines. They help with pain. They help with
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=325s)** — muscle loss called kaketsia. This is muscle loss at any age.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=329s)** — It's dependent on a chronic illness, whether it's cancer or
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=332s)** — some type of disease. Like in cancer, the body is stealing
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=336s)** — all that protein for its fuel. In summary, these are the
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=339s)** — things that you should focus on as you age. Increase your
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=342s)** — lean body mass. And at the top of the list, consistent
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=345s)** — exercise, high intensity interval training, doing strength
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=348s)** — training, walking, stretching. Number two, your diet. And I'm
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=355s)** — talking about high quality amino acids from red meat. Now it
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=359s)** — is not true that red meat causes cancer. Okay, grass fed
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=362s)** — red meat. I'm talking about beef, lamb, super important.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=366s)** — If you have any problems digesting red meat, which a
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=369s)** — lot of people do as they age, you should acidify the
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=372s)** — stomach instead of avoiding red meat. How do you do that?
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=375s)** — You start taking betaine hydrochloride, like maybe
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=377s)** — four or five of them before you eat the red meat. Build up
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=380s)** — the stomach acid. It's going to help you absorb not just
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=382s)** — the protein, but also minerals as well. Remember, we need
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=386s)** — this high quality protein for our immune system, for enzymes,
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=389s)** — for antioxidants, for the ability to detox, the ability
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=393s)** — to repair, the ability to maintain your muscle. Also
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=398s)** — make a point of this collagen. 30% of your muscles
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=401s)** — are collagen. Take a collagen supplement. Trace minerals and
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=405s)** — other nutrients are very important in the formation of
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=408s)** — muscle. I'm going to list the most important ones first.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=412s)** — Number one, magnesium glycinate. Super, super important.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=415s)** — Magnesium and the exercise will help you sleep, which will
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=419s)** — also help your muscles. Number two, vitamin D. Number
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=421s)** — three, zinc. Very important. And then we get other trace
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=424s)** — minerals like selenium and copper. The B vitamins are
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=426s)** — very important. Coenzyme Q10. Very important. Iron is
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=430s)** — important, but I don't recommend taking them as a
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=432s)** — supplement. Get that from your red meat. But there's one
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=434s)** — more little cool thing I'm going to bring up that I'm
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=437s)** — glad that you stayed this far because this is like really
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=440s)** — important. I recently went from 185 to 191 pounds and it
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=448s)** — was all muscle and I didn't change anything but one thing.
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=452s)** — There's a certain type of cultured microbe that you can
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=455s)** — make and the microbe you would use is called L-ruderide.
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=459s)** — I did a whole video on this, but this microbe has
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=461s)** — some fascinating research with increasing oxytocin, which is
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=466s)** — going to decrease stress. It's going to help your
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=468s)** — muscle. And I think it's doing it for myself and I'm going to
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=475s)** — keep doing this. And if you haven't seen the video of me
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=478s)** — talking about it, I'm going to put it up right here. Check
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrzH4IBs-Q&t=480s)** — it out.
