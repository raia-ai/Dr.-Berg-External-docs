- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=0s)** — There is one really important nutrient deficiency involved in Lyme disease that you absolutely
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=5s)** — need to know about. And you can do all these regular conventional treatments and even
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=10s)** — alternative treatments. But without this one nutrient, you are going to have a hard time
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=15s)** — recovering 100%. And I am going to show you a simple solution that you can do to overcome this.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=21s)** — The nutrient deficiency in Lyme is Vitamin D. Now the big question is why? Well, that
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=30s)** — Spirochetes in Lyme disease, this very specific microbe, has a very sneaky trick of blocking
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=38s)** — your ability to receive Vitamin D. In other words, you can have normal Vitamin D levels
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=45s)** — in your blood and be severely deficient of Vitamin D deep in your tissues. The way Vitamin D
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=51s)** — actually works, typically from sun, the sun hits your skin that then goes through several
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=58s)** — changes within your liver and your kidneys to eventually turn into the active form of Vitamin D.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=65s)** — But it then has to be received by the Vitamin D receptor, which is deep inside your cells
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=72s)** — in the nucleus of the cell. But the unique thing with this microorganism in Lyme,
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=78s)** — and what it does to your Vitamin D receptor, is it downgrades that receptor by 50 to 80x.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=85s)** — The ability of your immune system to fight back is pretty much nullified. So all these
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=90s)** — remedies and antibiotics are going to try to kill it, but your immune system is still weakened.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=96s)** — Now I'm going to show you how to fix this problem, but I really want you to understand
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=100s)** — why so many people with Lyme are suffering for years and years and years unnecessarily.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=107s)** — Other microbes also do the same thing, especially viruses like Epstein-Barr virus,
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=113s)** — and even certain types of cancer also downgrade the receptor for Vitamin D. This is their dirty
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=120s)** — little trick to overcome the defenses of your own immune system. It's basically like being in
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=125s)** — this battle between you and another army and having the ability to remove the weapons on the
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=133s)** — other side. You know, the problem is there's no routine blood test that you're going to
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=137s)** — be able to test this Vitamin D receptor problem. You really can't go by what's in the
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=141s)** — blood. You have to do a specialized Vitamin D receptor test, and I will put that link down
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=146s)** — below if you want a couple options. So here you are, you're at the doctor, you get a Lyme test,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=152s)** — becomes positive, you check your Vitamin D, it's normal, but it's not really normal deep
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=158s)** — inside. I mean just think about how many other conditions are related to a Vitamin D
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=163s)** — deficiency. Autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, certain cognitive problems. So there's
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=170s)** — estimations up to 30% of the entire population has a problem with this Vitamin D receptor,
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=175s)** — but a huge portion of people that are overweight have resistance to Vitamin D
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=181s)** — at the receptor level. Other microorganisms also have this nasty trick like chlamydia,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=188s)** — mycoplasmas. So basically there's this hijacking occurring at your Vitamin D
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=192s)** — receptor, and it basically usually gets unnoticed because it's not on a routine blood
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=197s)** — toxic mold aspergillus also can downgrade this Vitamin D receptor. When you get a blood test
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=204s)** — for Vitamin D, usually they test the inactive version for various reasons I'm not going to
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=209s)** — get into, but if you ever check your active version of Vitamin D, sometimes that's actually
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=214s)** — even higher just because of the compensation of what your body is trying to do to push
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=220s)** — through and override this Vitamin D receptor resistance. And so if you ever get that blood
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=226s)** — test done and the doctor sees that your Vitamin D levels are high, what are they going to tell
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=232s)** — you? Make sure you don't take Vitamin D. So wherever you are in the stage of this Lyme disease,
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=239s)** — Vitamin D is going to be really important to turn this thing around, but how are we going to
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=243s)** — override this resistance to Vitamin D? Well, I'm going to give you a bunch of things to do
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=249s)** — because the darker your skin is, the more Vitamin D you're going to need and the less
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=253s)** — you're going to get from the sun. The older they are, the less absorption of Vitamin D you can
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=258s)** — have. The lower your cholesterol is, or let's say for example you have liver problems or kidney
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=262s)** — problems or let's say you had your gallbladder removed or you're on a statin. All of these
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=266s)** — are additional barriers to Vitamin D. So you need certain things like zinc, magnesium
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=272s)** — to allow Vitamin D to work. If you're also consuming seed oils, that can block your
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=279s)** — for Vitamin D. And of course if you're a smoker, that could also be an issue.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=284s)** — How do we increase Vitamin D? Well, number one, you start taking large amounts of Vitamin D,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=289s)** — but I wouldn't take it every day. If we want to get more penetration to override this
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=295s)** — resistance, you want to take a lot of Vitamin D, like 50,000 IUs sporadically,
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=302s)** — maybe once a week. Now of course being out in the sun is going to help. Omega-3 fatty
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=306s)** — acids are also important. Risveratrol is another thing you can take to help increase
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=312s)** — the receptiveness of the Vitamin D receptor. Intense exercise will also help. The
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=319s)** — phytonutrient quercetin can help as well. And zinc and boron and even progesterone
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=326s)** — and sulforaphane are all compounds that help override this problem. But there's one more
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=332s)** — thing you can do that actually can help you. Titka is a type of bile salt that also activates
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=338s)** — the Vitamin D receptor. I did some research on this and I was looking at all the alternative
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=344s)** — ways to kind of allow that Vitamin D receptor to work better. And bile salts came up,
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=352s)** — which is fascinating. Now you know one of the most important nutrients involved in lime
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=357s)** — that could potentially take your problems that you have right now and put them right straight
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=361s)** — into remission. Now there's more to learn about your immune system. If you have not seen this
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIHzJ6bGnU&t=366s)** — video, check it out. I put it up right here.
