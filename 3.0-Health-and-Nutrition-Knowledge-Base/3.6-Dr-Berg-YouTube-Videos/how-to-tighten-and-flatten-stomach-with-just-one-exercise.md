- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=0s)** — How to tighten and flatten your stomach with just one move.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=3s)** — And we're not talking about sit-ups.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=4s)** — Everyone knows this as a fact.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=6s)** — You must absolutely make sure that the calories you're putting in your body
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=9s)** — do not exceed what you're expending or using.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=12s)** — And that way, if we create a deficit,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=15s)** — then this is naturally going to ride right into a loss of weight.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=19s)** — Let's just take a look at this.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=20s)** — And that's fundamentally how you lose body fat,
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=22s)** — by creating a calorie deficit.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=24s)** — The only true requirement is that you maintain a calorie deficit.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=27s)** — This puts you in an overall calorie deficit.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=28s)** — If you're having a hard time reaching a caloric deficit,
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=32s)** — about how to stay in a calorie deficit...
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=34s)** — Every time I would ask an older individual who is overweight,
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=37s)** — that wanted to lose weight,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=39s)** — when did your stubborn metabolism start?
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=43s)** — It was usually in their late 20s or early 30s,
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=47s)** — after a series of calorie restrictive diets.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=52s)** — And it is a theory, it's not a fact.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=53s)** — I mean, we've tried this for decades and it just has not worked.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=56s)** — Here's the missing piece of the puzzle that you really need to understand.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=60s)** — Our bodies are not as simple as a car,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=63s)** — where you have inputs and outputs.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=65s)** — We have what's called the endocrine system.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=68s)** — And this system causes our body to adapt within its environment.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=73s)** — And so what the body is going to do when you lower your calories,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=77s)** — is it's going to adjust.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=79s)** — It's going to become more efficient,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=81s)** — which you may feel that it's a bit slow.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=83s)** — It can run further on the same amount of fuel as before.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=88s)** — The other problem with lowering your calories,
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=91s)** — is that now we increase the battle of hunger, cravings,
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=97s)** — and now it's going to be even harder,
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=99s)** — because you're going to have to increase your willpower to stick to it.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=102s)** — So is this whole calorie deficit model sustainable?
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=104s)** — No, it's not.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=105s)** — I want to bring up one book right here.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=108s)** — It's called Guyton's Physiology.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=110s)** — And I want to show you two quotes out of the book.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=114s)** — Page 927.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=116s)** — Right here. Let's take a look at this.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=118s)** — All aspects of fat metabolism are greatly enhanced in the absence of insulin.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=125s)** — Then we have page 822.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=127s)** — It says right here,
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=128s)** — When carbohydrates are not utilized for energy,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=131s)** — almost all of the energy of the body must come from the metabolism of fats.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=137s)** — I really think that people who are stuck in this outdated model of calorie deficit,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=143s)** — just don't understand insulin.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=146s)** — And unfortunately, you know, when you're taking classes,
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=150s)** — whether you're studying Guyton's Physiology, maybe in school,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=152s)** — they're not going to really emphasize that point.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=154s)** — To really understand this,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=155s)** — you're going to have to really dive into it and study it after you graduate,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=159s)** — because it's not really taught.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=161s)** — Insulin is the hormone that controls whether you burn fat or not.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=166s)** — If you reduce insulin, your body can then tap into your own fat for energy.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=171s)** — And the thing that triggers insulin is carbohydrates.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=174s)** — If we look at the three parts of food,
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=175s)** — we have carbohydrates, protein, and fat.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=179s)** — It's the carbohydrates that stimulate insulin the most.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=182s)** — Fat actually is neutral.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=184s)** — Protein has a moderate effect on insulin,
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=187s)** — but it doesn't even compare to carbohydrates.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=190s)** — This right there tells us you cannot treat all three of these equally.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=194s)** — All calories are not the same.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=196s)** — It is important to talk about the quality or the type of calorie we're talking about.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=201s)** — And if we really want to lose weight, we must lower insulin.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=204s)** — To do that, we must lower our carbohydrate calorie.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=207s)** — What's interesting about lowering our carbohydrate calorie and lowering insulin,
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=212s)** — our body needs to get fuel.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=215s)** — Where is it going to get the fuel?
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=216s)** — When you are eating, you're getting your energy from your food.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=220s)** — When you're not eating, where are you getting your energy from?
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=223s)** — Are you getting it from fat?
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=224s)** — If you're living on a higher carbohydrate diet,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=228s)** — it's very unlikely you're going to be able to tap in too much fat.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=230s)** — If you can lower your carbs, your body can then finally tap into your own fat.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=236s)** — Let's say, for example, you're living on 1500 calories with the low carb diet.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=240s)** — You're also, in addition to those 1500 calories,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=244s)** — using a good amount of fat calories.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=247s)** — It could be, I don't know, 500 or more, maybe 700, 800 additional calories
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=253s)** — that we can put in the pool for energy.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=256s)** — Part of its diet, part of its your own fat.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=259s)** — And so guess what's so cool about that?
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=260s)** — Your hunger goes away.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=261s)** — You're no longer craving carbs between meals. Why?
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=264s)** — Your body is eating your own fat between the meal.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=267s)** — If you don't lower insulin, your body is not going to eat your own fat.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=271s)** — But if you do lower insulin with a low carb,
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=274s)** — then the body will eat your own fat as fuel.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=277s)** — We can make it easy on yourself,
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=279s)** — not have any cravings or hunger while you're doing your weight loss program.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=283s)** — Or you can cut your calories.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=284s)** — And the cool thing about the ketogenic diet,
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=287s)** — which is the low carb diet,
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=289s)** — is that a lot of the energy that your body is running off of
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=292s)** — is not from the diet.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=294s)** — It's from your own body fat.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=297s)** — And I think one argument that some people bring up is,
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=300s)** — yes, doing low carb, it's going to help you.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=303s)** — But then also when you do fasting,
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=305s)** — you're naturally lowering your calories.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=308s)** — And some people will say the reason why the ketogenic diet helps you lose weight
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=311s)** — is you're eating less calories because it's all about calories.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=315s)** — If that's true, then how do you explain
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=317s)** — that when you go on a ketogenic diet
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=319s)** — and you do intermittent fasting,
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=321s)** — and yes, you might be eating less calories,
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=323s)** — you don't crave anything.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=324s)** — We compare that to you just cutting your calories and not your carbohydrates.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=329s)** — You're going to be craving all day long.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=332s)** — If your body is getting enough fuel,
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=335s)** — there's no reason to slow down the metabolism
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=337s)** — because your body is getting all the energy it needs.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=340s)** — This is the purpose of fat, to be able to survive between meals.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=345s)** — You want to think about your fat as a biological pantry
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=349s)** — that you're tapping into.
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=351s)** — So you don't have to tap into your actual pantry.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=354s)** — This does work.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=356s)** — And I have 8,000 people to prove it.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=359s)** — Check this out on my website.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=360s)** — The other little point on this is that
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=362s)** — Fat provides more than double the energy
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=364s)** — than glucose provides.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=367s)** — It's very important to tap into fat
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=369s)** — to use that as a nice sustainable amount of energy for your body.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=374s)** — The key to this whole thing is turning insulin way down.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=378s)** — I am almost to the exercise I'm going to show you
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=380s)** — to tighten and tone the midsection.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=383s)** — But I wanted just to kind of mention just one thing.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=386s)** — It takes about two to three days to get into the state of ketosis.
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=390s)** — So it's not that long.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=392s)** — But it does take two to three weeks
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=394s)** — to fully get into hardcore fat adaptation.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=399s)** — And I want to explain the difference.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=401s)** — Fat adaptation is when your body is burning the most fat possible.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=406s)** — And your body can burn ketones, but it can also burn fat.
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=410s)** — That's actually two different sources of fuel.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=412s)** — If we look at carbohydrates, proteins, and fats,
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=415s)** — carbohydrates should be about 5% of the diet.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=418s)** — The protein should be about 20%.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=420s)** — And the rest should be the fat.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=422s)** — Inside your abdomen, you may have what's called visceral fat.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=426s)** — And that is going to come off with the diet that I just mentioned.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=430s)** — You also have the superficial layer of fat,
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=433s)** — which is also like a spillover from the other fat
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=436s)** — that is being backed up into the organs.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=438s)** — Deeper in there, you have a layer of fascia.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=441s)** — This fascia is like a gel-like connective tissue.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=444s)** — And it can atrophy if you don't use it.
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=447s)** — And that atrophy can look like a flabby stomach.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=451s)** — What I'm going to show you is one of the best exercises
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=455s)** — that is not a set-up, that is going to tone and tighten
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=460s)** — this area around your abdomen to get rid of that flabby stomach
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=466s)** — and almost act like a girdle that's keeping everything nice and tight and toned.
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=471s)** — All we're going to do is this one exercise called...
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=475s)** — it's a funny name... the dead bug.
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=478s)** — And it's called a dead bug because it looks like a dead bug, upside down,
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=483s)** — trying to flip over.
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=485s)** — And I'm going to recommend you do this alternating your leg and your arm
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=489s)** — when you reach back.
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=490s)** — You see, this will give the optimum tension in the middle section
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=494s)** — to stimulate the fascia and the muscles to get really nice and toned.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=499s)** — Versus if you did sit-ups or crunches, the problem with that is
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=503s)** — you're going to activate the deeper muscles called the psoas,
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=506s)** — which are the hip flexors, and that is going to eventually cause
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=510s)** — your back to be out of balance.
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=512s)** — But here's how you do it right here.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=514s)** — Today's exercise tutorial is the dead bug.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=516s)** — Dead bugs are great for helping to control front-to-back pelvic tilting.
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=520s)** — That's also a good abdominal exercise that improves coordination.
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=524s)** — And it generally makes you long and straight.
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=526s)** — One of the secondary functions is to help you control rotation in the hips.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=531s)** — So to get started, you're going to lay down on your back.
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=537s)** — We lay down on our back with our knees over our hips.
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=541s)** — Our hips, knees, and ankles are bent at 90-degree angles.
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=545s)** — Our back, our lower back is flat on the ground so that I cannot slide my hand
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=549s)** — underneath my back.
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=550s)** — So it's by controlling this pelvic tilting, we control the arch in our lower back.
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=555s)** — Use your abdominals. Your arms are straight up, pointing at the ceiling.
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=559s)** — From this position, fully extend your left leg.
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=563s)** — Your toes remain pointing at the ceiling.
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=565s)** — Your lower back remains in contact with the ground.
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=568s)** — Reset to the starting position and then you can switch sides or finish your set on the same side.
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=575s)** — To vary this exercise, we can move our arms and legs at the same time.
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=580s)** — We can go same side.
- **[09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=582s)** — Or we can go opposite side.
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=586s)** — Again, the key is to keep your lower back in contact with the ground.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=591s)** — And to only move those limbs and those parts of our body that we want to move.
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=597s)** — The lower back stays in contact with the ground.
- **[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=599s)** — Do this exercise every single day and within one or two weeks you're going to start to see some amazing results.
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gl002hqik&t=605s)** — If you want details on how to do the diet, I put that video up right here. Check it out.
