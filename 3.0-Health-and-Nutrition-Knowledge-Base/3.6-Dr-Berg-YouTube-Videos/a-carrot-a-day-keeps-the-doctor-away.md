- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=0s)** — You know, when we're dealing with creating health and fighting off health problems,
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=5s)** — it's not just one food. It's a combination of foods. So today we're going to talk about
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=9s)** — one additional food that I think you should add to your daily salads and that is the lonely
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=15s)** — carrot. Now, I've done past videos on carrots relating to the ketogenic diet, but not necessarily
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=21s)** — the health properties of carrots. And I recently stumbled on some data that is quite fascinating.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=27s)** — Carrots can actually do more for your health than you might think. Now, the first thing that usually
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=32s)** — comes up with a carrot is that it's generally sweet, so people are avoiding those because
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=38s)** — they're trying to avoid carbs on the ketogenic diet. And it is true that the glycemic index
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=44s)** — of a carrot is about 72. So high is starting at 70. So it's 72. So yeah, it's a little bit high.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=52s)** — But because it's so filled with fiber, and the net carbs for one medium carrot
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=61s)** — is only 4.3 carbs, and you're allowed like 50 carbs, it falls in the category of something
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=68s)** — is pretty safe because the glycemic load, which is a little different than the glycemic
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=73s)** — index, is a different formula. It's basically the amount of carbs because we're deducting
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=79s)** — all this fiber. Brings the carrot down to like 2.8 on the glycemic load scale. I mean,
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=85s)** — think about this. Anything less than 10 is low. It's pretty low on the glycemic load. So you're
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=92s)** — not going to bump yourself out of ketosis by eating a carrot a day. Carrots typically are
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=97s)** — thought of improving your eyesight because they're loaded with the precursor to vitamin A.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=104s)** — And beta carotene, which is the precursor, is not a retinol, the active form of vitamin A,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=109s)** — even though they call it vitamin A. It's a precursor. It has to be converted. And there's
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=113s)** — a small percentage that can convert to retinol. It's not that high, but it's something. Now,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=119s)** — there are a lot of other things in carrots. You have all sorts of phytonutrients that help
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=123s)** — as a general antioxidant. So let's get into it. Number one, the fiber in carrots that we
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=130s)** — can't digest, but our microbes can, can greatly help you detoxify estrogen. And so if you're
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=138s)** — estrogen dominant, it can help balance that. Now, what are the risk factors of estrogen dominance?
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=144s)** — Well, problems with your menstrual cycle, heavy periods, waking in a lower section of your
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=149s)** — body, increased risk of cancer. And so anything that can actually buffer this estrogen is a good
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=154s)** — thing. Number two, it lessens the activation of procarcinogens. Those are things that are like
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=162s)** — carcinogenic, things that can cause cancer. Well, they lessen the activation of that. Number
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=167s)** — three, it's an antioxidant. Number four, it's anti-angiogenic. What does that mean?
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=172s)** — Well, when a cancer cell grows, it needs blood supply. And so there are various
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=177s)** — vegetables, definitely the cruciferous vegetables, but also carrots, that can inhibit
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=183s)** — these new blood vessels to tumors. Thus are called anti-angiogenic. Carrots also have
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=191s)** — anti-clotting properties. They also have properties that can help fight mycoplasmas,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=196s)** — which are bacteria without the cell wall. But I think one of the biggest benefits of carrots
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=203s)** — is related to this other phytonutrient. And it's called fall carinol. Now, there is some
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=213s)** — related synergistic compounds, but nonetheless, if you eat a raw carrot a day, you're going to
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=219s)** — get a good amount of this fall carinol. And fall carinol is a natural pesticide
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=226s)** — and fungicide. Fall carinol is also in fennel, it's in celery, it's in ginseng,
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=233s)** — it's in parsley. But there's a lot of it in carrots. Now, even though it's a natural
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=238s)** — pesticide, it's not harmful to our bodies. So you don't have to worry about it. In fact,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=243s)** — it may help you if you have any pathogenic funguses growing in your body. But the big
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=247s)** — thing that fall carinol does is what it can do for cancer. Apparently, the research shows
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=254s)** — that it can significantly decrease the risk of cancer, especially breast cancer and prostate
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=260s)** — cancer and gastric cancer and maybe even other cancers. And this other function may relate to
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=267s)** — or just in general, it just may help you with inflammation because fall carinol is a potent
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=274s)** — inhibitor of intestinal inflammation, even more than sulforaphane. And I've done videos on this
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=280s)** — where I talked about sulforaphane helping with gastritis and all sorts of inflammation in your
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=287s)** — gut. And sulforaphane is in broccoli and broccoli sprouts. But we don't want to forget
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=291s)** — Okay, so I would recommend eating one, at least one medium-sized raw carrot,
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=297s)** — organic raw carrot in your salad or just in general each day. And one of the ways that it
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=302s)** — can do this is through stimulating the tumor suppressor genes. And these are things that
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=308s)** — can actually suppress the genetics that relate to growing tumors. In some of these studies,
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=314s)** — which I'll list down below, you get a slower development of the cancer. You get inhibition
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=320s)** — of the aggressive cancer cells. You also get induction of apoptosis. What does that mean?
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=326s)** — It means that it triggers the cancer cells to die. Now, since we're on the topic of cancer,
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=332s)** — okay, in foods, you should definitely see this video that related to other foods you should be
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgbv2ZrC1xM&t=337s)** — eating to lower your risk of cancer. And I put that up right here.
