- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=0s)** — Do not take baking soda unless you watch this video. Baking soda has the potential to help or even
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=6s)** — poison you. Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. It's an alkaline compound. And guess what? Your
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=12s)** — body makes it. Your pancreas makes it. As the strong acid comes from your stomach into the
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=17s)** — small intestine, if that pancreas does not release enough sodium bicarbonate, you don't get
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=21s)** — any of the benefits from the enzymes coming from the pancreas to help you digest fats
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=26s)** — and other things. This is why when someone's pancreas is not working, boy, they can get
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=31s)** — severe bloating. They get diarrhea. They get constipation. We need a really strong acid
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=37s)** — stomach and then we need an alkaline small intestine. Let's talk first about the benefits
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=41s)** — of baking soda. Baking soda, being an alkaline substance, can be beneficial for temporarily
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=48s)** — relieving an acid stomach. I have to clarify something because when we talk about an acid
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=52s)** — stomach, a lot of things come up. You might have like GERD, acid reflux. All those things
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=57s)** — are a little bit different because you never want to take baking soda when you have indigestion.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=63s)** — Indigestion is like this backup of food that just you feel like your stomach is like cramping.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=68s)** — That is a classic low acid or a lack of acid situation. So of course, adding more
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=75s)** — baking soda is just going to go from bad to worse. Anytime you have indigestion, you need
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=79s)** — to take either apple cider vinegar or something called betaine hydrochloride. It will fix it really
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=85s)** — fast. But when we get into more of an acidic stomach, whether it is acid reflux or GERD,
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=91s)** — if you wanted some temporary relief as you fix the problem, a little bit of baking soda
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=95s)** — would help you. But just a little bit because usually those problems are also a lack of
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=100s)** — acid. But the baking soda will at least put the fire out and make you feel more comfortable.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=104s)** — But then you would also want to do apple cider vinegar and or betaine hydrochloride. Now,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=109s)** — what about gastritis? You would want to take baking soda for sure. But also take something
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=114s)** — called zinc carnosine so you can actually heal that problem. But you just need to understand
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=120s)** — that the normal pH of the stomach is between one and three. That is like battery acid. And
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=127s)** — just don't get in habit of taking baking soda for a long period of time because you're
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=131s)** — going to neutralize your stomach acids. And now you're going to end up with an inability
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=136s)** — to digest protein, the inability to absorb B12, the inability to absorb minerals. And also,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=144s)** — you're not going to be able to kill off any type of microbes or pathogens that might be
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=148s)** — in your food. Now, if you take baking soda for a long time chronically, is there really
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=153s)** — a chance of your blood becoming too alkaline? And the answer is probably not because the
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=159s)** — effect that baking soda has on our bodies is very temporary. If your body is too alkaline,
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=164s)** — you're going to have some issues with your muscles because of how that affects the electrolytes.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=169s)** — Another really good benefit of baking soda is to help to neutralize the acid in your mouth
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=175s)** — from the bacteria that is forming these little biofilm tartar placking situations. So baking
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=181s)** — soda could be one of the ingredients in your toothpaste. And I actually show you how to make
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=185s)** — that. I will put that link down below. But ultimately, you got to get the sugar out of
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=188s)** — the diet because sugar is what's making that acid. Another benefit of baking soda is to
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=193s)** — itching from a kidney problem. When your kidney becomes damaged, you start developing too much
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=201s)** — acid and that can affect your skin, especially itching among other symptoms. One of the great
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=207s)** — antidotes to that is to take something to neutralize the acid and that takes the stress
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=211s)** — off the kidney. In fact, some people with kidney problems even take some baking soda to
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=216s)** — prolong going on dialysis because when the kidneys are damaged, it can't regulate the pH
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=222s)** — anymore like it used to because a diseased kidney will make more acids. Now, another way I would use
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=229s)** — baking soda is let's say, for example, you're doing prolonged fasting or even intermittent
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=234s)** — fasting in your carnivore, you're doing a lot of meat and then you start feeling this
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=239s)** — acidity coming up through your stomach. Some baking soda here and there can help
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=243s)** — chill that out, especially if you're trying to sleep at night and it's kind of coming up
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=247s)** — through your esophagus. Another unique beneficial way to take baking soda is if you're
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=251s)** — an athlete and you're going to compete in some sport and you wanted the unfair advantage. You
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=257s)** — wanted to be able to do more reps. You wanted to go a little longer. You want a little better
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=261s)** — performance and less lactic acid buildup, which can actually stop you from using your muscles,
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=267s)** — especially with high intensity type activities because if you take all of it at once and
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=272s)** — feel nauseous, you want to avoid that. If you really want to know how much you should take,
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=276s)** — it's 0.2 grams per kilogram of weight. Another benefit of baking soda is to help prevent
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=284s)** — kidney stones. So if you're susceptible to kidney stones, you can take some baking soda
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=288s)** — because uric acid dissolves in baking soda. And this is why baking soda is also good in
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=294s)** — a gout situation, at least as a temporary action. Of course, ultimately you'd want to
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=298s)** — avoid any type of fructose, high fructose corn syrup, especially. Another way you can
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=303s)** — baking soda is if you have a UTI. It'll actually change the environment so the microbes or the
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=309s)** — pathogens can't exist anymore. And then the last benefit of baking soda would be some topical
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=315s)** — applications for some type of insect bite. If the insect's venom is alkaline, that could make
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=322s)** — you worse. There are two insects that have an acid venom. So applying baking soda would help
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=329s)** — ants, especially fire ants, and bee stings would benefit from putting some topical baking soda
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=335s)** — on the actual sting bite. So just get some wet and apply it to your skin. If you get stung by
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=341s)** — a wasp, do not put baking soda on that because those venoms are more alkaline. If you add more
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=346s)** — alkaline, you're going to make it worse. What you should put on that is vinegar. A spider bite,
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=351s)** — don't put baking soda on that. The best thing to put on that is either activated charcoal
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=356s)** — or bentonite clay, which has the power of pulling things out of the skin. And then a
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=361s)** — snake bite. The best antidote for that is something called milk thistle. And as a side
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=367s)** — note, baking soda is also really good for insects, especially cockroaches. Because if you
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=372s)** — add sugar with baking soda and you leave it out for the cockroaches, they'll eat it. Then
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=378s)** — from the chemical reaction, you'll get carbon dioxide and their digestive systems will rupture
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=383s)** — and they will die. So that would be a natural way to get rid of these insects so you don't have
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=389s)** — these insecticides around your house. The other thing you need to know about baking soda is you
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=393s)** — never want to take it with vinegar or a lemon juice because it's just going to create so much
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=399s)** — carbon dioxide, your stomach is going to bloat up with carbon dioxide. Not a good idea. And I
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=405s)** — think you already know this too. You can open a container of baking soda and keep it in the
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=410s)** — fridge and it gets rid of the odors. So now that you know a little bit more about this
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZo7c-nR1Ts&t=415s)** — home remedy baking soda, you should check out my apple cider vinegar video right here.
