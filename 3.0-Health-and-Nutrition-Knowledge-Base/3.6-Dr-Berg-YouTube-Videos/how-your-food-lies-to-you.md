- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=0s)** — Now there's some great new data I want to share with you about reversing diabetes by getting rid of the fat in your liver.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=9s)** — Now of course they don't mention the word reversing diabetes. They call it putting diabetes in remission.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=15s)** — But there's some interesting data I want to share with you.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=17s)** — So apparently there's a tremendous amount of data pointing to insulin resistance starting in the muscles and then in your liver.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=28s)** — But there's some conflicting data because other data points to it starting in your muscles and then it transfers to the liver.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=36s)** — But all you need to know is if you fix insulin resistance, you can fix diabetes.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=41s)** — And if you have a fatty liver, you're not going to be able to fix insulin resistance for any period of time.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=46s)** — You might feel a little bit better, but that fat in your liver must be removed.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=51s)** — So what is this connection between a fatty liver and diabetes?
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=55s)** — Well, one of the functions of the liver beyond the detoxification function is the storage of glucose as glycogen.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=66s)** — So typically of a certain amount of storage of glycogen in your liver and also in your muscles.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=70s)** — And that glucose in the liver supplies your brain and other organs with glucose between meals and then when you exercise.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=77s)** — And that glycogen in your liver supplies the fuel to your brain between meals and also when you're exercising.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=84s)** — Whereas the muscle glycogen pretty much only supplies the muscles with energy or glucose.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=91s)** — But when you have insulin resistance, you don't really get that benefit.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=94s)** — And so when you exercise, your performance isn't very good. You don't have good endurance.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=99s)** — You get a lot of fatigue, especially with exercise.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=102s)** — And then when you get insulin resistance in your liver over a period of time,
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=105s)** — that develops into pre-diabetes and diabetes because of the spill off of fat that then it's called ectopic.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=112s)** — It actually goes out of the fat cell and then it starts accumulating around the pancreas.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=117s)** — Okay, and inside the pancreas.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=119s)** — And then because the pancreas controls insulin through beta cells,
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=124s)** — the beta cells start to malfunction and then you get diabetes.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=128s)** — And it's been documented that you can't reverse that.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=131s)** — But that is absolutely positively not true. You can reverse beta cell dysfunction.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=137s)** — Now, I'm not talking about in type 1 diabetes. I'm talking about type 2 diabetes.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=142s)** — And the way you would reverse it is you just need to get rid of the fat in the pancreas.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=146s)** — Okay, and allow the cell to come back.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=150s)** — But to fix the pancreas, you have to first fix the liver.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=153s)** — You have to remove the fat from the liver so you can improve insulin resistance,
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=157s)** — which by the way can happen in six days.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=161s)** — But the pancreas could take a little bit longer. It could take like eight weeks.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=164s)** — So what am I actually saying? I'm saying this.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=166s)** — If you have diabetes or pre-diabetes or insulin resistance,
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=170s)** — you need to focus on removing the fat from your liver.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=174s)** — Okay, as a primary goal. And then as you do that,
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=178s)** — the fat from your pancreas will also decrease.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=181s)** — And then the function of the beta cell of the pancreas will start to improve.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=185s)** — Now the question is, how do you do it? Right? How do you do it?
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=189s)** — Do you just start going on a low-fat diet? Do you start to exercise more?
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=194s)** — What is the best thing to do?
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=196s)** — Well, first I need to explain something to you because a lot of people don't know that
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=202s)** — your brain can run on two types of fuel.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=206s)** — Okay, it can run on glucose and it can run on ketones.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=209s)** — And because there's so much bad PR on ketones, right?
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=212s)** — Like, oh yeah, if you go on a ketogenic diet over a period of time,
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=216s)** — you'll develop ketoacidosis and that's a very severe pathology.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=221s)** — So you need to avoid ketones, right? That's completely and utterly false.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=225s)** — That only occurs when you're type 1 diabetic.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=228s)** — So if people drink that Kool-Aid and they buy into that,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=231s)** — then they're left with this fuel source called glucose.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=234s)** — Because mainstream medicine will tell you that, well, the brain
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=236s)** — prefers glucose and that's really the only fuel that you need to focus on.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=240s)** — And so if that's all the data you have,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=243s)** — boy, you're going to have a hard time fixing this problem.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=246s)** — So let me just mention this word hypoglycemia, right? We have low blood sugars.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=250s)** — Think about all of the brain symptoms with hypoglycemia.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=256s)** — You have problems with your thinking, memory, learning.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=261s)** — Think about how many kids in school that have low blood sugars, right?
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=264s)** — And they're trying to learn on top of that headache, tired, blurred vision,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=270s)** — lightheadedness, all these issues with your head.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=274s)** — Hypoglycemia originates in your liver. Why?
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=277s)** — Because of the glycogen restored being inhibited because of the fatty liver or dysfunctional liver.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=284s)** — So when your liver doesn't work, you can't store glycogen properly.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=290s)** — The stored sugar in your muscles is not readily available to you.
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=293s)** — It's only going to supply your muscles.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=295s)** — The brain glucose is dependent on the liver function.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=298s)** — But if you have a fatty liver, which a lot of people do, especially if they're overweight,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=303s)** — they're not going to be able to store glycogen properly.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=305s)** — And the more fat they accumulate in the liver, the more insulin resistance they have.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=309s)** — And the more insulin that's going to go higher, pushing your blood sugars down,
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=315s)** — giving you this hypoglycemia and all the symptoms that are associated with it.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=319s)** — Now you might think that it takes a lot of fat in your liver to cause insulin resistance,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=324s)** — but it doesn't.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=326s)** — I just found some interesting data that you can develop insulin resistance
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=330s)** — with less than 2% of the liver being fatty.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=334s)** — I think this specific number was 1.85% of your liver being fatty,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=339s)** — and you developing insulin resistance symptoms, which is, to me, very, very low.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=344s)** — So in other words, it only takes a little bit of this fat on your liver to start this process.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=348s)** — You see, this insulin resistance happens all over the place.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=350s)** — It's in the liver, okay?
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=352s)** — It's also in your muscles, like I mentioned.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=354s)** — It's also in your brain.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=356s)** — So if your diet has too much glucose, you literally are slowly killing off your neurons,
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=362s)** — which is kind of a paradox because apparently, like even Alzheimer's and a lot of
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=367s)** — brain issues occur because you're starving the neurons of glucose.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=373s)** — But too much glucose will actually kill the neurons.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=376s)** — So the neurons die if you don't feed the glucose,
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=379s)** — and the neurons die if you feed the neurons glucose.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=382s)** — So what's going on here?
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=383s)** — Well, maybe the brain wasn't designed to run on glucose in the first place.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=388s)** — So just maybe when you increase glucose to the brain cells,
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=392s)** — the body protects the brain cells by developing this resistance,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=397s)** — making it more difficult to penetrate.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=400s)** — And maybe your body's trying to tell you,
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=402s)** — don't consume glucose because then that's going to create a problem.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=405s)** — And of course, in the background, we have the mechanism being insulin resistance.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=409s)** — So the more insulin resistance, the less glucose you can absorb in the neuron,
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=414s)** — because the neuron needs insulin to be able to absorb glucose.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=418s)** — And this is why one of the treatments that they're using for this,
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=423s)** — like Alzheimer's or dementia, is an intranasal insulin spray,
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=428s)** — where they spray this insulin up your sinuses.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=431s)** — It goes directly in the brain and it improves dementia symptoms.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=435s)** — Now that's adding more insulin to your brain.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=438s)** — When you try to increase your insulin in your brain by eating more glucose,
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=442s)** — all you do is you just increase more resistance.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=444s)** — Okay, so it doesn't work.
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=446s)** — So if we just step back for a moment and take a look at this problem,
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=450s)** — how do we reverse diabetes?
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=453s)** — Okay, how do we reverse all these cognitive problems
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=456s)** — that we have associated with this blood sugar issue
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=459s)** — that's associated with a fatty liver?
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=462s)** — First of all, you have to realize that the brain prefers,
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=465s)** — not glucose, but ketones.
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=467s)** — The way to fix the liver is to run your body on ketones, not glucose.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=472s)** — The way to reverse the fat on your pancreas
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=474s)** — and reverse the beta cell function is to run the body on ketones.
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=480s)** — Ketones will improve cholesterol, triglyceride, and other lipids in your liver.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=487s)** — Ketones will help decrease fat on your liver.
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=491s)** — This is why the ketogenic diet has been shown to decrease
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=495s)** — 50% of the fat on your liver within two weeks.
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=499s)** — How can it do that?
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=500s)** — Because when you actually decrease the glucose,
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=502s)** — you switch the body into ketones, and within even six days,
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=508s)** — you're improving significantly insulin resistance on your liver.
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=512s)** — So now everything's going to start working.
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=514s)** — You're also going to have decreased inflammation in the liver.
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=517s)** — You're going to have less fibrosis.
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=518s)** — You're going to have improved liver function and decreased liver enzymes.
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=522s)** — And I'm going to put some links down below to just show you that I'm
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=525s)** — I'm not just making this up. All of this data is validated.
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=528s)** — In summary, you fix a fatty liver.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=531s)** — You fix your brain.
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=533s)** — You fix diabetes.
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=535s)** — If we want to just keep it simple.
- **[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=537s)** — All right. So what are some key things that you can do right now to turn this around?
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=541s)** — Get on the ketogenic diet.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=542s)** — Very simply, make the carbohydrates you eat vegetable carbohydrates.
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=547s)** — One type of carbohydrate is fiber.
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=550s)** — And vegetables have a lot of fiber.
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=551s)** — And fiber is one of the only things that will not increase insulin.
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=556s)** — So now you can have your carbohydrates as long as they're high fiber carbohydrates.
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=562s)** — And so when you eat a meal, I do recommend that you start with your vegetables first.
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=567s)** — Right. And your salad.
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=569s)** — That way you get a lot of the phytonutrients and other nutrients from those foods that can
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=573s)** — actually help to decrease the complications of the diabetes you have.
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=577s)** — Then you have your protein. Right.
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=580s)** — Protein is very important.
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=581s)** — Don't have like a high amount of protein.
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=583s)** — Have a moderate amount of protein.
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=585s)** — I think the best way to identify the amounts, to keep it really simple,
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=590s)** — is if you're female, have protein the size of the palm of your hand.
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=595s)** — If you are a male, consume twice that.
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=598s)** — Two pieces of protein the size of the palm of your hand.
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=602s)** — And I think it's a good idea to start with the vegetables first, then the protein.
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=605s)** — Because if you start with the protein first,
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=607s)** — a lot of times people won't consume those vegetables.
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=610s)** — Also add apple cider vinegar, like a tablespoon or two in a glass of water.
- **[10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=615s)** — And you drink that down.
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=617s)** — Not only is that going to help you with digestion,
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=619s)** — that is going to greatly help you with your blood sugars,
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=624s)** — specifically making insulin more sensitive.
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=628s)** — Apple cider vinegar is an amazing remedy for speeding up the process of
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=634s)** — reversing this insulin resistance situation.
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=636s)** — When you think about it, what is apple cider vinegar?
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=639s)** — It's acetic acid.
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=641s)** — Apple cider vinegar is actually a fatty acid.
- **[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=644s)** — It's a type of fat. We don't think about it as a type of fat.
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=648s)** — But fats in general are the other thing that doesn't stimulate insulin.
- **[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=653s)** — But with apple cider vinegar, you can actually use that to get energy.
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=657s)** — And you can use that as one strategy to speed up the process.
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=661s)** — And also there's some great data to show that acetic acid
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=664s)** — speeds up the removal of fat from your liver.
- **[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=668s)** — And I would also add some lemon as well because that would help you.
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=671s)** — Okay, next point.
- **[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=672s)** — Let your appetite dictate when you eat.
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=675s)** — You're going to find as you do this and you switch to ketones,
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=679s)** — you're going to lose your appetite and your cravings.
- **[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=680s)** — It's going to make it very easy to stay on this program.
- **[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=683s)** — So just don't eat if you're not hungry.
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=685s)** — And only eat when you're hungry.
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=686s)** — So really pay attention to your appetite because
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=689s)** — what we want to do is we want you to eat less, less frequent.
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=693s)** — We want you to avoid snacks because we want to get rid of this habit
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=696s)** — that we have to eat three times a day, which is absolutely not true.
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=700s)** — That we have to have these snacks to prevent hypoglycemia, which is not true.
- **[11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=704s)** — Because every time you eat, you stimulate insulin.
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=707s)** — And at the very maximum, I would only eat two meals a day.
- **[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=710s)** — This is going to greatly speed up getting rid of the fat off your liver
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=714s)** — and turning this whole diabetes thing upside down.
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=718s)** — It puts you in remission.
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=720s)** — We'll call it remission.
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=721s)** — And the last thing, just to put the icing on the cake,
- **[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=723s)** — is to implement exercise on a regular basis.
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=727s)** — Exercise will greatly help you with insulin resistance,
- **[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=730s)** — actually improve the resistance, making insulin more sensitive.
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=734s)** — All right, so I hope I gave you a new viewpoint on this diabetes thing and
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=737s)** — how to reverse it.
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=739s)** — Now all you need to do is get the details of how to do it.
- **[12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCH6M6vZk&t=742s)** — And for that information, I put it up right here.
