- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=0s)** — I don't know if you realize this but there's this one protein that can raise insulin way more than
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=8s)** — white bread, way more than actual glucose. That protein is whey protein. So today let's discuss
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=16s)** — whey protein and is it good? Is it bad? What's my thoughts on it? What about... can it knock you
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=22s)** — out of ketosis? So white bread can increase the insulin by 87 percent and if we compare that to
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=29s)** — whey protein powder that can increase insulin by a factor of 139 percent. Now normally when we eat
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=37s)** — sugar, the blood sugar goes up and then insulin comes in there and pushes it down. But whey
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=44s)** — protein is not sugar. It is amino acids. Then those amino acids get absorbed very, very quickly
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=52s)** — and so they have an interesting fact because they raise insulin but apparently they don't spike
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=57s)** — your blood sugars. In fact there's been studies that show that if you're eating
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=63s)** — whey protein after a meal it can actually help lower your blood sugars so potentially help a
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=68s)** — diabetic. Now I don't know if that's true or not but the point is if... just think about it...
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=73s)** — if you're consuming something that raises insulin it's going to then push blood sugars down. The
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=79s)** — other thing about whey protein powder is that it also at the same time when it increases
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=84s)** — insulin it increases another opposing hormone called glucagon which tends to kind of neutralize
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=92s)** — some of the maybe bad effects of insulin. I think a question that people want to know
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=96s)** — is this... would whey protein knock me out of ketosis? And the answer is well yes because
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=104s)** — anything that increases insulin will knock you out of ketosis. And then of course the next
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=109s)** — question is will whey protein powder increase weight gain? Well I don't think it does because
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=115s)** — we're not necessarily converting glucose into fat. What we are doing is we're increasing
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=121s)** — insulin which has whether or not a lot of positive benefits especially if someone has
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=127s)** — insulin resistance. In fact if you take a look at all of the symptoms that relate to insulin
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=131s)** — resistance they're really a deficiency of insulin. Why? Because with insulin resistance
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=137s)** — you have the resistance and it takes greater and greater amounts of insulin to create the same
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=144s)** — effect. So the question is will whey protein powder create insulin resistance? Well it's a
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=151s)** — little bit of a mixed review because you know a lot of times when people take whey protein
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=155s)** — powder they also exercise at the same time. Exercise improves insulin resistance. So the
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=165s)** — whey protein powder does stimulate muscle growth but it also at the same time stimulates a lot of
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=171s)** — other things because it actually creates a hormonal effect on your body. So it may stimulate other
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=176s)** — organs not just your muscles like the prostate for example. There's also been some data
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=182s)** — that it can protect the liver. Other data that says that it worsens the liver. It can
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=188s)** — create inflammation in the liver. Increasing liver enzymes especially if you take it without
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=194s)** — exercising. So there is a bit of mixed reviews on exactly what it does and what it doesn't do.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=200s)** — So would I recommend taking whey protein powder? Personally for me I don't take it because I
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=205s)** — don't feel good on it. I also know that whey protein powder is out of the natural
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=211s)** — milk complex. So it doesn't have the casein in it. It doesn't have any other nutrients in
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=217s)** — versus like if you had a fermented dairy like cheese right? It has everything in it plus
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=224s)** — additional microbes. So whey protein powder is kind of considered like a refined product but
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=229s)** — for some people it can create some positive effects on their muscles allowing amino acids to
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=235s)** — go into the cells a little bit better maybe after a workout. But on the flip side
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=239s)** — you have the whole egg and you also have meat and you have fish which are a better quality of
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=247s)** — amino acids. Plus you get a lot of additional nutrients with that. Plus you have less of an
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=252s)** — insulin spike but for certain people maybe in competition with bodybuilding, well they
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=258s)** — swear by it and it apparently does help them. So you might just want to experiment for yourself
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=263s)** — and see if it does help you and how you feel after taking it. But I wanted to give you
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=267s)** — some additional data on whey protein that you may have not heard before. Now since we're
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=273s)** — on the topic of dairy okay and let's say you're on the ketogenic plan. If you haven't seen this
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJqVCJYqys&t=279s)** — video you should probably check it out. I put it up right here.
