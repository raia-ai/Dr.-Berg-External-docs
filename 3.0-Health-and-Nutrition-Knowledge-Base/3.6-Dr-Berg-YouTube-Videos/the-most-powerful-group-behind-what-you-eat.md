- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=0s)** — Today we are going to discuss the most powerful group behind what you eat.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=5s)** — And you might even think that they are like the top brands that you see in the grocery store.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=8s)** — But they are not the real big players. They are actually four companies that control
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=16s)** — 90% of the grain trade. And I am talking about products made from corn, soy, wheat, sugar,
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=24s)** — rice. You have to realize that these commodities make up like 68% of the average person's calories,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=33s)** — at least in the United States. And this group is composed of four companies. They are kind of
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=38s)** — silent giants because a lot of people do not even know that they exist. They are the
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=43s)** — extremely powerful and influential middlemen between the farmers who they heavily control,
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=50s)** — as well as the other brands that you know about like Nestle and Kellogg's, etc. And they have
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=55s)** — huge influence over commodities. Well, commodities are like a stock market for crops. I mean,
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=61s)** — I have a tiny bit of experience with commodities. I had no business going into the commodity
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=66s)** — market. There are still skid marks on the turnpike going right into Philadelphia. When my
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=73s)** — wife was driving with all these kids in the backseat, I thought that was the best time to
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=77s)** — tell her that, honey, I lost all of our savings in the commodities market. Well, she slammed on
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=83s)** — the brakes and there was a little island of land right next to this major freeway that she
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=90s)** — pulled off of. She gets out of the car, she walks up and down this little piece of land.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=94s)** — Let's just say she was extremely upset and she had to let out some steam, and rightfully so.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=98s)** — And the whole thing is very confusing. But these four companies have a huge influence on
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=104s)** — what those prices are set at. And they get themselves into a really good situation because
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=111s)** — $700 billion a year are spent on subsidies for commodities like corn, wheat,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=119s)** — soybean. Now, there's a really interesting study in the American Journal of Agricultural
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=123s)** — Economics. If we're giving them $700 billion a year, that should allow us to buy this food
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=130s)** — for a lot cheaper. For every dollar of corn subsidy, the resulting decrease in corn prices
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=137s)** — only led to a two cents reduction. Wait a second. That's not fair. I just gave you a dollar
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=143s)** — and I'm getting two cents back. Let's say you want to go buy a donut at the store and
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=147s)** — these donuts are a dollar. Okay, so you go to the store and what you might not realize is
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=153s)** — that you already spent $1.95 for that donut. And you didn't know it because it indirectly
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=158s)** — came through your paying for your taxes and you bought the raw materials to make it. And
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=163s)** — then you spend your dollar. So the total amount of money that you spent for that donut is $2.95.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=168s)** — Then of course, when you eat the donut, you eventually have health problems. You have to go
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=172s)** — to the doctor and pay the doctor to fix your blood sugars, your high blood pressure, your
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=176s)** — high cholesterol, dementia, your heartburn. But thank goodness you have insurance, right? But
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=182s)** — the point is that these companies got themselves in a really good situation because a lot of
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=186s)** — raw materials are paid for by you in advance. So the four companies, ABCD, the first one is
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=194s)** — called Archer Daniels Midland, and then Bungee, and then Cargill, and then Louis Dreyfus.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=202s)** — Those are the four companies that pretty much own the grain trade. They're the companies
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=208s)** — that supply 68% of your calories. And what's really wild is the junk food brands also own
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=215s)** — a lot of the organic and natural brands as well, as well as pet food and the vitamin and
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=222s)** — supplement companies as well. Now what's even more bizarre is if we kind of just lump together
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=227s)** — the three main ingredients in 99% of all junk food, we have starches, we have sugars,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=234s)** — we have seed oils, right? And we know the sugars are there to sweeten something
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=238s)** — and they're highly addictive. And it will keep you craving for more sweets the more you eat
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=243s)** — them, right? The seed oils originated long ago in the 1800s with cotton seed oil. They were
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=250s)** — trying to figure out what to do with this waste. And so they decided to use it as a fuel.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=257s)** — And then they decided, well, let's just put it in the food supply. And that was the start
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=261s)** — of repurposing a waste product from something else. And then we have starches, right? What's
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=268s)** — the purpose of a starch? The purpose of a starch is to add bulk to the product. It's not even
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=273s)** — sweet, even though a starch is a chain of sugar. I mean, it's one thing to add a filler
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=279s)** — for a product to kind of bulk up so you can sell it at a cheaper amount. But it's another
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=284s)** — thing to sell a filler that can create more of a spike on the glycemic index than actual
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=292s)** — by a factor of 185. So if we're comparing certain sugars to starches like cane sugar
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=297s)** — on the glycemic index, it's 65 for sugar. But then for maltodextrin, for example, that can
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=304s)** — go all the way up to 185. So think about what that's doing to your health. This so-called
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=311s)** — benign filler is creating major problems and it's in so many foods. I started looking
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=318s)** — through ultra-processed foods to see how much of the starch was present. And I got numbers from
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=324s)** — anywhere between 35 to 60 percent of the calories were these starches. This video is really
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=332s)** — about increasing the awareness of who's really controlling the food supply. And so this entire
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=338s)** — system of subsidizing certain crops started during the depression. They should have stopped
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=344s)** — right there, but they kept going. And now we have a system that really does not benefit you
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=349s)** — because you're buying certain ingredients at the expense of your own health with other companies
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=356s)** — majorly benefiting from your tax dollars. So it might sound like there's nothing you can do,
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=361s)** — but there is something you can do. The market follows the demand. That means the market
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=368s)** — follows what you buy. If you keep buying these products, this system will stay in existence forever.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=374s)** — If you stop buying these products, you basically decrease the demand and the market will go in
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=379s)** — another direction. And so what I'm really trying to communicate is that you need to go
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=383s)** — on a low-carb ketogenic diet not just for your own health, but to influence this system,
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4jfBoOXNs8&t=391s)** — which I think is extremely corrupted. If you want to know exactly where to start, you can
