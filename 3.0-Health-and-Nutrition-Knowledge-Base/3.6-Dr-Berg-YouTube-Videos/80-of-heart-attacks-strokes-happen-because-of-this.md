- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=0s)** — Over 80% of heart attacks and strokes are not plaque, cholesterol, or calcium that's blocking your arteries.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=7s)** — Most of the time when someone has a heart attack or a stroke, they die from a clot.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=13s)** — This is not the same and it's very different than a buildup of cholesterol or calcium or plaque.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=19s)** — If someone told you the reason why you die is your arteries fill up with cholesterol,
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=23s)** — they are lying to you. That's usually not what kills you. It's the clot that can form in less
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=28s)** — than five seconds. What we're going to do today is we're going to really dissect a clot and
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=33s)** — understand what it is and give you a solution to prevent clots because a clot is a very
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=39s)** — necessary thing. A clot is a response to injury and the way it's supposed to work is the body
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=44s)** — is supposed to form a clot, fix the hole in the artery, and then dissolve it. The real problem
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=51s)** — that we need to focus on is the hole in the artery, but the biggest trigger to a clot is not
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=56s)** — it's not calcium. Number one, and people know this, is the inhalation of smoke from
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=62s)** — cigarette smoke. Now your arteries are exposed to all these chemicals and it's going to create
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=66s)** — inflammation. Also, pollution or being around any type of chemicals in the environment can do
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=71s)** — that as well. A solution is not to do vaping. Okay, you need to just stop smoking. Alcohol is
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=77s)** — another one. You're drinking alcohol. It's considered a poison to the liver. It gets into
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=81s)** — the bloodstream and that also can create problems in the inside of the arteries. Believe
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=85s)** — it or not, birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy is another thing that can
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=90s)** — actually affect the arteries because of the hormonal interaction, increasing the risk of
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=95s)** — a stroke and heart attacks. Then you have stress and this is an interesting one because
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=100s)** — there's something called the broken heart syndrome where someone has a loss of a loved
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=106s)** — one and their risk of having a heart attack goes up by 2000 percent, which by the way
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=111s)** — triggers the clotting action. Anything that increases stress can increase the clotting
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=116s)** — action. But also surgery. Okay, surgery is a very stressful thing to the body and
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=122s)** — endurance sports, marathons. It's a tremendous stress in your body and refined starches.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=128s)** — That's just like pure inflammation going to your arteries and this is why diabetics are
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=133s)** — at four to five times the risk for getting clots, not just in the heart but in the brain
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=137s)** — The last thing that can trigger these clots is an infection. It could come from an infection
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=144s)** — in your tooth from a failed root canal where you have this abscess that's leaking bacteria
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=150s)** — into the body or it can come from some other chronic infection. I think for most people it's
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=155s)** — going to be the high levels of sugar that's flowing through their bloodstream that's
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=159s)** — creating the problem because of their diet and it makes their blood really sticky. Also it
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=163s)** — chronically elevates inflammation. Inflammation is one of the most potent things for clotting.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=169s)** — There's another trigger for this clot as well. An excess amount of calcium in the arteries.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=175s)** — Now let me explain this because in certain studies involving post-menopausal women who
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=179s)** — take high amounts of calcium for their bones, they have an increased risk of getting
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=184s)** — this clot because calcium is involved in over 15 different clotting factors. I'm talking about
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=191s)** — excess calcium. Excess calcium is just not good for the heart. It can cause excessive
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=195s)** — calcification in the soft tissues especially in the arteries. As the antidote and the thing that
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=200s)** — kind of counters this clotting, there's two things that are very very important to know.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=205s)** — Number one is vitamin K2. The purpose of vitamin K2 is to keep the calcium from building
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=210s)** — up in the soft tissue. K2 is all about keeping the calcium out of the arteries and
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=216s)** — the arteries. And guess where vitamin K2 comes from? Dairy, butter, it comes from fatty foods.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=221s)** — The exact things that they tell you to avoid because of the cholesterol. You should always
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=225s)** — take vitamin D with vitamin K2 simply because vitamin D is super important as an anti-inflammatory
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=232s)** — in the inside of the arteries and it works together with vitamin K2. Magnesium is another
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=237s)** — very important calcium regulator and it prevents calcium from going inside the tissues. Magnesium
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=245s)** — helps prevent arrhythmias especially atrial fibrillation which by the way causes an arrhythmic
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=251s)** — problem in the heart that can cause pooling of the blood that can increase your risk of
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=257s)** — getting a clot. What turns down clotting? The big one is something called nitric oxide. Here are
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=265s)** — some things that can increase nitric oxide. Vitamin D. L-Arginine is an amino acid that
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=270s)** — nitric oxide and one of the best sources of L-Arginine is meat and liver. The exact things
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=278s)** — that they tell you not to eat. There's something else that increases nitric oxide,
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=283s)** — sunlight that can penetrate deep into the body and help increase nitric oxide in the inside
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=289s)** — of the arteries. This is why getting sun is so valuable in so many different ways. Not just
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=296s)** — but other ways as well. What's happened since 1980 is we become sun phobic because we're
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=301s)** — afraid of getting melanoma which is an absolute lie. You want to get regular doses of sun.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=307s)** — Very therapeutic to the heart. Other things that can help you is polyphenols and natural
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=313s)** — herbs and vegetables. Vitamin C. Omega 3. Omega 3 fatty acids naturally thin the blood. Also,
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=321s)** — when people consume leafy green vegetables that are high in vitamin K1, they think,
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=325s)** — oh that's a lot of vitamin K1 that's gonna cause clotting. It's gonna thicken my blood.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=330s)** — No, it's not going to create thickening more than normal. It's just gonna bring you to a
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=335s)** — normal level. It's not gonna create excessive amount of clotting. Fasting is another potent
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=340s)** — way to help reduce the risk of clotting. Fasting is also anti-inflammatory. Ketones,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=347s)** — getting on the ketogenic diet, a low-carb diet, is also anti-inflammatory to your arteries.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=352s)** — Regular exercise, and I'm not talking about like high stressful exercise where you're
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=358s)** — doing marathons, but regular good exercise with good recovery is extremely important
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=364s)** — in preventing this clotting. Garlic and onion. Super important in preventing clotting. As far
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=371s)** — as supplements go, there's three that are really powerful. Natokinase is a natural
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=377s)** — enzyme that helps prevent clotting. You also have another enzyme called seropeptase. That's
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=382s)** — an extract from silkworms. And then bromelain from pineapple. When you take those enzymes to
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=387s)** — help reduce clotting, and I'm not even recommending you take them unless you have a
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=392s)** — clotting problem, but they're a great natural source that's not endorsed by big pharma
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=397s)** — because they're competitive, you want to take those on an empty stomach so it can actually
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=401s)** — work on the factors in your blood that's maybe too excessive. Now you know the basics of what
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=408s)** — really is behind most heart attacks and strokes. Follow the advice. I hope you took notes and
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=413s)** — implement the data that I showed you in this video. Thanks for watching and I will see you
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW8Cu4vcReY&t=418s)** — in the next video.
