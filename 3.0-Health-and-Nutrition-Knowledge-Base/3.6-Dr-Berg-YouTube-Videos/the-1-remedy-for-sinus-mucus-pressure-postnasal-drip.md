- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=0s)** — I have a lot of videos on what to do for mucus, especially upper respiratory mucus, sinuses.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=6s)** — But this video is going to give you another tip that is very, very powerful.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=11s)** — And I think you'll like it and it's very effective.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=14s)** — So if you have post-nasal drip, chronic rhinitis or sinusitis or sinus pressure or
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=21s)** — sinus headaches or cluster headaches or even sinus allergies, okay, this can apply to you.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=28s)** — An average person might do the steroids, they might do medication, which always creates more
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=33s)** — side effects, or they might do the surgery and the complications from that are pretty huge.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=38s)** — But there's another thing you can do that is very powerful and you can either do it
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=44s)** — as a nasal spray or you can consume this food. And I'm talking about like hot peppers,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=52s)** — like cayenne or other hot spicy peppers. Now, there's this thing called pepper spray,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=59s)** — which is kind of like a weapon against people and you spray it in their eyes.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=64s)** — We're not talking about that concentration. We're talking about a very, very diluted
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=69s)** — cayenne pepper or it could be horseradish or other types of pepper in a spray that can
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=77s)** — improve your sonesis. And I'm going to talk about this. The main phytonutrient in these
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=83s)** — peppers that is doing all the magic is called capsaicin. You know, when you eat these hot
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=90s)** — peppers, it's that phytonutrient that creates this hot sensation. It has nothing to do with
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=96s)** — increasing the temperature. It's all a chemical signal that tells the brain that it's very
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=103s)** — hot. And it's the plant's defense mechanism to get predators to not eat that plant.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=110s)** — And so there's different levels of hot. Okay. But what's interesting is that the tarantula
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=116s)** — venom uses the same pathway. And so that would make sense because there are peppers
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=122s)** — that are so hot that will literally like burn your mouth and can create a serious problem
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=129s)** — your breathing and everything else. You're sweating and some people can tolerate them,
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=133s)** — some people don't. But there's some great research on what capsaicin can do for your
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=141s)** — sonesis. Other people get it as a cream and they put it on their body for pain and
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=145s)** — arthritis and like rheumatoid or osteo or even gout. But there's actually nasal sprays that have
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=152s)** — some cayenne pepper, very diluted or a concentrated extract giving you this capsaicin.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=159s)** — That you can spray into your sonesis. And so if you look at the research,
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=163s)** — it can definitely help purge mucus from your sonesis. It will help drain off this mucus
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=170s)** — versus some of the medications that suppress the mucus. This one kind of purges it out,
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=177s)** — but it then reduces the nasal hyper reactivity. So you're going to find that your
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=183s)** — mucus membranes are not reacting nearly as much as they were before to the environment,
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=189s)** — whether it's an allergy or something else that's creating this mucus. So it can help
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=195s)** — open the sonesis, drain the sonesis, and it can help desensitize the mucus membranes.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=203s)** — Okay, so they, like I said before, now they're not as sensitive. So that irritation,
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=209s)** — that redness, that inflammation goes away. Not to mention having another property of
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=214s)** — antimicrobial. So many people who have a chronic sinus problems, chronic rhinitis,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=220s)** — have like a fungus growing in their sinuses or even a bacterial infection.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=225s)** — Now you have a couple choices. You can use it as a nasal spray or you can start consuming
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=231s)** — these peppers. Okay, and it will create a very similar effect. I tried an experiment long
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=237s)** — ago, which I will never repeat. I actually drank 12 ounces of daikon radish juice. Okay.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=245s)** — And I had so much mucus drainage. I didn't even know that much mucus could be drained out of
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=252s)** — your sinuses, but it just came out. And then I noticed about an hour later, boy, it just
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=257s)** — dried right up. So radishes can be used too. They're pretty spicy. And any peppers that are
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=262s)** — will do the trick. Now, sometimes when people consume these peppers,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=268s)** — it's so hot, they have to neutralize this, this hot burning in their mouth. So they start
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=272s)** — drinking more water. Water is just going to intensify this hot sensation. Another remedy,
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=280s)** — which is even better than milk, but milk will help neutralize it. Okay. Some people use ice
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=285s)** — cream, but I recommend milk, but there's something even better than milk, because it's
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=291s)** — casein, the milk protein that is the antidote. Okay. To this burning sensation in the receptors.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=300s)** — So what has the most casein? And the answer is cottage cheese. That's right. Cottage cheese
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=308s)** — is just loaded with casein. But I wanted to give you another remedy that you can do. If
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=312s)** — you have this chronic sinus problem, that's pretty easy and it's pretty highly effective.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=317s)** — I've done another video on mucus, not just in the sonuses, but mucus that can drain onto the
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=323s)** — lungs. And that actually got a lot of views. If you haven't seen that, I put it up right here.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKF0954tfxs&t=329s)** — Check it out.
