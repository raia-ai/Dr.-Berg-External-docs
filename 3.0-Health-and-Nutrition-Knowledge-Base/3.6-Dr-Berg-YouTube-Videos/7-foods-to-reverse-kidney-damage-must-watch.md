- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the seven best foods to prevent and reverse kidney damage.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=5s)** — The kidney is a filter. This one on the left is a dirty kidney. This one on the right is a clean
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=10s)** — kidney. We're going to show you how to go from this to this using foods. I think the biggest
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=16s)** — myth about the kidney is this topic of potassium. I don't know how this started, but people tend
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=21s)** — to think that potassium is really bad for the kidney. You have to avoid potassium foods
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=26s)** — if you want to protect the kidney. That is absolutely not true. Potassium actually protects
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=32s)** — the kidney from damage. The only time you wouldn't want to take potassium is when you started to get
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=37s)** — advanced stage kidney disease. You need to consume a lot of potassium since our bodies
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=42s)** — require 4,700 milligrams a day. A couple ways that the potassium helps the kidney other than
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=49s)** — directly protecting kidney damage is this. Potassium lowers your blood pressure. And having
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=55s)** — high blood pressure is one of the main things that destroys the kidney. If you have an imbalance
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=58s)** — with sodium and you don't have enough potassium, that can also be hard on the kidney. The way to
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=64s)** — handle the sodium on the kidney is simply to increase your potassium. Potassium can help
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=68s)** — protect you against kidney stones because it can lower the incidence of oxalates binding with
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=75s)** — calcium. The real bad things that damage the kidney. Number one, and this is the biggest one,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=80s)** — consuming a lot of sugar, starches, things like that. Because all that sugar in your blood
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=84s)** — ends up in the kidney and it creates a lot of oxidation. And you can visualize that as something
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=90s)** — that's rusting out the kidney, damaging that little filter. Other things that will destroy
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=94s)** — the kidney, alcohol, NSAIDs like ibuprofen, medications. A lot of medications are synthetic,
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=101s)** — prednisone or even antibiotics. Getting too many pesticides from the foods, heavy metals,
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=107s)** — food dyes, and too much phosphorus from soda. Really damaging to the kidney. Being in
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=113s)** — a diet with enough vitamin D and potassium and even magnesium can greatly help that. I'm going
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=119s)** — to show you all the different foods that you should be eating that can help reverse a lot of
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=124s)** — the things I'm talking about. Number one is really a category of key vegetables that are
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=128s)** — really important with kidney function. Asparagus. Some people don't like it but if you can consume
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=134s)** — it, it's really good for the kidney. It has a certain enzyme that helps to detoxify the kidneys.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=140s)** — The next vegetable I would recommend is celery. Celery also has things in it to greatly improve
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=146s)** — kidney function. Bell peppers are loaded with vitamin C and a lot of other good nutrients for
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=150s)** — the kidney. Cabbage is another really good vegetable for the kidney. Cauliflower is another
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=155s)** — great vegetable. Garlic is loaded with allicin which is really good for kidney function.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=161s)** — There are plenty of other vegetables but these are the ones that are very low in something
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=165s)** — called oxalates. Spinach is high in oxalates. You can have spinach but I would recommend having
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=170s)** — it with cheese because those oxalates could irritate the kidney. And the most common kidney
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=175s)** — stone is calcium oxalate stones. And one great remedy for that is increasing your magnesium.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=183s)** — This is number two. Magnesium rich foods. Pumpkin seeds, anything leafy greens, avocados
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=189s)** — are all high in magnesium. I would, as a side note, also consume magnesium glycinate at least
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=195s)** — 400 milligrams per day because that magnesium also helps protect the kidney and it does a
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=200s)** — lot of additional things for the kidney indirectly. Number three. Probiotic foods.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=206s)** — Kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi. On top of that there are two microbes that have a
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=219s)** — The first one is lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium longum. Both of those have
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=227s)** — been extensively used to help take the stress off the kidney. I would highly recommend them.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=231s)** — Number four. Having not just a high quality protein source, also not overdoing it. Adding
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=237s)** — more protein could stress it a little bit more. If you're seeing excess waste from protein in
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=243s)** — your blood or your urine, you're consuming too much protein. Cut down the amount of
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=248s)** — You don't want to go low. You want to go a moderate amount of protein. Maybe you do six to
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=253s)** — seven ounces per meal. And as far as the source goes, wild caught fish, sardines, and
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=259s)** — cod liver would also give you the omega-3. That's good for the kidney as well. And then
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=263s)** — also eggs. Number five. High antioxidant foods. Blueberries, blackberries, raspberries,
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=269s)** — strawberries, beets are really good for the kidney as well. To counter some of this
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=274s)** — rusting out effect that happens just having high blood sugar or other things. Number six.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=279s)** — Quercetin. Quercetin has some really great properties for the kidney. And the best source
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=284s)** — of quercetin is white onions, red onions. I consume a lot of onions and you can saute them,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=291s)** — eat them raw. Quercetin has an anti-inflammatory effect. It also then will prevent scar tissue
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=298s)** — in the kidney. It tends to put the fire out if there's oxidative stress. So just cook your
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=302s)** — onions or add onions to the meal. And number seven. Extra virgin olive oil. When it comes to
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=309s)** — olive oil, there are certain things in olive oil, certain chemical compounds that are just dynamite
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=314s)** — for inflammation, kidney support. And it's even good for kidney stones. And I've sampled a lot
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=321s)** — of different olive oils and there's a lot of good ones out there. And of course, my
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=324s)** — favorite is the one from Italy. I will put a link down below of the one that I use. It's
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=328s)** — charts as far as quality. As far as drinking liquid, it's also true if you're consuming
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=334s)** — too much liquid, that's not good for the kidney because it causes the kidney to work
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=338s)** — too hard. You need that sweet spot right in the middle. One additional little tip I'm going
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=342s)** — to recommend when you drink liquid. Pre-make some tea. Keep it in the fridge and consume
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=348s)** — tea as your main liquid because the polyphenols in tea do a lot for the kidney. These
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=355s)** — polyphenols also can bind with excessive iron that can damage the kidney. And of course,
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=361s)** — I'm not just recommending getting the tea that has the most caffeine or any caffeine,
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=365s)** — but there's a lot of different teas that can help the kidney. Green tea, but if I'm not
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=368s)** — mistaken, green tea might have caffeine, so you might want to not overdo that one.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=372s)** — Nettle tea is a great anti-inflammatory tea. Dandelion tea is really good as well. It'll
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=378s)** — help act as a diuretic to get rid of excess fluid. Turmeric tea or even a black tea that
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=383s)** — is naturally decaffeinated. The last point I want to make is think about this. The kidney
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=387s)** — is a filter of your blood and you're eating food frequently. It is going to overtax the
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=393s)** — filtration. It's not a bad idea to do intermittent fasting to support the kidney
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=397s)** — for two reasons. Number one, you can decrease the stress on the kidney by just not forcing it
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=402s)** — to work so hard. And secondly, intermittent fasting will drop insulin considerably to the
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=408s)** — point where your kidneys can start to heal because one of the big culprits for damage to your
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=413s)** — kidney is too much insulin. You definitely want to do a combination of low carb,
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knY-Foaeqlg&t=418s)** — intermittent fasting with this program. And if you want information on that,
