- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=0s)** — You know, a lot of people eat sardines. They're very healthy. I consume them. They're great.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=6s)** — A very good source of omega-3 fatty acids. But I want to introduce you to another food that has even higher amounts of omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=14s)** — Cod liver. I recommend you have both, because they both have their own strengths.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=20s)** — But so many people have never even heard about cod liver. I think they're missing out.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=24s)** — Now, I want to first touch on this cod liver oil thing. Because why do they have cod liver oil?
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=32s)** — And why don't they promote other fish liver oil type products?
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=37s)** — And that is because something's very unique about the cod fish. In the muscle of the cod fish, there's not much oil.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=45s)** — Why is that? Because all of the oil is in the cod's liver, not the muscle.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=50s)** — In a salmon, they have small livers, not as much oil, hardly at all. Most of it is in the muscle meat.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=58s)** — So let's start with the omega-3 fatty acids. That would be both EPA and DHA.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=64s)** — EPA is more for inflammation, and DHA is more for brain, nerve, heart.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=70s)** — So with omega-3 fats, with sardines, we're dealing with 0.9 to 2 grams of omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=79s)** — Versus cod liver, we're dealing with 9 to 11 grams of omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=85s)** — So hands down, cod liver has way more omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=89s)** — Alright, next one is vitamin D. Sardines will give you 4.8 micrograms.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=94s)** — That basically gives you like 24% of your RDAs.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=97s)** — Yet on the cod liver side, we're talking about 100 micrograms.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=102s)** — So 4.8 micrograms to 100 micrograms for cod liver. That's going to give you 500% of the RDA.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=109s)** — Next one is vitamin A. I'm not talking about beta-carotene, I'm talking about the active form called retinol.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=114s)** — Vitamin A is for your vision, vision at night especially, the inner mucosal membranes of your mouth, your throat, your sinuses, your lungs.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=124s)** — Also, vitamin A is very important for your thyroid. And also, vitamin A works with iodine.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=129s)** — In fact, if you're low in vitamin A, your thyroid could enlarge.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=134s)** — So with sardines, you get about 32 micrograms. But with cod liver, we're talking about 5,100 micrograms.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=144s)** — Which is about 638% of the RDAs. So sardines is 4%, cod liver is 638%.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=152s)** — Alright, now let's go to protein, actual protein. We have 24.6 grams. On the cod liver side, we only have 4.6 grams, much lower.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=162s)** — So 24.6 to 4.6. Sardines have much more protein. And that's probably because cod liver is mostly fat.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=170s)** — Alright, next one is folate, a very important vitamin, vitamin B9. Sardines, 10 micrograms. Cod liver, 300 micrograms.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=183s)** — Okay, now let's talk about calcium. On the sardine side, we have 392 milligrams. And on the cod liver side, we only have 10 milligrams.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=191s)** — Okay, so sardines have much more calcium. Let's talk about phosphorus. On the sardine side, we have 545 milligrams.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=200s)** — Versus the cod liver side, we only have 100 milligrams. 545 milligrams to 100 milligrams for the cod liver.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=207s)** — And then we get to B12. On the sardine side, we're dealing with 11 micrograms. And on the cod liver, we're dealing with slightly less, like 10.6 micrograms.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=218s)** — So as far as the B12, it's almost the same, just a little bit more on the sardine side. So now do you see why you need both?
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=225s)** — Because cod liver oil has some things that the sardines don't have, and the sardines have things that the cod liver doesn't have.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=231s)** — And then if we look at sardines relating to salmon, okay, the salmon does have more B vitamins, but the sardines have more calcium, more phosphorus, more selenium, more iron, more magnesium, and more zinc.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGOYN148Mg&t=245s)** — Now if you have not seen my video on the benefits of cod liver oil, you should check it out. I put it up right here.
