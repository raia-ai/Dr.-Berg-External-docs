- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=0s)** — I'm going to cover the 16 signs that your body needs more nutrition. Now the problem is when I
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=5s)** — teach you this information, you're probably going to want to evaluate your friends and family and
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=9s)** — neighbors. If you do that, don't mention my name. Sometimes it offends people if you're talking
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=14s)** — about certain, I don't know, skin problems they have on their nose or something like that. So
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=20s)** — we're going to dive through all 16, but you need to kind of know first of all why people
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=23s)** — are deficient. It could be because you're just not eating nutrient-dense foods or you're eating
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=28s)** — foods that are grown on soils that don't have the right nutrition or even like grown in water,
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=33s)** — like hydroponic. You can also be deficient if you have genetic weaknesses or if you have low
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=39s)** — stomach acid and you can't break down certain things like proteins and you can't extract
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=44s)** — minerals or let's say for example you don't have a gallbladder or you have a gallbladder
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=48s)** — problem, you're not going to be able to absorb vitamin A, D, E, and K. All right,
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=54s)** — we go. Let's dive right in. Number one, brittle nails. This usually means low protein and this
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=62s)** — is common in horses because a horse will keep eating until it gets enough protein and sometimes
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=67s)** — if there's too much carbohydrate in the grass like in the spring, they'll end up eating too
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=72s)** — much just because they're trying to get enough protein. In the process, they get too many
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=76s)** — carbs and this is really common in humans. We keep eating until we get enough protein and
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=81s)** — if you're eating a bag of chips, for example, it has no protein, it's very easy to down many
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=86s)** — bags of chips because we constantly are trying to fulfill this protein requirement. All right,
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=91s)** — number two, blue sclera. And what's happening is you are iron deficient, anemic. The whites
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=99s)** — of your eyes are starting to turn blue and you're seeing this transparent collagen which
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=105s)** — allows us to see the venous part of your blood which is blue. All right, if you have
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=110s)** — pain in the tip of your scapula on the right side, that means you are deficient in bile from
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=117s)** — the gallbladder. And if you're deficient in bile, you'll tend to develop gallstones. All right,
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=124s)** — the next one is tetany. It's that little twitch that just kind of twitches underneath
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=127s)** — the left eye or could be an arm. What that is is a magnesium deficiency. Magnesium regulates
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=134s)** — this amount of calcium. And so now we don't have the normal contraction and relaxation going on
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=141s)** — because the lack of magnesium accelerates the nerve impulses. So you get this like this extra
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=147s)** — twitching thing that goes on in your body. Next one, flaky scaly skin. That is a classic
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=154s)** — omega-3 deficiency. It also could mean you're consuming too much of the omega-6 because they
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=162s)** — as in too much soy oil or corn oil or canola or cottonseed oil or safflower oil or sunflower oil.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=170s)** — Instead you want to have more like fish oil especially like cod liver oil. Next one is high
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=175s)** — blood pressure. The first deficiency that I would look at is a potassium deficiency.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=183s)** — Potassium supports the tone of the arteries. It helps keep the arteries softened and it
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=190s)** — also helps reduce adrenaline and reduce the sympathetic nervous system that fight or flight
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=196s)** — mechanism that keeps your blood pressure high. Also potassium helps regulate the fluids
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=203s)** — especially balancing out sodium. Alright next one is excessive worry. This is a classic
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=212s)** — B1 deficiency. If you took some B1 you would feel really calm and you wouldn't worry as
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=218s)** — even though there's something to worry about your worrying is going to be a lot less. Alright next
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=224s)** — one is hyperthyroidism. The deficiency for this one is boron. Now if you were going to take
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=229s)** — boron I would recommend you also take it with all of the trace minerals at the same time so
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=235s)** — that way you don't knock out another trace mineral because they all tend to work together.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=239s)** — But boron is good for a lot of different things. It's actually in borax like laundry
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=244s)** — but boron is also important for your bone health. It helps increase magnesium absorption
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=250s)** — and it can also reduce inflammation but it's also good for someone who has a hyper
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=256s)** — thyroid problem. Alright next one is hypothyroidism. The key trace mineral for this
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=263s)** — that's usually deficient is something called selenium. Selenium allows the conversion from
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=268s)** — T4 to the T3 the active form of the thyroid hormone. So when you think about Hashimoto's
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=275s)** — think selenium. Next one is hip clicking or joint clicking. If you're getting this
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=281s)** — excessive clicking the deficiency in this situation is vitamin D3. Now to fix it you
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=288s)** — have to increase your vitamin D3 to at least 20,000 IUs or more because one really
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=295s)** — interesting function of vitamin D3 is remodeling of the joint. Pretty wild eh? Alright next one is
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=302s)** — low testosterone. This is a classic zinc deficiency. Zinc will increase testosterone.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=310s)** — The way you become deficient with zinc is eating too many grains because of the phytic acid
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=315s)** — or too much refined sugar. One of the best foods for zinc is red meat or shellfish or seafood.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=323s)** — Alright next one is your hair is just taking way too long to grow. What's deficient in this
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=330s)** — situation usually is manganese. Okay the trace mineral called manganese. Again anytime you take
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=338s)** — a trace mineral take it in a blend of all of the trace minerals. Next one is premature
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=345s)** — graying of your hair. This is usually a vitamin B5 deficiency. Now vitamin B5 is good also for
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=355s)** — your adrenals and of course the more support you have with the adrenals the less stress.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=361s)** — But vitamin B5 also supports this enzyme called catalase which can then help clear out more
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=368s)** — the hydrogen peroxide which can build up in the body. Next one is red gums. This is a classic
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=375s)** — vitamin C deficiency. It could also be that you're consuming too much sugar because vitamin
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=381s)** — C and sugar compete and one of the foods that has the most vitamin C is raw sauerkraut.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=388s)** — Next one is feeling weak. This is a sodium deficiency. You just need to consume more sea
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=395s)** — and last one is you're bruising easily. Okay this is a vitamin K1 deficiency. Now if you want to
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=401s)** — learn more about the different signs of nutritional deficiencies if you haven't seen
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecanOOf0SY&t=406s)** — this video it's very interesting. I'll put it up right here.
