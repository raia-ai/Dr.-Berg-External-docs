- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=0s)** — Kidney stones can be devastating. I mean, severe pain. So for those of you that
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=7s)** — had a kidney stone or are interested in preventing a kidney stone, this video is for you. I've talked
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=12s)** — a lot about kidney stones, but I have not emphasized this one really important factor
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=18s)** — based on a recent study that I just read, which is actually very fascinating. And it's
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=24s)** — including a very simple thing to your water. And that is called apple cider vinegar. Mostly
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=30s)** — apple cider vinegar is acetic acid. And so the question is how does acetic acid influence or
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=37s)** — help you dissolve a stone? Okay. Now, when we're dealing with kidney stones, we're dealing with
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=43s)** — mainly what's called calcium oxalate stones. Okay. But there's other stones too. You can
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=49s)** — have a uric acid stone. You can have stones made from other things, but mostly it's calcium
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=54s)** — oxalates. So I've done videos in oxalates. Oxalates are in a lot of different foods,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=59s)** — especially in the ketogenic diet. They're high in almonds. They're high in spinach and
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=65s)** — chocolate and kiwis. And then you have another factor of calcium in the urine, which can be
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=71s)** — genetic weakness, genetic mutation, or quite a few people who have kidney stones and, or
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=79s)** — a tendency to get osteoporosis. They may have a genetic problem with their gene that they just
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=86s)** — are releasing a lot of calcium in the urine. So typically the scenario of kidney stone,
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=92s)** — you have high oxalates, you have a high calcium, and you also have low citrates. Okay. Citrates.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=101s)** — Now you might think citrus like lemons and limes, things like that. And you're correct,
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=107s)** — but your body also makes citrates. Okay. And the great majority of the time, if you have
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=112s)** — a kidney stone, low citrates are part of the problem because one of the things that citrates do
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=119s)** — is they can act as a chelator with this calcium and bind to the calcium,
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=125s)** — lessening the amount of free calcium to bind with the oxalates. So that's one of the things
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=131s)** — that citrates do. But citrates are involved in industry cleaning agents because it can
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=138s)** — actually get rid of rust off of steel. It's used to help get rid of calcium carbonate.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=144s)** — So it's a chelator. It can bind with another mineral. And you may have taken biology and
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=150s)** — learned about what's called the Krebs cycle, which is this biochemical pathway to help you
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=155s)** — make energy or ATP. Another name for that is called a citric acid cycle. So citrate or citric
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=162s)** — acid is very important in ensuring that you don't get kidney stones. So yes, you can start
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=171s)** — to consume more lemons or limes. And that's what I recommend in the morning when you drink
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=176s)** — your water. And I usually drink a pretty big glass. It's probably, I don't know,
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=181s)** — maybe 20 ounces, something like that. And I'll fill it up with water and I'll put lemon
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=186s)** — juice just because kidney stones do run in my family. And the other thing is just having
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=190s)** — more fluid, right? If you have more fluid, you can dilute the urine because when you get
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=197s)** — a kidney stone, you have what's called a super saturated situation. So too concentrated. But if
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=204s)** — you're drinking at least 2.5 liters of water or other fluids, you can prevent the formation
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=209s)** — of kidney stone. And you can also add the lemon juice in there. I mean, if you have
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=214s)** — kidney stones or developing a stone, I mean, you should be consuming like a lot of lemon juice.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=219s)** — I would say maybe, I don't know, four to six ounces a day. And that can be either from
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=226s)** — actual lemons or lemon juice. But if you're just preventing it, you can just do a little
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=232s)** — bit of lemon, like the lemon juice from one lemon, or you can do like a tablespoon of lemon
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=237s)** — juice. You also want to add the apple cider vinegar in there because from a genetic level,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=243s)** — actually it's an epigenetic action, which is above your genes. And I'm mainly talking about
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=249s)** — the genetic problem with this calcium situation in your urine. You have too much calcium in
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=254s)** — your urine. You can control that and curb that by adding apple cider vinegar. Because what that's
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=261s)** — going to do, it's going to cause the reabsorption, the significant reabsorption of
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=267s)** — citrates. So you won't lose them. You'll keep way more citrates in your urine, preventing
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=275s)** — the formation of the oxalates to the calcium. Now, there is also other things you can do,
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=281s)** — you can add some additional citrates from either potassium citrate or magnesium citrate,
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=288s)** — which can be found in various electrolyte powders, and then drink one or two or even three of
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=294s)** — those a day. And you just may find out you no longer have a kidney stone. Now, apple cider
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=301s)** — vinegar has so many purposes. If you haven't seen my recent apple cider vinegar video and
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Be7ndkw5aQ&t=305s)** — how it can greatly boost your energy, I put that video up right here. Check it out.
