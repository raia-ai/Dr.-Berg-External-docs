- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to talk about the hidden source of anemia, both B12 and iron anemia,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=6s)** — that you probably have never heard before. And this involves a microbe called H. pylori.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=14s)** — And H. pylori is a fascinating bacteria that the majority of the population have already in their
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=21s)** — stomach. And when the timing in the environment is just right, it can come out of remission
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=25s)** — and create all sorts of problems, primarily with gastritis, inflammation of the stomach,
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=32s)** — ulcers, as well as atrophy of your stomach. So the stomach starts shrinking. Out of all the
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=39s)** — places to exist, why would you want to live in an acid stomach? Right? And also it actually
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=44s)** — eats iron, right? That's one of the things it eats. Now, typically what causes this microbe to
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=50s)** — out of remission and create problems is when the stomach pH loses the acidity. Okay? So the more
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=60s)** — alkaline your stomach becomes, the more that that microbe can survive and potentially come
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=64s)** — out of remission. And when the pH becomes more alkaline, as well as in individuals that are
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=71s)** — susceptible, like their immune system is weaker. As a survival mechanism, it also has
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=77s)** — an enzyme called urease, which basically causes the breakdown of urea. And then that turns into
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=84s)** — ammonia. Now this is a survival mechanism because ammonia is that it's extremely alkaline. It has
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=91s)** — a pH of like 11. I mean, think about this. We have the stomach, which has a pH between 1.5 to
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=95s)** — 3, which is like battery acid. So you have a pH of 11 for ammonia. It's super alkaline. And
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=105s)** — there's also another component, molecular mimicry. Okay. What is that? That is another survival
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=111s)** — mechanism where that microbe can mimic your own stomach cells. And so it's trying to go
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=119s)** — underneath the radar. And for the most part, your immune system is tricked by that, but
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=124s)** — not a hundred percent. A lot of times there's an immune reaction. Okay. And then what that
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=129s)** — immune reaction does is it starts attacking your own stomach cells, as well as something
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=134s)** — called the intrinsic factor. And both of those situations lead you to a very severe B12 deficiency.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=143s)** — And then when the stomach atrophies because of this microbe, now you're going to get what's
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=148s)** — called pernicious anemia, which is a B12 condition. In the first phase, when you have
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=152s)** — gastritis, you have a lot of inflammation and you have a lot more acid. And that quickly
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=158s)** — decreases as there's more and more damage to the stomach. And you start having atrophy and
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=163s)** — you lose the function of these little gastric cells. And then the stomach becomes more alkaline.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=169s)** — So you start off being too acid and then it goes over here to alkaline. Okay. And that's
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=175s)** — just a survival mechanism. And when your stomach is not alkaline, now we lose the ability
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=180s)** — to absorb iron. We can't activate iron that's inactive to the active form. We can't absorb
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=186s)** — iron. So now we become iron deficient. So we have both an iron deficiency and the B12
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=192s)** — deficiency. Not a good situation. So here you are taking all this iron, taking all this B12
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=198s)** — and wondering why it's not working. You're trying to fix this thing, but there's something
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=202s)** — else going on completely underneath it. And of course, once you're diagnosed with H.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=207s)** — parlori, the treatment is at least two months of antibiotics. Okay. Usually multiple antibiotics.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=215s)** — And the real unfortunate problem with that is that a lot of people end up with antibiotic
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=221s)** — resistance to this H. pylori microbe. So now the antibiotics won't work anymore.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=228s)** — Okay. Because the microbes quickly counter that mechanism. So here you are two months of therapy.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=234s)** — Right. You have all these side effects of the condition, as well as all the side effects
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=238s)** — from the antibiotic in your gut and other places. This is why the treatment for H. pylori
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=245s)** — with antibiotics is not very successful long-term because they're not looking down the road of
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=251s)** — what's really happening. They're thinking that this microbe is the problem. And so they just need
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=255s)** — to wipe it out and then the problem is solved. When in fact, it's just the tip of the iceberg.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=259s)** — There's a lot more to do with the pH of your stomach, the strength of your immune system,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=263s)** — which now you just weaken because of the antibiotics. Now we still have gastritis.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=268s)** — We might have ulcers and we have atrophy of the stomach. We also now can't protect ourselves
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=274s)** — against microbes that are coming in from our food. So now we have an increased tendency to
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=278s)** — get infections to the body, viruses, bacteria, fungal, you name it. We also can't absorb
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=284s)** — minerals too well. We also can't break down protein too well. So you can see this problem
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=288s)** — goes from bad to worse. What can we do about this? I would recommend taking something that is
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=294s)** — more of a natural antibiotic that is not as potent. You have to take it longer, but there's
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=302s)** — minimal side effects. One of the best things they've researched on this is sulfurophane,
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=309s)** — which is interesting because it's not really a plant. It's a chemical in a plant. It's
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=313s)** — in broccoli sprouts, sauerkraut. It's in the cruciferous vegetables. So sulfurophane is a
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=318s)** — compound, is a potent antimicrobial. And the extra cool thing about this is this,
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=323s)** — it can work against antibiotic resistant microorganisms and infections. So if you have
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=330s)** — this antibiotic resistant microbe, well, sulfurophane can actually still work on that,
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=335s)** — whereas an antibiotic won't work on that. So we're taking a natural remedy, not as potent,
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=342s)** — but we're taking longer to make sure that we do this without the side effects. So that's
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=348s)** — step one. You may also want to add another natural antibiotic called wormwood, okay? Wormwood
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=355s)** — extract. And you don't have to take much. You just take a small amount over a long period
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=359s)** — of time. And I'm talking about three to four months. Now you can get your sulfurophane from a
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=364s)** — supplement, or I would recommend, better yet, get it from microgreens or sprouts, broccoli sprouts
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=371s)** — or broccoli microgreens, right? And have a little bit of that every day in your salad.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=377s)** — That's what I would recommend. The next thing I'm going to recommend as a solution is zinc.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=382s)** — There's many different forms of zinc you can take, but it's more important to just get zinc
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=386s)** — than to focus on what type of form of zinc. But zinc can be very effective against ulcers,
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=394s)** — gastritis, as well as healing the stomach and helping you build up your hydrochloric acid.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=399s)** — And so once the gastritis has settled down and the ulcer is healed, then we want to
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=404s)** — add betaine hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar to your stomach, but not until
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=408s)** — the ulcer is gone and the inflammation is gone. The other thing that you want to do that
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=414s)** — can greatly help put things back in the balance is to either take a really good probiotic,
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=421s)** — or better yet, start consuming a little sauerkraut or even some pickles. There are
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=426s)** — certain microbes in sauerkraut and pickles that are very beneficial to help counter
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=432s)** — this H. pylori. Because remember, we have the good bacteria and the bad bacteria, right?
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=436s)** — So we want to increase the good from this probiotic or the sauerkraut and help counter
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=440s)** — the situation. And plus sauerkraut also has sulfurophane and it's really good for the digestion
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=447s)** — if someone has gastritis or for that matter, any digestive issues. All right, so now that you know
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=453s)** — this other source of anemia, which is very valuable if you have anemia, it's probably
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YyMY7_T094&t=458s)** — important to show you the other causes of anemia. Okay, and I put that up right here. Check
