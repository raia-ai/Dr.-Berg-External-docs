- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to talk about a crazy epidemic of autoimmune diseases.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=6s)** — One out of every 12 people will develop an autoimmune disease.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=9s)** — One out of nine adult women will develop an autoimmune disease.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=13s)** — It is way more common. In heart disease, with cancer, it's one out of 14.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=18s)** — So since the 50s and 60s, we have a 3x spike in autoimmune diseases.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=24s)** — In this graph right here, you can see Crohn's disease going straight up.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=27s)** — You see MS and type 1 diabetes.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=31s)** — So normally, the immune system has a very complex and difficult job
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=36s)** — creating tolerance for our own cells.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=39s)** — In other words, it has to differentiate our own cells and our own friendly microbes
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=45s)** — and differentiate that from external pathogens, viruses, microbes, etc.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=52s)** — And the hallmark of an autoimmune disease is really inflammation.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=55s)** — So we have this inflammatory reaction because the immune system is attacking it.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=60s)** — But I want to explain the single common denominator with all autoimmune diseases
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=66s)** — is this intestinal permeability, leaky gut.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=70s)** — The small intestine, where 90% of all the digestion occurs
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=73s)** — and you have a little mucus layer, you have these little villi,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=77s)** — and you have this single cell layer between the internal part of the intestine.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=81s)** — Food particles are supposed to be absorbed through that in a certain way.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=84s)** — But when there's holes, because there's leaky gut, we lose that immigration, that stamp of approval.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=91s)** — We allow things through that area.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=94s)** — And now we have a massive confusion.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=96s)** — We have things that are incorrectly tagged as harmful.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=99s)** — And then we have a cascade of effect that can then lead to problems of any tissue in your body.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=106s)** — There are several companies that provide this online test.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=109s)** — It's not too expensive. You can get them.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=111s)** — I'll put a list of several down below and find out if you have leaky gut.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=116s)** — And then what you can do is make some changes and then redo the test,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=120s)** — you know, maybe every month or every couple months to see how it's improving.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=124s)** — What creates damage in your intestine?
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=127s)** — There's been a paper, 2005.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=130s)** — They found 287 industrial chemicals in the fetal cord blood of 10 newborn infants.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=139s)** — We're talking about chemicals from plastics, pesticides, chemicals that are flame retardants.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=146s)** — I mean, this is bizarre.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=148s)** — But then we have gluten.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=150s)** — Okay, gluten can trigger Hashimoto's and Celiac.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=154s)** — It's the only proteins that we cannot, as humans, digest.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=158s)** — So as you know, most of the wheat in America, at least, is sprayed with glyphosate,
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=163s)** — which Monsanto sold round up to Bayer,
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=167s)** — who now has a big problem because they have over a hundred thousand lawsuits against them.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=172s)** — But unfortunately, our food system, corn, soy, cottonseed, canola,
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=177s)** — have been heavily doused with this Roundup Ready, which has been patented as an antibiotic.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=184s)** — Glyphosate has been known to cause leaky gut as well.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=187s)** — Being an antibiotic, it destroys the microbiome,
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=191s)** — which is going to create more inflammation in your gut.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=194s)** — On top of that, it interrupts certain enzymes, especially in your liver,
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=199s)** — the phase one, phase two detoxification enzymes.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=202s)** — And so then you're getting these chemicals, but then you can't get rid of the chemicals.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=205s)** — Once you get the inflammation in the gut, you can't absorb vitamin D that well anymore, too.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=211s)** — So vitamin D is the most important vitamin for your immune system.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=217s)** — It helps prevent autoimmune diseases.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=220s)** — It's a powerful anti-inflammatory.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=223s)** — It's almost impossible to develop an autoimmune disease
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=227s)** — unless you also have some degree of a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=233s)** — And then you have also the seed oils that are from grains as well, right?
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=237s)** — Soy, oil, canola, cottonseed, corn, etc.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=242s)** — If you take a look at the graphs of seed oils,
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=246s)** — I mean, it's like one of the common things that parallels,
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=249s)** — it goes straight up since the late 50s, 60s, 70s.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=253s)** — I mean, people are just consuming so many seed oils.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=256s)** — And then we just have ultra-processed food ingredients.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=259s)** — That would be a combination of seed oils, refined sugars, refined starches.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=264s)** — I mean, 83% of all calories in the grocery store are ultra-processed foods.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=268s)** — Those ingredients create inflammatory states in your gut.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=272s)** — And the next one to list are certain medications.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=274s)** — PPIs, for example, which people take for GERD or heartburn, things like that.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=278s)** — Well, there's something called drug-induced lupus, okay, from PPIs.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=284s)** — This next thing I'm going to talk about is the icing on the cake.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=288s)** — And that is a stress-induced autoimmune disease.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=294s)** — In practice, I actually personally interacted with about 40,000 patients
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=299s)** — over the course of 30 years.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=302s)** — And when someone would come in with an autoimmune disease,
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=304s)** — and I would do a history,
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=305s)** — there is always some stress event that occurred right before they developed the autoimmune disease.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=312s)** — Stress activates cortisol.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=314s)** — Cortisol paralyzes your immune system.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=317s)** — So, this is the solution.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=319s)** — Number one, you're going to have to avoid the seed oils.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=321s)** — And you're going to have to start eating really clean, grass-fed, things like that.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=325s)** — I'm going to highly recommend you get on the ketogenic diet
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=327s)** — with high-quality animal proteins, as well as a good amount of fat.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=332s)** — When I switched my diet off these grains to more beef, red meat, things like that,
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=338s)** — I remember my gut was feeling so good.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=342s)** — I had normal bowel movements.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=344s)** — I mean, it was bizarre because I thought you needed all this, like,
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=348s)** — grain fiber brand to help you go to the bathroom.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=352s)** — Well, that constipated me.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=354s)** — And like I said, whatever they are telling you to do, go in the opposite direction.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=358s)** — With this healthy version of keto, should you consume vegetables or not,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=363s)** — I recommend that you don't consume raw vegetables.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=367s)** — I recommend you cook every vegetable that you consume
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=370s)** — because the raw vegetables, the fibers, can also activate certain problems
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=374s)** — because you have leaky gut.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=376s)** — As far as fermented vegetables like sauerkraut, kimchi, maybe some pickles,
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=381s)** — have a moderate to a smaller amount of that.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=385s)** — If your gut inflammation is really bad,
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=389s)** — then I would go complete carnivore for at least a couple of months.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=392s)** — But I think if you could tolerate at least some cooked vegetables
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=397s)** — and the fermented vegetables, that can help with the increase in the microbiome.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=404s)** — As far as vitamin D goes, yes, you need vitamin D a lot.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=407s)** — I would recommend anywhere between 30 to 50,000 IUs per day for a period of time.
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=412s)** — L-glutamine might be a beneficial supplement to help heal the gut.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=418s)** — You're going to be getting this glutamine from red meat
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=421s)** — or any type of animal protein that you consume.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=425s)** — There's one more remedy that you may want to try, and that's called colostrum.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=428s)** — When you start taking colostrum, take very, very small amounts
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=432s)** — because yes, it does have some milk proteins that you might be allergic to.
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=438s)** — But the only reason I'm even bringing this up is because colostrum
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=441s)** — has a really powerful immune function.
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=443s)** — But those are the changes that I would recommend to help turn this thing around.
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=448s)** — Since we're on the topic of inflammation, you should probably see this video
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=452s)** — where I talk about the number one food that can help you heal and regenerate.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F5ylBMx71Q&t=458s)** — And it's right here. Check it out.
