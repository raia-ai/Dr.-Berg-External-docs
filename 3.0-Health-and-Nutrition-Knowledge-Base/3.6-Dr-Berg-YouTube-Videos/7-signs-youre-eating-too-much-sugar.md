- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=0s)** — There are seven very surprising signs that you're eating too much sugar.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=6s)** — I think most people know the classic signs of eating too much sugar, which is fatigue, brain fog, belly fat, cravings for carbs, cavities.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=15s)** — But I need to clarify exactly what sugar is and the difference between a sugar and a carbohydrate.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=20s)** — Because there's a lot of confusion in the area of like complex carbohydrates or simple carbohydrates or simple sugars.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=27s)** — It's a big blur for a lot of people. A carbohydrate consists of three things. Sugar, fiber, and starch.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=36s)** — But starch is the hidden sugar that no one's talking about.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=40s)** — Now, of course you have like starch in vegetables, but then you also have starch in this stuff right here, right? Or this stuff right here.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=47s)** — So what actually is starch? Starch is sugar, okay? It's just a bunch of sugar connected together.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=54s)** — And so the word that the user described it is poly, which means many saccharides, which means sugar.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=62s)** — So when you're eating starch, you're actually eating sugar, okay?
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=64s)** — And when we talk about starch in the grocery store, we're talking about this stuff right here.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=69s)** — Powdered starch, we're not talking about potatoes or vegetables.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=73s)** — We're talking about ultra processed food, calorie starch.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=78s)** — And this starch will spike your blood sugars way, way, way higher than actual sugar will.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=85s)** — On the glycemic index, you have table sugar, which is 65. You have glucose, which is 100.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=92s)** — But there are starches like maltodextrin, which can go up to about 185.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=98s)** — That's like a massively high spike. And it's not just maltodextrin.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=101s)** — It's like modified food starch and modified corn starch.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=104s)** — And it's pretty well because you can make starch from corn.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=107s)** — You can make seed oils from corn.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=111s)** — And you could make sugar like in glucose syrup or corn syrup from corn.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=117s)** — You can buy one metric ton of corn for $198.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=123s)** — Now from that investment, how many boxes of corn flakes could you make?
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=128s)** — Corn flakes are mostly made out of corn.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=131s)** — And you can buy those from Walmart for about $4 a box.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=135s)** — So $200 of corn will turn into 3636 boxes of corn flakes, giving you profits of $14,500.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=149s)** — That's a 7,150% profit margin.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=154s)** — Now what other investment can you get over 7,000% profit from a raw material to a finished product?
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=162s)** — Can you do with meat? No. Meat has like a 30% margin.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=167s)** — So somehow corn flakes and Cheerios and even vegetable oils are not attacked for being unhealthy.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=175s)** — They're heart healthy. But meat, for example, is vilified. That'll cause cancer.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=180s)** — But anyway, I digressed from the topic, but I think it's important to know that the biggest reason for ultra processed food, aka junk food, is massive profitability.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=193s)** — All right, so now let's dive into the seven surprising signs that you're eating too much sugar.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=197s)** — Number seven is reduced collagen. When you consume too much sugar, you're going to produce less collagen.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=205s)** — And that's going to show up in loose skin, more wrinkled skin. People that eat more sugar are going to age prematurely.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=213s)** — Number six, a chronic white tongue. So you have a white tongue that just doesn't seem to go away.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=219s)** — That is a form of candida because you're eating too much sugar. You're feeding this fungus and it's continuing to grow.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=226s)** — I do not think you can get rid of this candida without eliminating sugar from the diet because it loves these simple sugars.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=232s)** — And number five, we get into chronic sinus problems. Most chronic sinus problems are a fungus called aspergillus.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=240s)** — It's the usual type and that microbe actually feeds off of sugar too.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=246s)** — So again, I don't think you're going to be able to get rid of a chronic sinus infection unless you completely get rid of sugar because it keeps living off the sugar that you consume.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=256s)** — Alright, number four, red or pink gums. You brush your teeth and you see a little pink in the toothbrush.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=264s)** — That is a very mild version of scurvy where you're having a vitamin C deficiency.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=267s)** — So when you eat sugar, you block vitamin C and one place that it shows up is in your gums.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=274s)** — Alright, number three is low testosterone. That's right. Sugar will lower testosterone.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=280s)** — That can lead to erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and also difficulty building muscle as well because testosterone is involved in that.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=290s)** — Number two, susceptibility to infection. That's right. Having too much sugar will weaken your immune system to the point where you're more vulnerable to acquire an infection.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=300s)** — And the number one sign that you're eating too much sugar, and this is actually very surprising, high levels of adrenaline.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=306s)** — Too much sugar damages the cell's ability to make energy in the mitochondria.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=312s)** — And so the way that the body compensates for that is by increasing adrenaline, not just for energy, but to help mobilize glucose and to make new glucose for fuel.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=323s)** — That's called gluconeogenesis. High adrenaline doesn't come from mental stress.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=327s)** — It comes from physical stress or stress that happens in your cells because you're not able to make enough energy.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=335s)** — And so this is why you might notice when you're fatigued that you have a lot of nervous energy, restlessness.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=342s)** — That's the big symptom of a mitochondrial damage and a low vitamin B1 because the motor is broken.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=350s)** — And vitamin B1 is a spark plug to help activate it. And the more sugar or starch, the more requirement for B1, and then it kind of puts out the flame.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=361s)** — So now you get this nervous energy or this lactic acid buildup.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=366s)** — So this leads to insomnia, restless leg syndrome.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=370s)** — And also the adrenaline is going to affect your digestion and also increase clotting in the body's heart attack and stroke.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=378s)** — Now, since I did mention alter process food calories, if you have not seen this video on maltodextrin, you should check it out.
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zXbFp3djA&t=386s)** — I put it up right here.
