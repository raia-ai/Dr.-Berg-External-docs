- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=0s)** — Can eating sugar be part of a balanced healthy diet if consumed in moderation?
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=5s)** — I mean, come on. They actually help make healthy foods palatable.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=9s)** — Dr. David Katz says that it's a preferred fuel for your brain.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=14s)** — And he also mentioned that what's the point of being healthy if you can't really enjoy yourself?
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=19s)** — And if we go to the Sugar Association and you read on their page regarding
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=23s)** — cardiovascular disease, it says this, nutritional patterns may play a role in several
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=29s)** — of these risk factors. However, scientists have heavily debated and not fully settled
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=34s)** — whether there's evidence for a specific role of carbohydrates or sugar in cardiovascular disease.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=41s)** — So this is a really common tactic that the tobacco companies use.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=46s)** — All you have to do is put doubt in people's minds. Definitely doubt in the scientific
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=50s)** — research. I mean, we know that the American Heart Association gets major funding from
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=57s)** — We know that the Major Dietetic Association, the group that organizes events for dieticians,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=64s)** — get major funding to the magnitude of like $23 million.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=69s)** — So I have a question. On average, how much sugar do you think a person really consumes?
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=76s)** — It's 23 teaspoons of sugar. 23 teaspoons of sugar is roughly around a half of a cup
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=82s)** — of sugar every single day. That's a lot. But is that really all the sugar? Well, there's
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=88s)** — hidden sugars that I want to make you aware of that a lot of people don't talk about.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=92s)** — And what do I mean hidden sugars? Well, this food right here, this has zero sugars. This
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=98s)** — one has zero sugars. This one has zero sugars. Zero sugars. What about goldfish? Zero sugars.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=104s)** — So that's interesting because that is a good comparison of junk food,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=108s)** — ultra processed food calories. But there's really no sugar in those foods. So why are those so
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=114s)** — bad? If you take the total carbohydrates and you minus the sugars and you minus the fiber,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=120s)** — you're left with what? A starch. That's the stuff right here. And on the glycemic index,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=126s)** — this stuff is way, way higher than actual sugar. And when you're talking about starch
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=130s)** — in these products, you're not talking about like a potato or rice or anything like that.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=134s)** — You're talking about multidextrin or modified food starch or modified cornstarch. So in other
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=139s)** — words, starch has a bigger effect on your blood sugars than actual sugar. If we take a look at
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=147s)** — the average person's consumption of starch, take a wild guess how much sugar that really is.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=154s)** — If you guess 75 teaspoons, you are correct. That is roughly about a cup and a half of
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=160s)** — every single day from the hidden sugars from starches. Now let me just give you another
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=165s)** — example. I used to consume a much bigger bag of Doritos going through college and this right
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=170s)** — here has 11 serving sizes. I'll guarantee no one is going to consume one 11th of this bag.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=179s)** — Cheez-Its, zero sugar. But if you look at the hidden sugar of starches, it's about 30
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=184s)** — teaspoons of sugar. Pringles, this has like 60 teaspoons of hidden sugar as starch.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=190s)** — About a cup and a half. Okay, so there's a lot of sugar in a lot of different foods,
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=193s)** — but what's so bad about this sugar? I mean, sugar is natural, right? Well,
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=197s)** — at least this sugar is natural. Well, it might be from nature or it might be synthetic,
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=202s)** — but there's a big difference between actual sugar in the refined form and the sugar
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=208s)** — in a banana or fruit or other foods. What is the difference? Well, with refined sugar,
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=214s)** — this is not just empty calories. This is something without nutrients, without antioxidants.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=221s)** — It's very, very different than actual fruit. And what people do not realize is that when you
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=227s)** — try to consume that and use that as fuel, it requires a tremendous amount of nutrition.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=233s)** — I'm talking about magnesium, calcium, zinc, B vitamins. And this is really unknown to a lot
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=239s)** — of people because the biochemistry of your body in your little factories called the mitochondria
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=244s)** — need nutrients to process that type of fuel. And so if you're chronically consuming that type
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=249s)** — of fuel, there's only one choice. And that is to deplete your reserves to the point where you
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=254s)** — don't have any nutrients anymore. Now there's the backup engine that's outside the mitochondria,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=260s)** — but the problem with that is it doesn't produce a lot of energy. It only produces like two
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=266s)** — units of energy called ATP versus in the mitochondria, you produce like 36 to 38
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=273s)** — units of energy or ATP. So now you're running on an old clunky motor and everything starts
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=279s)** — going downhill because now you don't also have the antioxidants to protect you against
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=283s)** — all the damage that has occurred in your cells. So this is why we develop chronic diabetes,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=291s)** — Alzheimer's, inflammation, skin problems. So we've known this for a very long time. And this
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=296s)** — is why if you look on the ingredients in some of these foods, you'll see that they're all
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=302s)** — fortified with nutrients because they know if you're deficient and even one nutrient, you can
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=307s)** — get a major disease. I mean, just to make a point about that, if you completely block one
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=313s)** — nutrient, vitamin B3, you will die. What the food manufacturing companies have done is
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=319s)** — enriched or sprayed a couple of synthetic vitamins. And you might think that might be
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=324s)** — enough, but it's not even close. Spraying like seven synthetic vitamins from petroleum
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=329s)** — is not the same as consuming whole foods. Okay, you're not going to get the same nutrition
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=333s)** — from these junk foods. So this is what I recommend that you do. Okay, number one,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=339s)** — stop eating sugar, but you might not have considered also eliminating starches. And
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=345s)** — I'm not concerned with you eliminating all the starches from vegetables. I'm talking about
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=349s)** — the starches from this stuff right here. Because if you did that, what's going to happen
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=354s)** — is you're going to start to reverse this whole disease cycle. You're going to start to
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=359s)** — lower the blood sugars. You're going to start to get rid of a fatty liver. You're going to
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=369s)** — much better fuel for the heart than glucose. And all of a sudden your body organs start
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=374s)** — working better and better and better. And your cravings go away and your mood is elevated.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=379s)** — Now, if you haven't seen my other video on sugar that had over 17 million views,
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1PQy1DeHEk&t=384s)** — I put it up right here. Check it out.
