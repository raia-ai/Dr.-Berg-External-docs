- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=0s)** — I'd like to discuss a very, very important hormone called growth hormone in relationship to how to increase it,
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=7s)** — especially as you age. Unfortunately, as we age, growth hormone just really tanks.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=13s)** — If you're over 65 years old, your growth hormone is likely to be 65% lower than what it should be.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=21s)** — And growth hormone in an adult versus a child works completely differently.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=26s)** — So if you don't have enough growth hormone as a kid, you're going to be shorter.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=29s)** — But in an adult, it has everything to do with protein synthesis. I'm talking about muscle building,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=38s)** — building of your tendons, your ligaments, your collagen, your joints, and your bones.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=45s)** — Now, what's pretty wild about this is that the levels of growth hormone in someone over the
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=51s)** — age of 60 are equivalent to someone younger with a growth hormone deficiency pathology
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=57s)** — or some dysfunction with the pituitary gland. Because the pituitary gland makes growth hormone.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=63s)** — So a lot of people are deficient in growth hormone and they don't connect the dots on
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=68s)** — what that's doing to their body. They're going to have a difficult time building muscle.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=72s)** — A growth hormone also has everything to do with fat burning. They're breaking down the lipids or
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=77s)** — fats, primarily in your midsection. So someone with lower growth hormone is going to have a
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=87s)** — usually have a lower mood relating to either depression or anxiety. They may have higher
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=93s)** — levels of LDL, hair loss, and insomnia. But growth hormone, in typical in adult,
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=99s)** — helps you with protein. Very similar to testosterone. So not only does growth hormone
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=106s)** — go down as you age, testosterone also goes down as well. So growth hormone is produced
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=112s)** — by the pituitary gland that's in your brain. And that hormone signal comes down and works
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=118s)** — through your liver initially. And it works with this other thing. It's like a hormone. It's
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=123s)** — called insulin-like growth factor number one. Now it sounds kind of a strange name, but
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=128s)** — basically you can think of that very similar to growth hormone because it has very similar
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=133s)** — functions except for growth hormone has a more potent effect on fat burning. Whereas IGF1 or
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=140s)** — IGF1 has a weaker effect on fat burning. Now there's a very important reason why I brought
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=145s)** — that up because I'm going to be talking about the liver in just a minute. But I just wanted to
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=148s)** — give you the general function of what growth hormone does. Professional athletes that take
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=153s)** — human growth hormone when probably they're not supposed to because it's illegal in many
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=158s)** — different sports. And it does have a lot of side effects. But that doesn't seem to discourage
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=163s)** — certain athletes from taking it. And there's a lot of people taking other types of things to
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=169s)** — stimulate growth hormone. I'm going to focus more on the natural ways that will keep you
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=174s)** — out of trouble that don't have side effects. What blocks growth hormone? The biggest thing is
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=180s)** — insomnia, especially if you have sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a situation where you're you
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=185s)** — have this obstruction in your back of your your sinus cavity or maybe the back of the
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=191s)** — throat for some reason and you're not able to get enough oxygen. There's some interesting
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=195s)** — connection between getting enough oxygen when you're sleeping, right, in order to sleep. So
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=200s)** — if we have this imbalance and we're not getting enough air, we're not going to be able to get
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=203s)** — enough sleep. Growth hormone is mostly elevated during the first part of deep delta wave
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=210s)** — sleep. So if you don't get that, you're not going to be able to have the benefit of growth
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=216s)** — hormone. In fact, they tested people with sleep apnea and their growth hormone is much,
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=221s)** — lower. And even when they wear a CPAP machine and they get more oxygen, okay, that's that mask over
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=228s)** — their their nose where they're in their mouth where they're getting oxygen, their growth
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=232s)** — hormone comes back to where it should be, which is interesting. So if you can fix sleep
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=237s)** — apnea, you can greatly increase growth hormone. When you're in a room, when the windows are not
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=243s)** — open and you're not getting enough oxygen, because maybe you don't also have enough plants
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=248s)** — in your room which give you oxygen, you may have a tendency to have more CO2 in that room.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=254s)** — And just that alone can affect your sleep in a negative way. And this is why when you open
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=261s)** — the window, if you can, or you get a plant next to where you're sleeping, you can definitely
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=267s)** — sleep better. Just for the fact that you're increasing the oxygen and you're lowering the
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=270s)** — CO2. So many people are spending all day in a room with a higher level of CO2 and not
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=277s)** — oxygen. So this greatly higher CO2 situation can affect cognitive function, especially if you're
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=285s)** — like a student and you're taking a test and you're trying to have the best intelligent
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=289s)** — focus that you can. Well, having this imbalance of CO2 and oxygen can greatly affect that,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=294s)** — but it also majorly affects your sleep. The next thing that really messes up growth hormone
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=298s)** — is something called hyperglycemia. That's too much sugar in the blood from a high
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=303s)** — carbohydrate diet. Or let's say you're a diabetic. That can inhibit growth hormone. And there's a lot
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=309s)** — of things that you can do to fix that, like going on a low carb diet. But what you need to
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=313s)** — know is that one common way that growth hormone is suppressed is through either high sugar
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=320s)** — or high insulin. Now this insulin topic is very interesting because high level of insulin
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=328s)** — will suppress growth hormone the same as a severe deficiency of insulin. So we really need to have
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=338s)** — normal insulin. And this is maybe a confusion that a lot of people have with keto. They
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=343s)** — think that they need to bring insulin down to zero because insulin is really, really bad.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=348s)** — No, insulin is really necessary. It's a normal hormone. We want it normal. We don't want
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=353s)** — it too high or too low. And unless you're a type 1 diabetic and have loss of the cells that produce
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=360s)** — insulin, usually when you are a diabetic or a pre-diabetic, not type 1 but type 2, you can
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=367s)** — have a situation where you have high level of insulin and low level of insulin at this
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=373s)** — exact same time. Now how can that be? Well, because the body develops this resistance. So in
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=378s)** — receptor, you have this blockage. So the insulin comes out triggered by carbs, goes into the
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=384s)** — receptor. The receptor is blocking it. So we have low insulin inside the cell. The feedback loop
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=389s)** — actually tells the pancreas to produce more. So now we have the situation where we have more
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=393s)** — and more and more insulin. And over time, the insulin becomes so weak that you can't regulate
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=400s)** — the blood sugars anymore because the pancreas is exhausted. So one really simple way to know
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=406s)** — if you have a severe insulin deficiency is this. You want to do a test, a fasting blood glucose
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=415s)** — test. You don't even have to go to the doctor. You can just get a kit at the local drug store
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=420s)** — or buy it online. But it's a blood test kit and you test while you're fasting. Maybe like
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=426s)** — when you wake up in the morning. Normally it should be around 75-80. If that blood sugar is
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=432s)** — let's say it goes up to 100, 115, 120, things like that, then you know you have a deficiency
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=442s)** — of insulin. Think about it. What's happening when your blood sugars are going up? You don't
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=446s)** — have enough insulin to suppress the blood sugars because that's what insulin does.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=451s)** — Anytime your blood sugar goes up, you don't have enough insulin. And that could be created
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=455s)** — from this insulin resistant situation. And one really interesting thing about a diabetic
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=461s)** — on a good portion of their high blood sugar. It may not be 100% from the diet. In fact, it's not.
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=469s)** — A good portion of their high sugar is because the liver is making too much glucose. It's
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=476s)** — making out of protein and even fat and even ketones. So that brings up the next point that
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=482s)** — I want to talk about. The pituitary gland as one of its functions is the production of
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=488s)** — hormone. And if you think about these hormones, they're made by glands. Hormones are
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=493s)** — communications that travel between different points, right? From the pituitary to the liver.
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=498s)** — And then also there's a feedback loop that comes back to turn it off. So you have this
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=502s)** — entire communication going on. And my thought is not to replace the message or the hormone
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=510s)** — with some synthetic version. Instead, why don't we actually support the gland that actually
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=515s)** — makes growth hormone? It's a new concept for a lot of people, but it's much, much wiser because
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=521s)** — that way you don't mess with this hormone that can then shut down the gland. So anytime you
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=527s)** — take any type of hormone replacement, whether it's estrogen or even testosterone or even
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=532s)** — growth hormone, you end up causing the gland that makes it to go to sleep. It atrophies,
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=538s)** — it shrinks, it doesn't work anymore. So one really important thing I think would be good to
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=545s)** — increase your growth hormone, especially if you notice a loss of muscle and these other issues
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=551s)** — I mentioned, is to take a pituitary glandular support. One that I like and I'm not affiliated
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=557s)** — with this company. I don't get any kickbacks or anything, but it's standard process.
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=561s)** — They're a pituitrophin product. PMG. This is something I used in practice. It seems to
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=567s)** — work good not by giving you growth hormone because they take the hormones out, but by
- **[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=572s)** — giving you the raw materials to support the gland that makes your own growth hormone.
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=580s)** — And a lot of people have reported back that they sleep better and their nails and hair starts
- **[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=586s)** — growing back much better. So you might want to make a mental note of that. Also stress. A
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=591s)** — little bit of stress is good for the growth hormone, but chronic stress, right? It can
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=596s)** — really inhibit your growth hormone. But intermittent stress is good as an exercise,
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=602s)** — intense exercise has the ability to stimulate growth hormone up to 2000%.
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=608s)** — And I'm talking about sprinting as the most intense can help someone increase growth hormone.
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=614s)** — If you have a liver problem, as in a fatty liver or an inflamed liver or even a liver
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=620s)** — that has cirrhosis, that can really mess with your growth hormone. So anything that
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=626s)** — can improve liver function will help growth hormone. And I'm talking about milk thistle.
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=631s)** — That's probably one of the best things you can take to improve many different aspects of your
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=636s)** — liver. I mean, it's kind of like something that actually counters poisoning in your liver,
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=641s)** — whether it's from Tylenol poisoning or a snake bite or poisoning from mushroom.
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=647s)** — Milk thistle counters that, but it has a lot of other cool things it can do as well.
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=652s)** — And from a diet standpoint, moderate protein can help increase growth hormone.
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=657s)** — That sounds familiar. Sounds like the ketogenic diet, right? Now what type of protein is best?
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=663s)** — The most bioavailable complete protein. The protein that has basically the best
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=667s)** — concentrated amino acids. Red meat, eggs, fish, all of that is really, really good.
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=673s)** — And also red meat and other types of meat are loaded with zinc. And if you're zinc
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=678s)** — deficient, you're also going to be low in growth hormone as well as testosterone.
- **[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=683s)** — So you want to make sure you do the healthy version of the ketogenic diet, which includes
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=689s)** — all of these nutrients, like all the trace minerals to help. Now when you exercise,
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=693s)** — okay, I've talked a lot about doing the cold immersion or even a cold shower to help increase
- **[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=699s)** — anti-aging factors and things like that. But cold therapy also increases something called
- **[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=705s)** — heat shock proteins, which increase growth hormone. Heat, as in a hot shower or a sauna or a whirlpool
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=715s)** — or a jacuzzi will also increase growth hormone significantly, even more than cold therapy.
- **[12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=724s)** — Okay. So heat therapy will increase growth hormone by a factor of 1500%, which is even
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=733s)** — exercise. So this is why I'm bringing this up because maybe you can combine it. And also this
- **[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=738s)** — heat will help you sleep at night, which will automatically increase your growth hormone. But
- **[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=744s)** — I'm not talking about when you're in the bed staying warm. I'm talking about sometime during
- **[12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=747s)** — the day getting a sauna because at night you want to keep the room a bit cooler. You're going
- **[12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=752s)** — to sleep better. And maybe you just sleep with a sheet or something like that. And the
- **[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=756s)** — other aspect of growth hormone is to do intermittent fasting. It's actually very, very
- **[12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=761s)** — potent. I'm not talking about necessarily lowering your calories, especially if you're trying to
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=767s)** — build muscle. I'm recommending to keep the same amount of calories, but just eat them less
- **[12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=772s)** — frequently. So if you did two meals and you did enough calories and you didn't snack,
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=778s)** — you have the ability to increase growth hormone by 2000%, which is pretty fascinating. I want
- **[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=786s)** — to just bring up the topic of your muscles. Okay. Sometimes people, when they get on the
- **[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=790s)** — ketogenic diet, they feel that the muscles are just flat. They kind of lost their size. They
- **[13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=795s)** — look dehydrated because when you do keto, at least initially you lose your glycogen stores.
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=803s)** — Glycogen is basically the storage of glucose, a lot of water and potassium. And when you
- **[13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=811s)** — initially cut down your carbs, okay, you're going to also use up some of your glycogen
- **[13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=817s)** — reserve and you're going to lose water weight. Okay. And then your body's going to burn more
- **[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=822s)** — fat. You're going to get leaner. But how do we handle this flat muscle situation? Well,
- **[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=827s)** — here's how you would handle it. There's a real interesting study with athletes that do
- **[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=832s)** — keto. And apparently there's no glycogen difference in their muscles versus someone
- **[13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=836s)** — who's not doing keto. They have the same amount of glycogen. Now think about what
- **[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=840s)** — happens with an athlete. They have to use this glycogen initially to run a certain way.
- **[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=845s)** — And then if they're fat adapted, they can convert over to burning fat and they burn three times
- **[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=849s)** — as much fat as anyone else. They're like a fat burning machine. But what if you're not an
- **[14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=854s)** — athlete, okay, and you're not using up this glycogen that then caused your body to replenish
- **[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=860s)** — it, you might have lower amounts of glycogen. Well, number one, make sure you consume enough
- **[14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=866s)** — fluid with the electrolyte potassium and sodium. Very, very, very important to keep the
- **[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=874s)** — dehydration of the muscle because we want to avoid this carb loading. Bodybuilders do where
- **[14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=880s)** — they basically just eat a lot of refined carbs and they just fill up the muscle with glycogen,
- **[14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=885s)** — which is a lot of its water. So it makes the muscle look fuller. We don't want to do
- **[14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=890s)** — that because that comes with the package. It creates problems with insulin resistance, but at
- **[14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=893s)** — the same time, we don't want to look dehydrated. So we want to make sure that
- **[14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=896s)** — the electrolytes, including sodium and potassium, are consumed with enough fluid. And
- **[15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=904s)** — if you have a problem with this, you need to bring your carbs up to 50 grams. So that would
- **[15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=909s)** — be roughly about three cups of berries per day. But we don't want to just do any straight sugar
- **[15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=915s)** — because that's going to inhibit our growth hormone. So I've given you a lot of different
- **[15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=918s)** — things you can do related to growth hormone. And there's a lot more to learn about this,
- **[15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=922s)** — but if you have not seen this video on how to help someone with sleep apnea,
- **[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicLOEhw3nA&t=928s)** — that would be a really good one to watch. I put it up right here.
