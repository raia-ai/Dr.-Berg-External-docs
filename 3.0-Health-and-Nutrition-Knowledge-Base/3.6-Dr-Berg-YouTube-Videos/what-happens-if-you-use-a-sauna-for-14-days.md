- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=0s)** — So what would actually happen to your body if you actually gave up sugar for two short weeks?
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=5s)** — And I know a lot of people will tell you that the trend for eating sugar is a lot less than it was
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=10s)** — before. And so how can that account for all of our health problems? Well, you're about to find
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=16s)** — out. Let's first dive into the benefits of what would happen after just two weeks of not eating
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=22s)** — sugar. The first thing you would notice is your face would be less round, okay? Less puffy.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=28s)** — I used to have kind of a puffy roundish face. Now it's not a full-blown moon face but it was
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=34s)** — definitely rounder and it wasn't as thin as it is now. So the shape of your face will change
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=39s)** — because you're going to have less fat in your face. Number two, you're going to notice less
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=43s)** — puffy eyelids. You can always identify how much sugar someone's consuming by looking at how
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=49s)** — puffy their eyelids are. In fact, I had puffy eyelids for many years. I didn't know what it
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=54s)** — was. But after I get rid of the sugar, that puffiness went away. Number three, your midsection,
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=60s)** — your belly fat, will reduce. Too much sugar converts to excess liver fat which then spills
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=66s)** — over into your gut, the fat around the organs giving you belly fat. So belly fat is a really
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=71s)** — good indication that you're eating too many carbs. Number four, your cravings for carbs
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=76s)** — will go down to zero. You just will not want carbs anymore. But even a little bit of sugar
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=81s)** — here and there will keep that craving persisting to the point where it's going to be really
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=84s)** — hard to give it up. This next one, number five, your hunger is going to go way down. You're not
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=88s)** — going to be hungry all the time. You're going to feel satisfied which is going to be huge if
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=93s)** — you want to stick to any type of plan. It's torturous to crave things and be hungry all
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=97s)** — the time when you're trying to lose weight. So sugar increases insulin and insulin makes you
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=102s)** — hungry. The next one is your mood is going to greatly improve. If you were depressed before,
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=106s)** — if you had anxiety before, you're probably going to be a lot calmer. You're going to feel
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=111s)** — I remember getting a success story from this gentleman who was very very depressed to the
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=115s)** — point of suicide. In fact he wanted to kill himself. So he locked himself in his room and
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=119s)** — he stopped eating everything. So he was doing a fast and of course when you're fasting you're
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=125s)** — not eating any sugar and your body's in the ketosis. And so by the third day he felt
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=133s)** — wonderful. His depression went away. And so intermittent fasting or fasting and lowering
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=138s)** — your carbs create a similar effect. I remember when I was on a high carb diet,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=147s)** — boy did I have brain fog. I had no idea that it was coming from all the sugar. I didn't make
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=152s)** — the connection until one day I decided to give up the sugar and it was like someone took this
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=158s)** — brain fog helmet off my head and I finally actually can think. I used to have it. I can
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=168s)** — press my finger into my ankles and it would leave a dent. That's pitting edema. I had that. I had
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=174s)** — no idea that was all the sugar that I was consuming. Sugar retains fluid. And this relates
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=180s)** — to the next point as well. Your eyes are going to improve. Your kidneys will improve. Your
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=184s)** — arteries will improve and your nerves will get better because those are the four tissues
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=189s)** — that higher amounts of sugar will affect. And when it comes down to the eye you can gain
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=195s)** — more fluid into the eye increasing your risk for glaucoma when you have high amounts of sugar
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=201s)** — in your blood because think about this. If you have this concentrated sugar in your blood,
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=205s)** — well it pushes off into other fluids like in your eye as well as in your lens of the eye
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=211s)** — which can lead to cataracts. Number nine. Your pain and your inflammation will go down
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=218s)** — considerably. Boy, it's not until you reduce your sugars that you'll realize how much of that
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=223s)** — was contributing to either arthritis or inflammation or pain in your body. Until you eventually give it
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=228s)** — up and you're going to be amazed how much less inflammation you have in your body. Number ten.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=233s)** — You're bloating. Your abdominal pain will go down. But I had years of bloating and gallbladder
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=240s)** — problems and abdominal pain from eating so much sugar. Number eleven. Your sleep will be much
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=248s)** — better. I remember one time when I had really bad sleeping problems when I was consuming a
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=253s)** — lot of carbs. What did I do to solve it? Ate more carbs. In fact, I would consume, I'm not kidding,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=260s)** — a pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream before bed just to have like a just sugar coma so I can
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=265s)** — literally go to sleep. Little did I know that made things worse. I started having restless leg
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=271s)** — syndrome. Wake up in the middle of the night. I'd have to go run to get this energy out
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=275s)** — because I had all this energy. That was lactic acid coming from the buildup of all the
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=283s)** — the energy factories in my cell. Number twelve. You're going to feel really calm. Your adrenal
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=289s)** — stress that you might have will be much better. And if you have kids, you're going to notice
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=294s)** — that their demeanor is going to be better. They're going to be able to sit for longer
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=298s)** — periods of time. I mean think about how many kids are just wired on sugar. They're so
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=302s)** — restless. And one of the reasons is because all this sugar depletes you of B1 which will
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=307s)** — give you the symptom of nervous tension. If you want to see a really dramatic effect,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=312s)** — if someone has nervous tension or this buildup of stress, just give them some B1 and watch
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=318s)** — within three minutes. They're just going to feel nice and calm. Number thirteen. You're
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=322s)** — going to notice your skin is going to be much much better. Not just improving acne,
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=328s)** — but also dry skin, excessive oily skin. The overall color and tone of your skin is going
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=333s)** — to be much healthier. So those are some of the benefits. But check this out. I don't know
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=338s)** — if you've ever heard this before. There is something in the majority of the population's
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=344s)** — diet that is creating a sugar-like effect. It's something that's not sugar, but it acts like
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=352s)** — sugar. But it not just acts like sugar, it acts worse than sugar. And we're talking about
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=359s)** — refined starches in certain food products, if you want to call it that. They're basically
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=365s)** — classified under ultra-processed foods, aka junk foods. Let's take a look at... it used to be my
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=372s)** — favorite, right? So if we look at the ingredients, this has dried potatoes, vegetable oil.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=379s)** — It could be cottonseed, corn, or soy, or sunflower. And then it has corn flour,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=386s)** — okay, corn starch, rice flour, maltodextrin. So all of those are refined starches. So in other
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=396s)** — words, maltodextrin, modified corn starch, modified food starch, dextrin, basically are not
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=404s)** — sugars, but they have a huge effect on your blood sugars. Maltodextrin has an effect on the
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=414s)** — glucose. Glucose is 100. Table sugar is 65. So you can see it's like way worse than sugar,
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=421s)** — but it's not really a sugar. If we take a look at the total carbohydrates, it's 16. 16 grams.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=428s)** — The total sugars, zero. Zero sugars. So you might be saying, wow, that's great. It's no
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=435s)** — sugar. It's just carbohydrate. But this is going to turn into sugar so fast and raise your
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=444s)** — four teaspoons of sugar. And that is just one fifth of this. Okay. So it's like a,
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=450s)** — it's probably a stack of those chips about this big right here. Has four teaspoons of sugar.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=456s)** — You can imagine if you consume the whole thing, which I used to do without any hesitation
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=460s)** — that you're dumping a lot of sugar into your body, but it's not listed as sugar. So when I
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=466s)** — talk about getting rid of these sugars for two weeks, I'm talking about also the starches. But
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=472s)** — I want to show you one last thing. Okay. It's with this sir right here. It used to be one of my
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=477s)** — favorites, right? Fruity pebbles. Okay. And I want to show you how much sugar that's in here.
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=484s)** — First, starting with the actual sugar itself. Okay. The sugar that's labeled there,
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=490s)** — one cup of fruity pebbles. Okay. That's about 4.5. But if we had the starches that
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=495s)** — turn into sugar, because they're really sugars in reality, because they create a much more
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=499s)** — damaging effect, we have to add four more teaspoons. Okay. Actually five more teaspoons.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=506s)** — So that gives us a total of nine teaspoons per cup. All right. So you can see that this is a
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=512s)** — lot of sugar for one cup, right? Who consumes just one cup? An average child or adult is
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=518s)** — going to consume probably four cups per breakfast, right? So now we're talking about
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=525s)** — 36 teaspoons. So let's go ahead and add that. Okay. I'm not even at 36. I think you get the
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=530s)** — point. That's a lot of sugar for your breakfast. I found this one right here. It's called
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=534s)** — the granola bakery keto granola cinnamon pecan. Now check out the ingredients of this. Pecans,
- **[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=544s)** — almonds, dried coconut, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chicory root fiber, erythritol,
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=552s)** — coconut cream, coconut oil, cinnamon, monk fruit juice concentrate. That's not a lot of sugar by
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=560s)** — the way. Vanilla extract and sea salt. This is like one gram of sugar. Now it does have eight
- **[09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=567s)** — grams of carbs, but it has five grams of fiber. So if you deduct that, that is a three
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=573s)** — gram net carb with one gram of sugar. And this is not altered processed food. So it's
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=578s)** — not going to turn into sugar really fast. We're talking like one gram of sugar. If we compare
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=583s)** — to this one right here, one serving size, 150 calories roughly. This is like 36 grams of stuff
- **[09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=592s)** — that turns into sugar. This is one gram. So let's see 36 to one. Let's see which one I'm
- **[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=598s)** — going to pick here. Now if you'd like to find out exactly what diet you should do to make
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=602s)** — this easy, I put a link down below so you can download the plan, get started and start
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serJmA0YFD0&t=608s)** — experiencing the massive benefits of avoiding sugar.
