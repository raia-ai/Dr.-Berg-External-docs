- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=0s)** — You know, a lot of people love wheat products, right? Breads, pasta, cereal, crackers, biscuits,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=6s)** — waffles, pancakes, things like that. And so, if there is a way that you can actually eat wheat
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=12s)** — without any side effects at all, and you can have as much as you want, wouldn't that be great?
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=17s)** — And the answer is yes. There is a type of wheat that you can have as much as you want.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=22s)** — And you're going to be really excited about this. Well, I think I'm a little bit sarcastic,
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=27s)** — but you can have wheat in the form of wheatgrass. That's right, wheatgrass. Well, you're probably not
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=35s)** — too excited about that. But today I'm going to talk about some really interesting benefits of
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=41s)** — wheatgrass and what it can do for your health. Now, full disclosure, I do sell wheatgrass juice
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=47s)** — powder. Okay, I'm just telling you that before I start this video. And secondly, I'm not
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=51s)** — going to make any claims that consuming wheatgrass juice can do anything for your health,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=55s)** — prevent anything, help reduce the risk of any diseases. I just want to explain some of the
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=61s)** — research and there's some really interesting things about wheatgrass that I want to share
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=64s)** — with you. So what is the difference between wheat that you would use in making breads
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=70s)** — and pastas and things like that versus the wheat and the wheatgrass juice? Well, with all
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=76s)** — the breads and pastas and cereals and crackers, that is made with the seed of the plant. Okay,
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=83s)** — the grain. And wheatgrass is without the seed. It's the actual plant that the seed grows on.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=90s)** — And so you're consuming this in the microgreen phase, which is usually about seven to eight to
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=95s)** — nine or 10 days. A lot of different opinions about wheatgrass juice. Like it's the new
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=101s)** — age espresso. People use it in different cleansing detox programs. But I think the
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=107s)** — health of the wheatgrass is dependent on what it's grown on. So if you're going to the
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=113s)** — health food store and you're buying wheatgrass in trays that's grown on like this fiber,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=120s)** — coconut or nothing at all versus it grown on actual soil, I think there's a big difference
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=126s)** — in nutrition. Also you have products that are wheatgrass powder products versus wheatgrass
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=132s)** — juice powder. Very, very different. The wheatgrass juice powder is way more concentrated
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=138s)** — because it doesn't have any fiber in it. And it takes a tremendous amount of wheatgrass
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=142s)** — to make just a little bit of that wheatgrass juice powder. And there is several advantage
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=146s)** — of doing the wheatgrass juice powder because especially if you have irritable bowel,
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=151s)** — inflammation in your gut, you can't do fiber. I mean it's pretty bizarre to think
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=157s)** — Celiac disease, right, which is a severe intestinal inflammatory condition where
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=164s)** — you're getting destruction of the lining of your colon comes from gluten, which is in
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=170s)** — wheat products and other grains. Yet if you did the wheatgrass juice powder,
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=175s)** — it would not create that effect because there's no gluten in wheatgrass
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=178s)** — at all. So that's interesting. It's like opposite ends of the spectrum. The gluten
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=183s)** — is contained in the grain, which occurs later in the plant's cycle. If you capture
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=190s)** — a baby plant when it's very small, you avoid any of the grains. But it also means that you
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=197s)** — avoid a lot of the other things that are bad too, like the anti-nutrients, like phytic acid,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=203s)** — which blocks the absorption of certain minerals. So there's very, very low, if any, phytic
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=210s)** — acid in wheatgrass. But there's a lot in the grain because it's in that bran portion of the
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=216s)** — seed. Then you also have a great reduction of the tannins, which are also kind of toxic to
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=221s)** — people. And there is a much, much lower amount of oxlets, which can lead to kidney stones and
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=227s)** — can create arthritis or inflammation into the body. So with the wheatgrass juice, you have
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=231s)** — this interesting, very low anti-nutrients, no gluten. It's actually low carb and you get
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=239s)** — higher levels of nutrients. Okay, vitamin C, the precursor of vitamin A, beta carotene. You have
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=245s)** — a lot of the trace minerals, the minerals. And of course that depends on what it's grown on as
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=249s)** — well. You get the B vitamins, you get folate. And what's interesting, we had our wheatgrass
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=254s)** — juice powder tested and there were high levels of B12. Now, first of all, plants don't make
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=262s)** — B12. So apparently that B12 was created from a microorganism that lives within that plant.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=269s)** — Because one of the things that the farm that grows the wheatgrass juice powder that I use,
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=274s)** — they don't sterilize. So nothing is heated over 106 degrees. So you have microorganisms
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=281s)** — living that can survive that temperature. And so that can add an additional benefit. There's
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=290s)** — a lot of different things that you can do to make B12. I don't even consume it for the
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=291s)** — vitamins. I consume it for two other things. One is the chlorophyll, which 70% of wheatgrass
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=300s)** — juice is chlorophyll. And secondly, for all the phytonutrients, there are hundreds, if not
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=305s)** — thousands of phytonutrients in this microgreen and other microgreens that have all sorts of
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=312s)** — cool properties, which I'm going to talk about. But first let me just mention this chlorophyll
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=317s)** — compound. I don't know if you knew this, but chlorophyll is identical to your own blood,
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=323s)** — except for one little thing. Instead of iron, it contains magnesium. I mean, it's pretty wild
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=332s)** — that when someone consumes that green liquid from a plant, they're consuming something that
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=338s)** — so close to your blood, but with magnesium. It's pretty wild. And there's also studies that
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=344s)** — shows that chlorophyll can stimulate the production of your own red blood cells if you
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=351s)** — have anemia. And it also has the ability to stimulate the blood stem cells as well. But
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=358s)** — I'm not making any claims that it'll do anything for you. Just read the research on
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=362s)** — this yourself. Now let's just talk a little bit about the phytonutrients. Phytonutrients
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=367s)** — help to reduce the complications of a lot of different health problems. They have anti-inflammatory
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=373s)** — properties, antioxidant properties, antimicrobial properties. But the phytonutrients that I want
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=379s)** — to talk about today relate to a condition that I found some interesting research on,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=386s)** — and that's thalassemia. That is a genetic blood disorder where the person is not making
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=394s)** — hemoglobin, which is the protein that carries oxygen in your blood. So it's a type of anemia.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=400s)** — There's also some other problems with this disorder. You're not making enough
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=404s)** — white blood cells, leukocytes, and also you have a deficiency of thrombocytes. So we have
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=410s)** — low red blood cells, low white blood cells, and low thrombocytes, which actually have to do
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=417s)** — with the clotting factors. And so the problem is the treatment for this disorder
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=421s)** — has a lot of side effects. I mean one of the treatments is like a bone marrow replacement.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=428s)** — Other treatments involve bone marrow stimulants, blood transfusions, etc. etc. But there's some
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=435s)** — alternative treatments that they're trying with some pretty good effectiveness, and that has to
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=439s)** — do with wheatgrass. And they found through a research experiment, which I'll put down below,
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=444s)** — that there's something in wheatgrass juice that can increase your white blood cells,
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=449s)** — that can increase your red blood cells, that can also increase your thrombocytes. And so it's
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=454s)** — very good for anemia. But I want to mention again, this is just educational. I'm not making
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=458s)** — any claims it's going to do anything for you at all. Now it's very very inexpensive to make
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=463s)** — your own wheatgrass juice just by growing it. I highly recommend that you grow it in a tray
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=469s)** — of soil. Okay? And it only takes like seven days to grow it. So you can actually juice
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=474s)** — your own and use that tray to juice and then take your own shots. That would be a very
- **[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=479s)** — inexpensive yet super healthy way to get these phytonutrients. And since we're talking about
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=485s)** — concentrated phytonutrients, if you have not seen this video, you should check it out.
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNnUeeAiJko&t=490s)** — I put it up right here.
