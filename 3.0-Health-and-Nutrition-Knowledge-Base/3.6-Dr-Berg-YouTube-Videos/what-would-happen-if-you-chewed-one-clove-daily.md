- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=0s)** — Let's say, for example, you went two weeks with less than five hours of sleep each night.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=6s)** — What would actually happen? Now, some of you watching do get five hours of sleep or maybe six hours of sleep,
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=11s)** — but you don't get seven or eight hours of sleep.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=14s)** — So some of these symptoms I'm going to talk about can affect you, but more on a moderate or mild basis.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=21s)** — But what you need to know is there's a huge, huge consequence of not getting enough rest.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=27s)** — I remember as a kid, I slept so good, I would get nine hours of sleep.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=32s)** — And then I got a little bit older and went through basic training, and I was really awakened at four o'clock in the morning.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=38s)** — Well, ever since then, I tend to get up at four o'clock, and that's why I go to bed a little bit earlier to try to get that seven hours.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=46s)** — So I've had a really long history of poor sleep to the extreme, whereas some nights I don't even sleep one minute.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=54s)** — I laid there the entire night. Torture.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=58s)** — So ideally getting seven to eight hours of sleep is super healthy.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=62s)** — I looked at some research on this.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=63s)** — 35 years ago, the average U.S. adult slept 7.7 hours, which nowadays it's significantly less.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=72s)** — I mean, even if we compare 20 years ago to now, there's way more people getting less than six hours of sleep than just 20 years ago.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=80s)** — As a nation or even the world, we're just getting less and less sleep.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=84s)** — So let's go through all the consequences of not getting enough sleep, especially if you're not getting at least five hours of sleep.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=90s)** — OK, first of all, why do we need rest in the first place? Right.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=93s)** — Well, that's when a lot of things recover. That's when our muscles recover.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=97s)** — That's when we burn the most fat. That is when our bodies do the most detoxification.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=103s)** — That's when our brains detox.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=106s)** — And so this is why when you don't get enough sleep, you're going to feel kind of toxic, especially in your head.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=112s)** — So the first problem you're going to run into if you're not getting enough sleep is fatigue or what they call daytime sleepiness.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=118s)** — And there's nothing worse than driving when you're tired, right?
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=121s)** — Especially long road trips and you're just like dozing off at the road.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=124s)** — That could be very, very dangerous.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=126s)** — There are significant mood changes when you don't get enough sleep, way more than other types of cognitive problems like memory, attention and loss of focus.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=136s)** — Your mood will probably be one of the biggest things that will change.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=139s)** — You're no longer going to be happy and upbeat. You're going to be a bit depressed, agitated, and irritated.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=145s)** — Now, thinking about that, could you imagine how many people are put on psych drugs when really they just need a good night's rest?
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=155s)** — The next thing I want to mention is the cognitive function, mainly memory, focus and concentration.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=162s)** — So if you are a student, right, trying to study or you're someone that has to focus on some type of creativity.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=169s)** — Let's say you're a writer or you have to come up with content or you're a content creator like myself.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=175s)** — Boy, being tired just shuts that right down.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=177s)** — And so this is why I like the brain booster industry.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=180s)** — All these different pills that people take, you know, caffeine to try to stimulate their mental capacities to help them focus, not to mention drugs as well.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=189s)** — Unfortunately, that's treating the symptom and not the cause. And that's why the person always gets worse.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=194s)** — Very interesting study, which I'll put down below, involving 3000 students who all got poor sleep.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=200s)** — Well, actually less than six hours. There were mood changes. There were behavior changes.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=205s)** — There was an increased desire for alcohol. There were self-esteem issues. There were decreased ability to learn.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=213s)** — Even on top of that, there was an increased elevation of a suicide risk.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=217s)** — The other thing that happens when you don't get enough sleep is you have something called sympathetic hyperactivity.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=224s)** — There's a part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=228s)** — And that system is in overdrive when you're not sleeping. So you're going to have more adrenaline.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=235s)** — You're going to have more cortisol because your adrenals are revved up.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=239s)** — And so, yes, it is true that having an overactive sympathetic nervous system or a stressed out or overactive adrenal can keep you up.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=247s)** — But also, not getting enough sleep can then cause the adrenals and the stress and the sympathetics to kick in.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=254s)** — The sympathetic nervous system is kind of like the accelerator of the nervous system.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=258s)** — And you're not going to be able to sleep if it's accelerated.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=261s)** — And so it's the other system that kind of puts the brakes on this fight or flight mechanism.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=267s)** — That's called the parasympathetic. Both of these systems can be measured.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=270s)** — And I may or may not have information on this when you're looking down below, searching for it in the description, but I will very soon.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=280s)** — There's a great tool that you can actually visualize this part of the nervous system and see where you're at.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=285s)** — You can look at your stress and you can also look at your ability to recover and many other aspects related to that.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=292s)** — Like, should you really be working out today or not? Maybe you should be walking.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=297s)** — Because if you're not sleeping in your sympathetic overdrive or hyperactive,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=303s)** — you should not be exercising of any type of high intensity at all.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=308s)** — You should be walking because it's going to put more strain on your heart.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=312s)** — So this sympathetic overdrive, especially if it's chronic, okay, it goes on for weeks and weeks and weeks beyond just two weeks,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=319s)** — but might go on for months or years, really put stress on your heart.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=324s)** — You're going to be at risk for cardiovascular problems, at risk for a stroke, at risk for being a diabetic.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=332s)** — Why? Because cortisol and adrenaline releases sugar, which then increases insulin.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=341s)** — Despite not eating any sugar, your sugar levels will be higher because even the name of the adrenal hormones,
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=348s)** — another name for cortisol is glucocorticoids because it regulates glucose.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=353s)** — So this is why you have impairments with your glucose and problems with your blood sugars and insulin,
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=360s)** — which then relate to weight gain and a fatty liver.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=363s)** — The other very unique thing that happens with that cortisol being elevated is your immune system shuts down.
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=372s)** — It becomes paralyzed. When you have higher levels of cortisol, you have this lessening of the white blood cells.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=378s)** — They don't work. And this is why all of these conditions that involve autoimmune problems,
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=385s)** — where you have these antibodies attacking your own tissues, or even people with certain skin problems,
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=393s)** — allergies or inflammatory conditions because it's an overactive immune system, the general treatment is steroids.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=400s)** — What's a steroid? Cortisol. Because cortisol is anti-inflammatory, but it's also an immune suppressant.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=407s)** — If you can't sleep, right? You're getting less than five hours and you have this sympathetic overdrive
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=412s)** — and you're trying to lose weight. Good luck. It's not going to happen. In fact, you can work with someone on their diet.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=418s)** — But boy, if the sleep is not right, and they're also exercising at the same time, you're just wasting your time.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=424s)** — Getting someone into a wonderful rejuvenating sleep, that can create huge changes in weight loss.
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=430s)** — The next thing, getting less than five hours of sleep will impair your recovery.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=435s)** — I'm talking about recovery from an injury, recovery from stress, and recovery from exercise.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=444s)** — So most of the recovery, if not all the recovery from exercise, occurs when you are sleeping,
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=451s)** — if you are sleeping. And so if you're exercising and not sleeping, you're not going to see the
- **[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=457s)** — benefit of the exercise. You break down the body and you keep breaking it down, but you never
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=461s)** — recover. And you exercise over that, you'll have a lot of issues. So the rule of thumb is
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=465s)** — don't ever do high intensity exercise when you haven't slept and when you have poor recovery.
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=472s)** — You're not going to adapt and benefit from that exercise. But you can do walking. All right,
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=477s)** — the next thing I want to talk about is sleep apnea, because this also falls in this same area
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=483s)** — where the person is just not getting enough oxygen when they're sleeping. And that's why
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=487s)** — they have to use a CPAP machine to blow oxygen or sometimes just air into their upper respiratory
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=495s)** — and in their lungs. And this also includes a lot of people who have heavy snoring. And that
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=500s)** — creates something called hypoxia. Okay, that's just a lack of oxygen. And anytime you have a
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=505s)** — lack of oxygen, you also might have an extra increase of CO2. So not enough oxygen is bad.
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=512s)** — Too much CO2 is bad. It can be toxic. So you need the balance of both. You don't want
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=517s)** — oxygen either. You want some CO2 to allow that oxygen to penetrate deep into the cells. But you
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=523s)** — need the right balance. But when you have like sleep apnea and you're obstructing air going
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=529s)** — into your body, especially when you're sleeping, it can create even more severe
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=534s)** — problems with your body. Like brain atrophy. The frontal cortex actually atrophies and shrinks
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=541s)** — in people with bad sleep apnea because you're depriving the brain of oxygen when you're
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=546s)** — sleeping. You also can develop an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular incidents,
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=553s)** — and as well as strokes and diabetes. So there are many things you can do for sleep apnea.
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=558s)** — I have those in a lot of different videos, which I will put down below. Just for people
- **[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=562s)** — who don't get enough sleep, the most effective treatment for that right off the bat is taking a
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=568s)** — nap. Okay, just taking a nap or just trying to lay there until you hopefully fall asleep to
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=574s)** — some more sleep. A couple more tips on this topic. You want to keep your room on the cool side
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=580s)** — between 60 and 65 degrees, maybe up to 68 degrees, but keep it cool. If you can keep your
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=587s)** — window open, you'll sleep a little bit better. But having a room that's real stuffy and hot is
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=591s)** — not a good thing. If your humidity in the room is like 50%, you'll find that that will
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=597s)** — be the optimum humidity for the best sleep. Another really important thing is to turn off
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=602s)** — the electronics in your room, especially next to your head when you're sleeping. Why? Because
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=609s)** — this EMF wave stands for electromagnetic fields. Okay. And magnetic fields really affect the brain
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=619s)** — waves in the heart, and that can affect your quality of sleep big time. It did for me. In
- **[10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=625s)** — fact, I found the wires in the wall and back of my bed were crossed, and that was creating
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=630s)** — an electromagnetic field that extended eight feet from the wall. So I was being bathed in this
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=637s)** — magnet energy that just was not good for my heart. I started getting heart palpitations,
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=642s)** — and I eventually figured out what it was. And when I had the electrician fix it,
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=646s)** — all of those symptoms just magically disappeared. Another really important thing is the quantity
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=651s)** — of food that you eat, especially in the evening. Okay. If you do too much, you're
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=657s)** — well, because when you're bloated, that affects your sleeping up here. So you don't want to
- **[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=664s)** — overeat, and then you also don't want to under eat. Some people that don't consume enough
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=670s)** — protein or the right amount, they can also have a hard time getting to sleep, staying
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=675s)** — asleep, or waking up and feeling refreshed. So I think the key is to play around with the
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=682s)** — amount of protein that you need. And I would guess that would be anywhere between like three
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=686s)** — and a half to seven ounces of protein for that dinner, depending on a lot of different
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=692s)** — variables. You know, your size, your age, your activity level, your ability to digest that
- **[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=698s)** — protein. And it's best not to eat too late. It's best to eat earlier. Okay. You're going
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=703s)** — to find you're going to sleep better if you can not have a lot of stuff going on with the
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=709s)** — digestive system. And the other thing is as it starts to get darker, and let's say six,
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=714s)** — seven o'clock, start dimming the lights wherever you are at. Try not to sit in front of a computer
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=720s)** — screen because that blue light, especially the artificial lights, can interfere with
- **[12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=726s)** — the whole mechanism of the light going into the retina, which then goes to a whole cascade
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=733s)** — of things that increases your melatonin. Darkness triggers melatonin. Light decreases
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=739s)** — melatonin. Melatonin helps you sleep. So it's best that you tone down the light in the evening.
- **[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=745s)** — Now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube,
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=750s)** — it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's a lot of content that I cannot
- **[12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwxOavvgqA0&t=755s)** — put on YouTube, unfortunately. So to make sure you have full access of all my information,
