- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=0s)** — So why are people talking about this? The root cause of autoimmune diseases. I'm not sure if you
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=5s)** — know this or not, but autoimmune diseases are surpassing heart disease and cancer. It is
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=11s)** — rapidly becoming the number one health problem on planet earth. Check out this chart. Look at the
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=17s)** — trends of MS, type 1 diabetes, celiac, thyroid diseases. I'm talking about Hashimoto's, Crohn's.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=24s)** — Now there's a lot of other diseases now that are just exploding, but autoimmune diseases are
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=29s)** — straight up and vertical. Yet very few people are talking about something so obvious. Hopefully this
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=37s)** — video will inspire certain doctors to start to look into this solution. Your immune system has
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=42s)** — an extremely important job of differentiating self from non-self. I'm talking about your own
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=49s)** — cells from other things that are not your cells like pathogens, like viruses, bacteria,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=55s)** — things like that. Before I dive right into this, I want to give you just a real quick
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=58s)** — foundation. You have two parts of the immune system. You have the part that you were born
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=63s)** — with that your mother gave you, and that's called the innate immune system. And then you
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=67s)** — also have the acquired immune system. The acquired immune system is created through a series
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=74s)** — of infections. So you get infected, you get a bacterial, a virus infection, and then your
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=81s)** — immune system reacts and learns from that. So the next time that you get exposed to that
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=86s)** — you now have protection. The innate system doesn't have a memory. It's just there waiting to
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=92s)** — protect and it's going to instantly react to any type of pathogen. Whereas the acquired immune
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=98s)** — system could take hours or even days before it kicks in. So it's slow and adapting. But over
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=105s)** — time that acquired immune system learns and becomes stronger, whereas the innate system doesn't.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=111s)** — It actually gets weaker as you get older. And the last point I want to make is that your
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=116s)** — innate immune system is not the problem involved with autoimmune diseases. It's the acquired
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=122s)** — immune system. What common thread runs through all autoimmune diseases as it relates to the
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=129s)** — immune system? One big thing is the regulatory T cells. They call them the T reg
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=135s)** — cells. These T reg cells have a very important job in preventing autoimmune diseases.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=141s)** — There's another name for them as well and that's called the suppressor T cells. They're the
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=146s)** — peacemakers of your immune system. Another function of these T reg cells is to stop the immune
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=152s)** — reaction after the immune system has done its job. But they're there to keep everything in
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=156s)** — check. There's certain drugs that they use but prednisone is a common drug that's used with
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=162s)** — autoimmune diseases. Now prednisone is a synthetic version of cortisol. That's the stress
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=168s)** — So what I want to do is I want to just take a look at prednisone as a treatment for autoimmune
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=174s)** — diseases and what it actually is doing and then compare that to something else that has the
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=180s)** — largest ability to regulate the immune system of anything and that is vitamin D. So vitamin D
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=187s)** — empowers, enhances the immune system depending on what's happening. Both prednisone and vitamin D
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=193s)** — have anti-inflammatory effects. A little different mechanism but they both reduce
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=198s)** — inflammation. But prednisone suppresses both parts of the immune system, the innate and the
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=204s)** — acquired. So if you're having a reaction on your skin like a rash or some inflammation,
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=208s)** — it's going to go away. In fact, I used to have prednisone every year for probably 10
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=213s)** — years in my 20s because of the darn poison ivy I was exposed to. Now vitamin D shifts
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=218s)** — the immune system to increase the T cells. Let's just pause for a second. How important is that
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=225s)** — information? It's huge because in autoimmune diseases we have a lowering of the T reg
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=231s)** — cells and we have this out of control inflammatory situation. But this is very,
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=235s)** — very important information. There are two other immune things that are usually too high
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=240s)** — when someone has this autoimmune disease. TH1 and TH17. Those two immune factors are high
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=247s)** — autoimmune and the T reg cell is low. Vitamin D suppresses both of those cells that create
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=253s)** — that inflammation. Now prednisone and vitamin D have some similar things, but they have a
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=259s)** — few things that are different as well. Let's first take blood glucose. Prednisone will mobilize
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=265s)** — and break down your protein and turn that into glucose. So it raises blood glucose.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=271s)** — It increases your risk for getting diabetes, but vitamin D does not. Vitamin D enhances the
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=276s)** — glucose level of your blood. It's a cell that makes insulin and it helps to regulate your blood
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=279s)** — sugars. Prednisone causes a breakdown of your bone. It can cause osteoporosis,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=286s)** — whereas vitamin D helps you absorb calcium and supports bone mineralization. Now as we age,
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=293s)** — our immune system goes down, especially because our thymus gland, which is the
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=297s)** — master gland right on top of our heart, shrivels up and it's virtually almost
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=302s)** — non-existent as we get older. That is the gland that makes all those T cells. Vitamin D helps
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=308s)** — to slow down this process, but not if you're using the normal small recommended dosage of
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=316s)** — vitamin D that a lot of doctors recommend. You have to use higher doses or doses that
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=319s)** — are therapeutic. Now I want to mention just one interesting book. I don't know if you
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=324s)** — could see this right here, but this book says What Really Causes MS by Harold Foster.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=330s)** — There's a chapter on sunlight. And in that book, Harold Foster talks about a really
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=336s)** — interesting strong association between someone developing MS and where they live on the planet.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=342s)** — The closer they are to the equator, where you get a lot of sun, the less MS you're going to
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=348s)** — have. Now that data also correlates with other autoimmune diseases, which I'm not going
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=352s)** — to get into in this video, but I'll put a link down below. I do want to also mention
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=356s)** — Jeff Bowles' book right here, which is The Cure for and Prevention of All Diseases,
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=361s)** — where he talks a lot about using high doses of vitamin D3. But what I like about this book is
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=366s)** — he emphasizes the cofactors, okay? Because vitamin D doesn't work without these cofactors
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=372s)** — like magnesium, vitamin K2. I interviewed one of the pioneers of vitamin D research,
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=377s)** — Dr. Bruce Hollis. Dr. Hollis told me that if there's any positive studies on vitamin D,
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=384s)** — it's very unlikely they're going to publish those. And I said, why is that? He said,
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=388s)** — because there's no profit in a remedy that is free. The sun. You could, if you expose
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=393s)** — yourself to the sun, get all the vitamin D that you need. There's a lot of competing drugs
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=397s)** — that do not want that information out there. There are two systems of vitamin D. Vitamin D
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=403s)** — affecting your bone and calcium, okay? But there's another system that doesn't involve
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=409s)** — calcium. It doesn't involve your bone. It involves supporting your immune system. You see,
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=414s)** — bone system can get by with a small amount of vitamin D once every two weeks, but the other
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=421s)** — system needs higher amounts in daily amounts. But for cancer, you want to go way up from 10,000.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=426s)** — You want to probably do 50,000 I use every single day with the magnesium, with the K2,
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=431s)** — with the zinc. Now at this point, I want to make a disclaimer. I am not telling you that
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=435s)** — this is going to cure your cancer. I am just giving you some additional information, especially
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=438s)** — since the World Health Organization even acknowledges that vitamin D has anti-carcinogenic
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=444s)** — properties. Now I want to talk about some more research by a doctor out of Brazil
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=448s)** — called Dr. Coimbra. They call it the Coimbra Protocol. What this protocol is about is to
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=454s)** — increase the vitamin D to penetrate the resistance. They start increasing the vitamin D
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=459s)** — as you're taking this test to the point where the parathyroid hormone goes to like a low
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=465s)** — normal. That means that this vitamin D is penetrating and it's working. So that's just
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=470s)** — things they do in this protocol. To me, it's so obvious what the problem is and what the
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=474s)** — solution is. And then there's another interesting tactic, which I think was created by Big Pharma,
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=480s)** — and that was that vitamin D in high amounts is toxic. Well, there's a difference between
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx5vxhx6fsU&t=486s)** — therapeutic dosages and toxicity. And for that information, you should watch this video right here.
