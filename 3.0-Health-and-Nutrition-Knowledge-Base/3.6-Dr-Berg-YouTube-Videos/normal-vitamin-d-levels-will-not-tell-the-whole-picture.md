- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=0s)** — We all know how important vitamin D is, but it's also incredibly confusing to know amounts that you need.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=7s)** — And does the amount of vitamin D in your blood really tell you what's going on in the cells?
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=12s)** — Now, when you get your blood test done with vitamin D, some references give you this normal
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=18s)** — range between 20 to 40 nanograms per milliliter. Other references are between 30 and 50 nanograms
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=28s)** — per milliliter. And of course, if you're in a different part of the world, there's different values.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=33s)** — So, for example, if you have 50 nanograms per milliliter, that would be 125 nanomoles per liter.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=41s)** — So, as you can see, it's very, very confusing. And especially if you take vitamin D, which is
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=46s)** — in a different measurement altogether, which is in international units. Even that's very
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=59s)** — micrograms. And when you talk about other things like beta carotene or retinol,
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=65s)** — it's in a completely different system. It doesn't equal what I just mentioned. So it's very
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=70s)** — confusing. Even the RDAs for vitamin D for someone that's under 70 years old is 600 IUs.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=80s)** — Okay. Which is 15 micrograms. And the studies that validate that amount, which is
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=86s)** — extremely low, were done years ago designed to prevent rickets. But that was way before
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=92s)** — all this new information on how vitamin D supports the immune system and so many other
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=98s)** — biological systems. So checking your vitamin D levels in the blood is all fine. And that's
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=103s)** — great. But the most important thing about vitamin D is does it reach the cell? And it
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=116s)** — the blood levels of vitamin D to determine what's going on in your cell.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=121s)** — Simply because there are so many problems with the vitamin D receptor. Certain viruses and
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=126s)** — other pathogens have a mechanism, a survival mechanism of blocking your vitamin D receptor
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=133s)** — for their survival because they know that that vitamin D goes into that cell. They're
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=146s)** — receptor to make sure you don't get enough because of this huge association between vitamin
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=152s)** — D and the reduction of cancer risk. I mean, if you think about even in a benign tumor,
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=157s)** — you get it like a 93% absorption with that vitamin D receptor. But in a malignant cancer,
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=164s)** — the vitamin D receptor now goes from 93 down to 56 absorption. So you can see that cancer
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=171s)** — tends to block the absorption of vitamin D. And about 30% of the population has a genetic
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=176s)** — problem with the vitamin D receptor, including myself. So normal amounts of vitamin D do not
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=183s)** — make the changes that I need. So what do we do? How do we solve this problem? Well,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=188s)** — number one might be a good idea to get a genetic test to measure your vitamin D receptor.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=192s)** — But there's some other simple things you can do. Does vitamin D receptor diseases and
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=198s)** — problems run in your family or do you have a problem with those? And I'm going to list them
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=202s)** — right now, but there are so many diseases and health related conditions that are directly
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=209s)** — related to a problem with the vitamin D receptor. So let me just go down the list right now.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=214s)** — Autoimmune diseases. And this includes MS, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=222s)** — Hashimoto's, ankylosing spinalitis. The next category, certain types of cancer,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=228s)** — especially breast cancer and colon cancer. You just have to realize how important vitamin D is
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=235s)** — for so many things, including every aspect of your immune system that fights off cancer.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=241s)** — Normally the immune cells are supposed to kill cancer if they have enough vitamin D,
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=246s)** — but not if they don't have enough vitamin D. Certain cardiovascular diseases are related
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=251s)** — to a problem with the vitamin D receptor. Certain cognitive diseases, including Alzheimer's,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=256s)** — Parkinson's are associated with a problem with the vitamin D receptor. Then we have diabetes,
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=261s)** — type 1 and type 2. And type 1 is an autoimmune disease. So that would definitely fit into
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=266s)** — that vitamin D problem. Next one is metabolic syndrome, which includes high blood pressure,
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=272s)** — lipid problems, high blood glucose or diabetes. Next one is TB. Okay.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=280s)** — Tuberculosis, which is a huge problem with the vitamin D receptor. In fact, years ago,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=286s)** — some of the earlier treatments for TB was just getting out in the sun. And that would greatly
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=290s)** — help TB because of the production of vitamin D. And if you ever have the choice between
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=295s)** — getting your vitamin D from a pill form versus the sun, you'd be better to get it from the
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=301s)** — sun. Okay. That would be the ideal situation if you can get vitamin D from the sun. So we
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=306s)** — have TB. We also have certain viruses, parasites, some bacteria. Lyme disease,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=312s)** — definitely associated with a vitamin D receptor issue. Hair loss, Crohn's, other types of GI
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=319s)** — inflammation issues. Because what you have to remember is that vitamin D is probably one of
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=325s)** — the best natural anti-inflammatories. And then we get respiratory infections, huge association
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=333s)** — with a vitamin D receptor, probably because there's certain viruses involved that tend to
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=337s)** — hijack the vitamin D receptor. And then we get asthma. If a child has asthma and you get them
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=343s)** — to be outside in the fresh air and the sun, boy, their rate of getting asthma just goes way
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=349s)** — down. Food allergies. Okay. The more food allergies you have, the more problems you have
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=354s)** — with the vitamin D receptor. And then we get a really common thing, a low back pain,
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=358s)** — definitely associated with the vitamin D. Vitiligo, a situation where you have a lack of pigment
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=364s)** — in certain places in your body. Then you have osteoporosis, COPD, which is chronic
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=369s)** — obstructive pulmonary disease. And then even PTSD is associated with low vitamin D,
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=376s)** — probably because vitamin D greatly helps depression. All right. So beyond checking your
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=382s)** — blood, which is good to do, but if you still have problems, you're probably going to
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=388s)** — take more vitamin D. So number one, take more vitamin D. It's that simple. And you might
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=394s)** — need 20, 30, 40, 50,000 IUs. If you start seeing changes, then we know, regardless of
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=402s)** — how much vitamin D you have in your blood, that you were deficient in the cell because you
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=407s)** — had a vitamin D receptor issue. All right. Number two, take it inconsistently. Like
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=412s)** — instead of taking it on a regular basis, okay. You might want to take it once every three
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=417s)** — days or once every four days and take a good amount. Apparently that's a good strategy for
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=422s)** — certain people that have a problem with the vitamin D receptor. Even though I personally have
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=426s)** — a problem with vitamin D, I do take it consistently each day just because it's easy
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=431s)** — to remember. But if I had an autoimmune disease or some of these other problems,
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=434s)** — I might take it sporadically. You can take magnesium. That will help the vitamin D
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=440s)** — receptor. You can take zinc. You can take bile salts. Now, bile salts are interesting
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=446s)** — because they act as a vitamin D receptor analog. What does that mean? It means that you can
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=452s)** — trigger the gene for vitamin D without necessarily taking vitamin D. It's pretty wild. You can
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=460s)** — take it in the form of tutka as well or just bile salts. Omega-3 has been known to increase
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=467s)** — the vitamin D receptor. Vitamin K2 also helps. And then you have various plant chemicals
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=475s)** — that are also really good to increase the reception of the vitamin D receptor, like
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=481s)** — resveratrol, curcumin, curcetin, and sulforaphane. All of those can greatly help. And the last
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=489s)** — thing that can help vitamin D is butyrate. Now, what's butyrate? That is a short-chain
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=494s)** — fatty acid that's produced by your own microbes. And you can increase the production of that if
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=501s)** — you consume vegetables. Because the vegetables provide fiber for the microbes, they eat that,
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=506s)** — they convert it to butyrate, and then that can help your absorption of vitamin D. It can also
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=511s)** — help you with insulin resistance. And butyrate is a form of a ketone. So, of course, I would
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=517s)** — recommend also being on the ketogenic diet, which will help insulin resistance. Now, the
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=523s)** — question that I always get about vitamin D is this toxicity question. I have a very good
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=529s)** — explanation of the true toxicity from vitamin D. If you haven't seen this video, check it out.
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WCY_tqys8&t=536s)** — I put it up right here.
