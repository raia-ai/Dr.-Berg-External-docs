- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=0s)** — So, there's one food that you want to eat if you want to shrink an enlarged prostate. Prostate is a gland
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=8s)** — that wraps around this little tube underneath your bladder. And when it gets bigger, normally it
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=14s)** — should be like the size of a walnut, when it enlarges, it kind of interferes with the urine
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=19s)** — flow and that can keep you up at night. And an enlarged prostate can also turn into a cancer
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=26s)** — and the name that they use for this enlarged prostate is called benign prostatic hyperplasia.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=33s)** — What's involved here? Well, this is kind of what the theory is. In order for the prostate to enlarge,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=38s)** — you have to have certain type of hormones that activate it. Okay, and one is called testosterone
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=45s)** — because testosterone is a anabolic hormone that, you know, helps your muscles grow. So,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=52s)** — testosterone, through the help of a certain enzyme, will convert into DHT, which is a more
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=57s)** — powerful form of testosterone. And apparently this DHT is involved in the enlargement of
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=63s)** — the prostate. And so the mechanism of one of the top-selling drugs for this condition
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=67s)** — inhibits that enzyme to reduce DHT. As we age, testosterone goes down. DHT also goes down.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=77s)** — And also as men age, the prostate enlarges. So how can that be a solution since DHT
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=85s)** — is normally lower as we get older? It's very confusing. So in other words, apparently the real
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=90s)** — problem is that as we age, that enzyme increases in its activity, thereby giving you
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=98s)** — more DHT and creating a more profound effect over the prostate. As far as the top medication,
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=106s)** — they found that by taking the medication, you can decrease the enlargement of your prostate by
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=110s)** — about 23%. But there's some slight minor complications, side effects. Decreased libido,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=119s)** — increased risk of prostate cancer, as well as a syndrome that can occur when you stop taking
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=125s)** — the medication. And that syndrome has other side effects, like signs of suicidal impulses,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=130s)** — atrophy of the penis, and the development of breast tissue. But other than that,
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=136s)** — it's totally fine. The question is there a natural inhibitor of this enzyme? The answer is
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=141s)** — yes. In one study, it showed that it can decrease the risk of a prostate enlargement
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=146s)** — by 21% and prostate cancer. This natural enzyme inhibitor also decreases inflammation. It has a
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=160s)** — Now lycopene is called a carotenoid, which is a kind of a category of a lot of different plant
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=166s)** — based compounds. And lycopene is in watermelon, it's in carrot, and it's even in grapefruit.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=173s)** — But if you want to get a large amount of lycopene, you want to get it from
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=177s)** — tomatoes. If you can get them from your garden or the farmers market, that would be great.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=181s)** — You can get them as canned tomatoes, or tomato sauce, or tomato paste. Because apparently,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=188s)** — the lycopene in tomatoes becomes more bioavailable when you heat the tomato. Of course,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=196s)** — don't get the tomato sauce that has the sugar added. Get the one that is as natural as
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=200s)** — possible. Now the other interesting thing about lycopene is it's a fat soluble compound. Which
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=206s)** — means that if you're cooking with tomatoes, you want to add a little olive oil with it.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=211s)** — Because the extra fat with heat will help extract more of that lycopene from it.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=215s)** — If you just include maybe twice a week some type of tomato dish, whether these tomatoes are on
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=222s)** — your salad or in some type of dish, that would be a really great thing for your prostate.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=228s)** — So there are other things you can take to help your prostate. Zinc is at the top of the
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=232s)** — list. Rosveratrol is another compound that they used with lycopene. Now as a side note,
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=238s)** — probably the worst thing for the prostate is milk. Because there's certain growth hormones
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=245s)** — in milk that can enlarge the prostate as well. And even when I was in practice, I remember several
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=250s)** — older men coming in and explaining that every time they consume some dairy, when they would wake
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=256s)** — up the next morning, they had a much worse time urinating. Probably because of the enlargement
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=261s)** — of the prostate. So dairy is something you would want to avoid. Now that you know the best food
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=265s)** — for the prostate, the next thing you need to know is what to avoid. There are four things
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx42_D5bTas&t=270s)** — to avoid to prevent an enlarged prostate. And I put that in this video right here. Check it out.
