- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=0s)** — The number one cause of heart disease is now what you think. I called up a heart surgeon, a friend,
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=5s)** — Dr. Philip Ovadia. And I asked, do you ever see this problem when you do open heart surgeries?
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=10s)** — And he said nearly 100% of the time. It's a type of visceral fat around the heart itself.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=16s)** — What's unique about this fat is it directly contacts the heart muscle and the arteries
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=22s)** — itself. So that means the inflammation from this type of fat goes directly into the heart
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=28s)** — first before any other place in the body. The big question is what causes this layer of fat?
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=34s)** — And so the key to this whole story is insulin. If insulin is high, you're going to get really fat.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=38s)** — You're going to start gaining weight. When insulin is low, everything is reversed. You're
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=42s)** — going to lose weight and get rid of fat, especially the fat surrounding the heart. This
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=46s)** — problem with the fat around the heart relates to something called insulin resistance. Very simply,
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=51s)** — the receptor for insulin is no longer accepting insulin. That's what insulin resistance is.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=58s)** — Now the problem is where does the fat go? It accumulates around the liver as a fatty liver,
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=62s)** — accumulates around the organs as visceral fat. I'm going to give you
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=65s)** — seven clues to determine if you have insulin resistance. Number one, if you're a guy
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=71s)** — and your waist is greater than 40 inches, chances are you have insulin resistance. If
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=75s)** — you're female and you have a waist size that's over 35 inches, chances are you might have
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=80s)** — insulin resistance. Next one, if you have a skin tag or even like this darkened pigment
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=86s)** — underneath the armpits in your groin, think insulin resistance. If your triglycerides are
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=91s)** — high or you have low HDL, think insulin resistance. If you have difficulty losing weight,
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=96s)** — you probably have insulin resistance. And the last clue is that you just can't go
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=100s)** — very long without needing a meal. Fasting is difficult. That's called insulin resistance. But
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=105s)** — this leads to a bigger question. What actually causes insulin resistance? Yes, starches like
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=111s)** — potato, pasta, bread, cereal crackers, and all that stuff as well. Definitely out of a lot of
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=116s)** — these, fructose is at the top of the list. But there's other causes like stress or even
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=122s)** — having a chronic problem with your sleep where you just don't sleep that well. Maybe you have
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=126s)** — sleep apnea or you just don't sleep. That can set you up for insulin resistance. This is
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=130s)** — why people crave maybe junk food or sugar if they haven't slept or they're under stress.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=134s)** — But there's one other big cause to insulin resistance you need to know about. Seed oils.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=140s)** — That's right. Seed oils. Some people will say the omega-6 fatty acids are essential,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=144s)** — which they are. But you know a lot of these studies never look at oxidation from these oils.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=152s)** — You see these omega-6 oils are very, very fragile, very vulnerable to oxygen, heat,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=159s)** — and light. But do you ever notice when they make seed oils? Like this could sit on the
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=163s)** — shelf. It doesn't even have to be refrigerated for a very long time. How do they get it to
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=167s)** — These industrial seed oils are highly processed with high heats, with chemicals like hexane,
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=174s)** — which is in your gasoline. And so that when you consume this stuff, it gets stuck in your
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=180s)** — cells for like a year and a half. That is a major contributor to the insulin receptor damage
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=187s)** — on the surface of that cell. And especially since the average person consumes literally 25%
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=193s)** — to 30% of their calories being these oils. Here a person is, they go on the ketogenic diet,
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=200s)** — the low-carb diet, and they're not eating sugars anymore, and they're not consuming
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=205s)** — starches, and they're feeling better. But maybe their inflammation is not going away. Maybe
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=209s)** — they're not reversing their heart problems. And maybe they're not even correcting insulin
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=214s)** — resistance because the ketogenic low-carb diet is a low-carb diet. It's not a low-seed oil
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=222s)** — diet. But if you read my book, I talk about the healthy version of the ketogenic diet.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=227s)** — I'm talking about doing the low-carb diet with higher quality ingredients. Cooking with butter,
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=232s)** — tallow, maybe coconut oil, using olive oil, not the seed oil dressing. So one of the root
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=237s)** — causes for heart disease is the epicardial fat, which comes mostly from the combination
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=244s)** — of sugar, starches, but definitely seed oils. Aka, if you add all those up, you get
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=251s)** — ultra-processed foods. But the good news is there's some really quick things to do to get
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=256s)** — rid of this fat. So number one, get rid of the seed oils, replace it with healthy oils. I'll put
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=261s)** — a link down below for more details. Number two, go on a low-carb, low-starch diet, aka keto
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=267s)** — diet. The other interesting thing about this fat is it's not like regular fat. It's right
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=271s)** — in the center. It's like a beige color. Of course, this is yellow, but it's really beige,
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=276s)** — which means it's right in the middle. But it does respond very well to things that also
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=281s)** — stimulate brown fat, like cold therapy, like taking a cold shower. Cold immersion tanks
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=288s)** — are really good to help with this. It's one of the fastest ways to drop your insulin,
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=293s)** — okay? Because it's the chronic insulin production that really creates the problem. So if we just
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=298s)** — reverse the flow and not increase insulin by not eating, we can quickly turn things around.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=303s)** — So I would recommend two meals a day with your first one at lunch and your second one at dinner
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=307s)** — and absolutely, positively no snacks because it's the snacks that destroy the ability to get
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=313s)** — rid of this fat. And it's something that's been introduced as a normal thing that we need to
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=318s)** — snack between meals, which is totally the worst habit you can do. And what's really
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=323s)** — interesting, the type of exercise you do matters. I mean, just one bout of high-intensity
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=329s)** — interval training can actually make your receptors for insulin more sensitive significantly.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=334s)** — So do not forget about exercise. And that high-intensity interval training works better
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=339s)** — than a moderate intensity of running or jogging a long distance because of the cortisol spike
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=344s)** — that happens when you do that. Two other things that can help you. Number one is doing
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=347s)** — apple cider vinegar a few times a day in some water, like one tablespoon in a glass of water.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=352s)** — And then berberine is also something that can help you speed up the process. And to get the
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLrMpB5Bgtk&t=357s)** — details on how to do intermittent fasting, you should watch this video right here.
