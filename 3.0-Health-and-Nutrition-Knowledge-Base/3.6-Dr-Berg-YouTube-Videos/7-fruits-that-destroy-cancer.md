- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=0s)** — Today we're going to talk about seven fruits that have the potential to kill cancer. How does a
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=5s)** — fruit or a plant ever come up with this chemical to kill cancer since that plant or fruit doesn't
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=14s)** — normally get cancer like humans get? We will also answer the question of the sugar in fruits, right?
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=21s)** — Because people might know that fruits are high in sugar and cancer loves sugar. All right,
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=26s)** — let's first dive into number one. Berries. But there's two specific berries that have more
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=32s)** — cancer fighting potential than other berries and that would be the blueberry and the blackberry
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=38s)** — because they have a lot more of this thing called anthocyanins that has all sorts of
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=44s)** — interesting properties. One being the inhibiting of cancer growth. Okay, now anthocyanins also
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=53s)** — feed your gut microbes. Like 80% of your immune system is in your gut microbiome. So your gut
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=60s)** — microbes love to eat these plant-based chemicals. You strengthen them, they become more diverse,
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=66s)** — and they increase in number. There's some pretty great, incredible research on anthocyanins
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=72s)** — decreasing breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer. Now, I will say they're
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=77s)** — observational studies, but still the research is pretty strong. If you can just imagine like,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=81s)** — yeah, we just discovered that you can actually help inhibit cancer by eating healthier, right?
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=86s)** — Who's going to fund that? And that goes right up against pharmaceutical companies.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=90s)** — It's not going to happen. There's just so many other things that go way beyond just cancer.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=95s)** — We're talking about anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial. All right, so let's go to
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=99s)** — number two. Citrus fruits, right? This is lemon, limes, grapefruit. Not only are they
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=107s)** — loaded with vitamin C, which helps your immune system, but they're loaded with flavonoids.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=113s)** — One being the detoxification of cancer-causing agents. So in other words, it strengthens the
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=120s)** — liver's ability to turn these carcinogens into harmless particles. So if you regularly
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=126s)** — consume citrus fruits, whether it's also like lemon in the water, things like that,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=131s)** — you may decrease your risk for certain types of cancer, especially of the digestive system.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=136s)** — Next one is pomegranates. Pomegranates are rich in a certain nutrient called
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=143s)** — elegic acid. It also has anti-cancer properties. These compounds work over time to protect your
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=149s)** — DNA from damage. You have to realize that a cancer cell came from a normal cell. Cancer
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=155s)** — really is a normal cell that has damage that then has to survive. And so it starts to morph
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=161s)** — into some other type of metabolism. There's a lot of other phytonutrients in pomegranates
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=166s)** — that do a lot of different things as well. Decrease inflammation, decrease oxidative stress.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=173s)** — All right, the next one is grapes. Now what are grapes known for? Well,
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=177s)** — the phytonutrient called resveratrol. Resveratrol is known to help decrease aging.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=183s)** — And one of the reasons why someone can extend their age is they're not dying from certain
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=187s)** — things. So resveratrol is a very thoroughly researched phytonutrient that has all sorts of
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=193s)** — properties. One being a superhero anti-cancer effect that can bulletproof your cells from
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=201s)** — experiencing excessive amounts of stress that can then cause the triggering of the cancer.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=207s)** — The next one on the list is tomatoes. Yes, tomatoes are really a fruit, even though you
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=212s)** — might have thought it was a vegetable. Tomatoes are loaded with something called
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=216s)** — lycopene. Now you actually can increase the amount of lycopene if you cook the tomato,
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=221s)** — as in tomato sauce. Now I have a huge garden of tomatoes, all different kinds. And because I'm
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=228s)** — experimenting on different types of tomatoes, I have dark purple ones, the green and yellow
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=233s)** — ones. I have all different types. And those colors represent different pigments, different
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=238s)** — phytonutrients. So I'm going to experiment on this and see which ones I like as far as taste,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=243s)** — see which ones are not as destroyed by insects and bugs. And then also I'm going to send
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=247s)** — them to the lab to see what the heck is in these tomatoes. All right, next one, avocados.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=252s)** — First thing that avocados have is glutathione. That's a super powerful antioxidant that can
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=258s)** — protect your cells against what's called carcinogens, which are things that cause
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=263s)** — cancer. The more glutathione you can consume from actual food, the better. The other thing
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=269s)** — that avocados have are certain phytonutrients that specifically target cancer stem cells. And
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=276s)** — those are the cells that are not turned into a cancer cell yet, but they're going to. So if you
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=281s)** — can slow those down, you get at the root of cancer. All right, the last one on the list is
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=288s)** — olives. Yes, an olive is a fruit as well. Olives have something called allylropane,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=294s)** — and another one called hydroxytyrosal. Both protect you against the growth of cancer cells.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=300s)** — Olives are like a natural shield. They protect the body from the inside out. Another cool
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=305s)** — thing about olives is that these phytonutrients increase something called apoptosis. When the
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=312s)** — cell is sick, it naturally commits suicide to protect the whole body. So the phytonutrient
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=318s)** — in olives can help cause the cancer cell to commit suicide. So that's a really good thing.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=324s)** — All right, so now let's talk about how a fruit actually developed these compounds in
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=327s)** — the first place. These plants have developed certain compounds to help them survive as a
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=335s)** — defense mechanism against the stress from UV radiation, pathogens, viruses, other bacteria.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=342s)** — They can't run away from anything, so they have to develop all these compounds to teach
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=346s)** — whoever eats them a lesson. So these anti-cancer plant-based chemicals also inhibit certain
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=353s)** — enzymes. Some of the phytonutrients also increase what's called autophagy. What happens
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=358s)** — is it causes your body to start eating damaged cells and then turn those into new proteins.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=365s)** — And also some of the plant-based chemicals that kill insects create a very mild short-term
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=371s)** — stress in our body that then causes our body to compensate and become stronger. Think about
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=376s)** — this. If a child never gets sick, they won't have an immune system. And having the body
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=381s)** — learn from that and become stronger, it's not good to eliminate all stress. These
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=386s)** — chemicals are not necessarily just killing or dissolving this cancer. They're getting rid
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=391s)** — of the things that turn into cancer. The inflammation, they're supporting the gut microbe
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=397s)** — around the cancer. And so even if there's more sugar in the fruit, the different phytonutrients
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=403s)** — with the fiber itself all buffer a lot of that sugar. So it's not like eating a candy
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=408s)** — bar at all. So I really think that food should be our medicine. Unfortunately, the medical
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=414s)** — does not look at food as medicine. And it's just bizarre to me to think that you can get
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=419s)** — healthy by taking a poison. I'm sorry, a medication. Currently, I'm involved in doing
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=423s)** — research on cancer with a group out of Europe. And we published several amazing studies on
- **[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=430s)** — cancer using these natural compounds in plants because they have virtually no side effects,
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=437s)** — as chemo does have massive side effects. That's the problem with trying to address
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=442s)** — cancer to kill it off. You need to use something in the body that does not have
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVgfijICfrI&t=446s)** — the toxic effects. So check it out down below and I will see you in the next video.
