- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about the relationship between heavy metal toxicity and changes in your skin.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=7s)** — And I want to focus on four main heavy metals. And really it's the dose that determines the poison.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=15s)** — We are all exposed to various toxins and definitely heavy metals in certain amounts.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=19s)** — And if they are low enough, they won't affect our bodies. In fact, there is some really
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=24s)** — interesting information that you might find quite shocking.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=29s)** — Certain experiments with animals have indicated that even a deficiency of some of these heavy metals
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=35s)** — can create problems in growth and reproduction. So apparently some of these heavy metals act as
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=43s)** — essential trace minerals. Interesting. But let's just start with this thing called arsenic.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=48s)** — Now you're normally going to find arsenic in pressurized wood, maybe in the water supply,
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=55s)** — maybe in an insecticide that ends up on your food. But too much arsenic can create either a
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=61s)** — hyper or hypo pigmentation. That means that your skin can start to look a little bit darker
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=67s)** — or lighter. I'm talking about little dark spots or little white spots. And primarily you
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=74s)** — might see this on your torso, the mid part of your body. You may also notice a hard surface
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=80s)** — on the palms of your hand and the soles of your feet. This is called keratosis. And this is
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=86s)** — another indication that potentially it could be arsenic. Now just because you have these
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=91s)** — symptoms does not mean you have this problem. You have to look at the whole picture.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=95s)** — But I think it's important to understand the connection so maybe you can evaluate it deeper
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=99s)** — and see if there is a problem or not. The thing about arsenic is it depletes glutathione. And so
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=105s)** — there are certain things that you can take or make sure you have in your body in sufficient
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=112s)** — amounts to protect you against arsenic. And that would be selenium. One Brazil nut will
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=118s)** — give you a good amount of selenium. Selenium is also naturally in seafood. But selenium is one.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=125s)** — Zinc is number two. Folate, which is one of the B vitamins. And carotenoids, which is an
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=131s)** — antioxidant in a lot of vegetables. One remedy for arsenic is spirulina. That can be protective
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=138s)** — against arsenic. Now the next one I want to talk about is cadmium. Cadmium is in spray paints,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=145s)** — tobacco if you smoke cigarettes. And it's also in shellfish. If someone is exposed to
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=151s)** — much cadmium, they're going to notice a yellowing of the skin. And this is not jaundice. And
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=157s)** — sometimes a tanning of your skin when you actually have no reason to be tanned. You're also
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=164s)** — susceptible to getting skin cancer if you have too much cadmium. There's some protection
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=169s)** — against cadmium. And that is making sure you have enough zinc in your body. Zinc is going
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=174s)** — to be a common thread with all four of these heavy metals. And the best source of zinc would
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=180s)** — be red meat, shellfish, beef liver. But any of the antioxidants will help. And that's in a lot
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=187s)** — of raw vegetables and sprouts and microgreens. But also a remedy called NAC, which is a very
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=195s)** — powerful antioxidant. It's like a precursor to glutathione. Let's go to lead. Lead is in
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=200s)** — paint or it used to be in paint. It can be in our water supply. It can be in our soils.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=206s)** — But the distinct indication that you might have lead poisoning is a blue line on your gums,
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=214s)** — okay, in your mouth. It's called a lead line. Some of the things that can protect you against
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=219s)** — lead is having enough calcium in the body, having enough iron in the body, a remedy called
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=225s)** — calcium EDTA, which is like a chelator that can help pull these heavy metals out, and
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=237s)** — it's also in fish and thymirisal, which is in certain vaccines. Now the next heavy metal would
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=243s)** — be mercury. But mercury poisoning can create a graying of the skin and a very interesting
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=249s)** — pink color on your palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. The seafood or fish
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=255s)** — lowest mercury include anchovies, catfish, clam, crab, crawfish, flounder, herring, oyster,
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=264s)** — sardines, scallops. Also make sure that you have at least one Brazil nut every single day.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=270s)** — That will give you enough selenium to counter mercury toxicity. So these are just very
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=276s)** — distinct symptoms relating to heavy metal toxicity. Now there's a lot of other symptoms
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=280s)** — but I think it's just good to be aware of these four toxic metals. One thing that's really good
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=288s)** — for any type of toxicity, especially heavy metal toxicity, is to start drinking distilled
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=295s)** — water. And then adding in the minerals that you want. But distilled water acts like a
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=299s)** — vacuum and it can help pull out these heavy metals. But remember the poison is in the dose
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=305s)** — so just because you're exposed to a little bit doesn't mean anything.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=309s)** — Now if you have not seen my video on distilled water it's pretty interesting. I put it up
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVUO1LiqE8&t=313s)** — right here. Check it out.
