- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=0s)** — The number one food to remove fat from your liver. In the past, a fatty liver was mostly
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=6s)** — caused by alcohol. But nowadays, it's caused by something different. We're talking about
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=11s)** — a problem that can extend beyond the liver. Issues would be like type 2 diabetes, obesity,
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=16s)** — high blood pressure. And this leads me to the biggest confusion of this disorder.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=21s)** — The medical profession is very careful not to give you the cause-effect relationship.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=26s)** — Instead, they talk about the risk factors. They list all these things like obesity and diabetes
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=31s)** — and high blood pressure. And if you have these, you're at risk for getting this fatty liver issue.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=36s)** — This is why they're even changing the name from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to something
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=41s)** — called MASH. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatial hepatitis. Now, what does that mean?
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=47s)** — That's basically a fatty liver with inflammation. They really kind of keep things disconnected.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=51s)** — I mean, it's obvious to me what's causing it. But for the average person, it's all kind of
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=56s)** — general, kind of confusing. So basically, they're going to focus in on the smoke detector
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=59s)** — without really looking at the fire behind it. And that way, we can treat each individual risk
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=65s)** — factor with a different medication. Now, I want to show you a clip of another way that they
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=69s)** — hide the real cause. Check this out. Most of the population has had excess nutrition day
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=76s)** — after day after day. And that's what ends up causing damage to the liver and many other
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=80s)** — organs. I mean, that just sounds funny as a cause for a fatty liver. You're chronically eating too
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=86s)** — much nutrition. I mean, if I just told you right now, you know, you're suffering from chronic
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=90s)** — overnutrition, you might kind of ask me, what the heck are you talking about? Overnutrition
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=96s)** — is too much sugar, too much starch or refined carbohydrates, or too many seed oils. They're
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=101s)** — not nutritious because they don't have any nutrients. You cannot live on those foods
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=104s)** — forever without getting sick. I'm talking about the breads, pasta, cereal crackers,
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=107s)** — biscuits, waffles, pancakes, especially the industrial sugars, like the high fructose corn
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=112s)** — syrup really hammers the liver hardcore. Anytime you eat glucose, all of your cells can
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=117s)** — metabolize it, but not fructose. If we look up this disease online, it'll tell you that
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=122s)** — rarely are you going to really experience any symptom other than fatigue, sometimes
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=127s)** — right upper quadrant discomfort, which by the way, I had for over a decade, cognitive problems,
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=133s)** — you're going to notice like your skin is a bit yellow, your feet getting hot or itchy,
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=136s)** — you're definitely going to notice a gut. You have just too much fat in your liver that's spilling
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=140s)** — off into and around your organs. If you read a little bit lower on the page, when it talks
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=145s)** — about the fatty liver, there's something really interesting. In the section of diet, it'll talk
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=149s)** — about what potentially causes a fatty liver. And they mention red meat, organ meats, liver,
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=156s)** — and eggs causing a fatty liver. If you look up those studies, they are all observational
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=163s)** — studies. So in other words, they give you a food questionnaire and they say, remember what you
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=167s)** — ate in the last year, and they don't pay attention to these other variables. Like if you're
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=171s)** — eating red meat or eggs, did you eat french fries with that? Are you eating sugar with
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=176s)** — that? Are you smoking? Are you drinking alcohol with that? They're not really looking at
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=180s)** — these other factors. So these observational studies are worthless and you don't want
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=185s)** — to use those. It's the worst type of science. And when you want to manipulate things and
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=189s)** — have the media put out certain things, you're going to use these observational studies.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=194s)** — I mean, if red meat, liver, and eggs cause this fatty liver epidemic, then why did this
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=200s)** — explosion, this epidemic of a fatty liver, occur after we reduced saturated fat? Could
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=205s)** — it possibly be because we dramatically increased our refined carbohydrates? There is data to
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=212s)** — show that if you go on a low-carb ketogenic diet, you can reduce 50% of the fat off your
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=218s)** — liver within a few weeks. The question is, what should you eat? The last one is going to be
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=223s)** — the most powerful. Number one, grass-fed red meat. It's not necessarily just beef. It
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=229s)** — could be lamb as well. What's so special about that? It helps to restore your insulin
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=233s)** — problems and your blood sugar. It has high quality protein. It has zinc. It has copper.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=238s)** — Po-enzyme Q10. All of these nutrients are super healing for the liver. Number two,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=243s)** — eggs. Because out of all the nutrients that help protect you against the fatty liver,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=247s)** — that nutrient is choline. And guess what? Egg yolks are very high in choline. Egg yolks are
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=254s)** — zero carbohydrate. Anything that is zero carb is going to help reverse a fatty liver. Number
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=260s)** — three, cruciferous vegetables. Especially if it's fermented in the form of sauerkraut. That
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=266s)** — will help support the liver going through its detoxification. The fermentation part of the
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=271s)** — cabbage really will help in removing the fat from the liver. The other cruciferous vegetable
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=275s)** — I consume a lot of is arugula. It's slightly bitter. I put my extra virgin olive oil on there.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=280s)** — And I also sprinkle some nutritional yeast on there. Makes a great salad. Plus when your
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=285s)** — microbiome eats some of this fiber, it gives you all sorts of additional cool things that will
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=290s)** — help your blood sugar as well. Next food on the list is wild caught salmon or other wild
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=295s)** — caught fatty fish that have not only a lot of nutrition and protein, but they're very high
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=300s)** — omega-3 fatty acids. And what these omega-3 fatty acids do to the liver is help reduce inflammation.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=307s)** — Omega-3 fatty acid is really beneficial to help the liver in many different ways. And
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=313s)** — cod liver and cod liver oil. You talk about taking your omega-3s to the next level. You
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=318s)** — just get a lot more. Next one is broccoli sprouts. What's so special about broccoli sprouts?
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=323s)** — Well, you're dealing with a cruciferous vegetable which has sulforaphane, which does a
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=328s)** — lot. It's anti-cancer, but it's very good to detoxify the liver and decrease A1C, which will
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=334s)** — help your blood sugar. I would take the broccoli sprouts and put them on your arugula salad.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=339s)** — Let's get to the best food that you can eat for your liver. And this is going to be very
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=344s)** — surprising because it's the exact thing that they tell you not to eat for a fatty liver.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=350s)** — Grass-fed liver. Beef liver or lamb liver has the most choline. We get this low carb,
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=356s)** — high choline, high nutrient dense with most of the trace minerals like zinc, selenium. These
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=362s)** — are all really important in reducing fat and inflammation off the liver. Now, of course,
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=367s)** — if we cook that liver with the onions, garlic, with our arugula salad, with broccoli sprouts,
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=373s)** — maybe with a little sauerkraut, with egg on top of that, now you have the best meal
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAO0s8xU2w&t=377s)** — for your liver. Thanks so much for watching. I will see you in the next video.
