- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=0s)** — There's a dark side of zinc relating to your hair that we need to talk about.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=5s)** — Now since zinc is probably one of the most important trace minerals for your hair,
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=9s)** — you need to know that too much zinc can cause the same exact problem with your hair as not enough zinc.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=17s)** — So zinc being a trace mineral is involved in over 300 different enzymes relating to your immune system,
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=23s)** — testosterone, sense of smell, taste, vision, reproduction, skin health. I mean it's involved
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=31s)** — in almost every part of your immune system. But I want to touch on the relationship between zinc
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=35s)** — and your hair because a lot of people are taking way too much zinc and that could be the reason
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=41s)** — why things get worse. So the reason why you might lose your hair when you don't have enough
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=47s)** — zinc is that zinc is needed to support the growth of the hair follicle. Now what is the hair
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=55s)** — follicle? It's not the actual hair. It's the pore or shaft that the hair grows out of and
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=63s)** — it's just beneath your scalp. And so the growth of that follicle is dependent on zinc.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=69s)** — And if you don't have zinc, you're not going to have follicles for the hair to grow out of.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=74s)** — Zinc is also needed for collagen and keratin. Two types of protein
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=81s)** — that allows the hair to be strong and elastic. So if you're deficient in zinc, you're going to
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=88s)** — have thin hair and brittle hair because it's not going to be elastic. And also zinc is
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=94s)** — needed to make this enzyme ALP. I'm not going to get into the name of it. It's not important.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=99s)** — But ALP is involved in three different pathways that control the different phases of hair growth.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=107s)** — So for example, if you have one of the phases of hair being a little too short
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=110s)** — or not even existing at all because you don't have enough zinc, you're going to have hair
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=115s)** — loss just from that enzyme. And on top of that, that enzyme is also responsible for
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=121s)** — feeding the hair follicle energy so it can actually work correctly. And so as you can see,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=127s)** — zinc is really, really important. Your hair depends on it. Okay, and I'm going to talk about
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=131s)** — the amounts of zinc that you need. But let's just first talk about what happens when you get
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=136s)** — too much zinc and what those numbers are. When you get too much zinc, you actually create
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=141s)** — a copper deficiency in the body because zinc and copper work together like a teeter-totter,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=147s)** — just like in calcium and magnesium. But the more zinc that you take, the more copper you're
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=152s)** — going to need. And if you're taking zinc without copper, that's when you can create problems.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=159s)** — But copper itself is involved in hair growth as well. Copper maintains the color of your hair.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=165s)** — So if you have to color your hair very often, chances are you could be missing copper.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=170s)** — Copper also helps the structural integrity of the hair. And so this could actually show up
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=174s)** — as a thinning hair, brittle hair, or even hair loss. Copper is the co-factor or helper molecule
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=183s)** — in different enzymes that relate to the growth of hair as well as the maintenance of your hair.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=188s)** — So copper will help prevent the hair loss, prevent hair thinning, and it will support
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=193s)** — the follicle, that shaft of the hair. So when you think of zinc toxicity, think of a copper
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=199s)** — So here's the important part. The upper tolerance, the amount of zinc that you can take without any
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=207s)** — side effects, is roughly about 40 milligrams per day. And this is for adults. And you're not
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=213s)** — going to have any bad effects from that. And just so you know, the bad effects would be
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=217s)** — feeling nauseous, you might have vomiting, decreased appetite, abdominal cramps, diarrhea,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=222s)** — and headaches. But here's the thing you need to know. In certain circumstances, you need to take
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=228s)** — high amounts of zinc. Like if you have an autoimmune disease, or you get an infection,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=236s)** — or you have inflammation of the gut, which prevents the absorption of zinc. Because most of
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=240s)** — the absorption happens in the small intestine. And just so you know, when you eat food that's
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=245s)** — high in zinc, like whether you're eating oysters, any meats, shellfish, seaweed, or cheese,
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=251s)** — you only absorb 20 to 40 percent of the zinc from those foods. But if you have inflammation
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=259s)** — in your gut, it's going to be less than that. Now on top of that, there's other things that
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=264s)** — decrease the absorption of zinc. Like stress, like a high carb diet, like phytic acid. Now
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=272s)** — what is phytic acid? That's an anti-nutrient in grains that prevents the absorption of zinc
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=278s)** — and other minerals. And then another thing is if you're estrogen dominant, let's say you're taking
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=282s)** — birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy, estrogen or progesterone, you can block the
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=288s)** — absorption of zinc. And then you also have your stomach acid. If your stomach acid is not strong
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=293s)** — enough, you're not going to absorb zinc. So in those situations, you have to take more. And in
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=298s)** — some videos, I even recommend taking 200 or even 250 milligrams of zinc short term to overcome
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=306s)** — a certain health problem, whether it's autoimmune or inflammation or whatever. But the key is
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=313s)** — making sure you take enough copper to prevent any side effects at all. And so roughly the
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=320s)** — ratio of zinc to copper that I would recommend is like 10 to 1. 10 times more zinc than
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=327s)** — copper. So let's say, for example, you don't have an autoimmune disease, you're not going
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=331s)** — through an infection, you don't have any problems with your small intestine. I would
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=335s)** — take the upper limit dose of 40 milligrams of zinc per day, and then I would roughly take like
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=342s)** — one milligram of copper. Now, these numbers are arbitrary, they're not exact, so it can be around
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=348s)** — that. But generally speaking, if you do like a 10 to 1 ratio of zinc to copper, you're not
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=354s)** — going to experience symptoms. But some people actually like to start off small and just do like
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=359s)** — 10 milligrams of zinc and maybe see how that does maybe work up. But so many people are
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=365s)** — deficient in zinc. 1.1 billion people on this planet are deficient in zinc. And what the body
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=371s)** — will do, it'll allocate that zinc to the most important functions of the body, and not to
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=379s)** — everything. So the body tends to ration out or use the zinc in the most important parts.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=384s)** — That would probably be related to reproduction, sperm count, things like that. But your hair
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=390s)** — probably is not at the top of the list for survival as a priority. I mean, you can survive
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=395s)** — without your hair just fine. But as a species, we can't survive without reproducing. So you
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=400s)** — have a couple options with zinc. Make sure that you're avoiding things that prevent the
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=405s)** — absorption. But also you might want to be taking some zinc. In addition to that, eating
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBw0va7ut8c&t=410s)** — foods high in zinc. Now, there's a lot more to know about zinc. It's a fascinating mineral.
