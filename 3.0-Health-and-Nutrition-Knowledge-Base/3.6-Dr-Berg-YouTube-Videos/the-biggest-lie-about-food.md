- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=0s)** — Today I'd like to discuss the myth around metabolic syndrome. They call it syndrome X.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=7s)** — And that's a combination of several conditions. Central abdominal fat, blood pressure, glucose
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=14s)** — levels are starting to go up. We have high triglycerides with insulin resistance for sure.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=19s)** — And also we have higher levels of insulin in the blood. It's called hyperinsulinemia,
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=24s)** — an association with an increased amount of uric acid. We automatically associate
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=29s)** — metabolic syndrome with something really, really bad. It's a disease that you get and doctors are
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=33s)** — going to put you a lot of medications. There's going to be a lot of testing and it's very
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=37s)** — complex and no one really knows what causes it. But today I'm going to give you a completely
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=41s)** — new viewpoint on metabolic syndrome as it relates to a type of sugar called fructose.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=50s)** — Now what I believe metabolic syndrome really is, it's a protective mechanism. Now if we
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=59s)** — humans did eat fruit and they did eat honey, not very often, which has a really good amount of
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=67s)** — fructose. So I want to just talk about fructose for a second. It's a unique type of sugar.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=73s)** — And when you consume glucose, there's receptors all over your body that can metabolize glucose.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=79s)** — But fructose is different. The liver is really the only place where your body can metabolize
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=84s)** — And there's some very unique things about fructose that relate to this topic that I'm going to talk
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=90s)** — about. Number one, it's a lot more lipogenic, which means that it produces more fat than other
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=97s)** — types of sugar. Also fructose enhances the fat genes much more than glucose and other sugars.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=104s)** — If you just think about fructose for a minute and what would be the survival benefit of
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=110s)** — consuming some fructose? You know infrequently in the past, as we're trying to survive in our
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=116s)** — environment, food did not come very easily and anytime that you had some fruit or honey,
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=123s)** — it was a survival thing. And so this really aligns with what fructose does in the body.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=128s)** — Number one, it retains sodium. Now what would be the survival mechanism for that? Well way
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=135s)** — back in time we did not have a lot of salt available in our diets. We had animal meat,
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=142s)** — there were some plants, we pretty much ate anything we could. And apparently if we look at
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=147s)** — some interesting differences between way back then and now, we ate a lot less salt back
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=153s)** — then or sodium because it just wasn't available. And so sodium does help retain fluid and water
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=159s)** — and prevents dehydration. And so one thing that fructose does is it helps you retain
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=165s)** — sodium and sodium chloride salt which connects to sodium. So way back then when we had fruit and
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=170s)** — honey, we could retain more fluid and prevent dehydration. In fact fructose stimulates this
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=175s)** — hormone called vasopressin which is called the anti-diuretic hormone. So it prevents the
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=181s)** — loss of fluid from the body. It helps you retain fluid. So this is a survival mechanism.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=186s)** — Now if we take a look at what else we did way back then compared to now, we consumed a
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=190s)** — potassium from just vegetation, plants, things like that. Compared to now, the average person
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=198s)** — consumes about one and a half cups of vegetables. So that doesn't give us much potassium. So
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=204s)** — nowadays we have a lot of sodium and very low amounts of potassium. Very different from
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=211s)** — in the past. Another interesting thing about fructose is it causes sodium sensitivity. What's
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=219s)** — the advantage of that survival wise? Well if you can make sodium more sensitive, you can absorb
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=224s)** — it more. It goes in your body. It can be retained more. And another benefit of holding this
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=230s)** — sodium is to help you increase blood pressure. Because one of the really important things in
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=235s)** — the past was you don't want to end up with low blood pressure because you don't have enough
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=239s)** — sodium. Because we need to maintain the same amount of pressure to push the nutrients and
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=244s)** — oxygen throughout our body, including our brain. Next thing is abdominal obesity. What would be the
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=250s)** — survival mechanism of that? Well we're storing fuel for another day. That's what fat is. It's
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=256s)** — a survival mechanism and we have a lot of extra space in our bellies. It's almost an
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=262s)** — unlimited amount of space. Well it's not completely unlimited, but you can store a
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=266s)** — tremendous amount of stored energy in your midsection. So that would be a survival mechanism
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=270s)** — during lean times. Now of course nowadays we consume a bit more fructose than we did in the
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=277s)** — past. I mean fruits are available 24-7 every day of the year. Honey is also available.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=284s)** — And also other types of fructose in the form of high fructose corn syrup. We're actually
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=288s)** — drinking our fructose now. I mean even table sugar is like 50 percent fructose. So fructose is
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=295s)** — pretty much everywhere. Now what about this other thing with insulin resistance? Is there
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=300s)** — any survival mechanism with that? There sure is. Number one, insulin resistance helps protect
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=306s)** — against the toxicity of glucose because it makes receptors for insulin very resistant.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=312s)** — So you can't absorb as much glucose into the cell because if there's too much glucose that's
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=318s)** — going to be toxic and it's a way to protect you against both glucose and insulin. And along
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=324s)** — with insulin resistance, there's another thing that happens that helps you survive. And that's
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=331s)** — gluconeogenesis. That's the production of new sugar that doesn't involve a carbohydrate. So when
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=336s)** — people are a pre-diabetic and they have insulin resistance, they actually make more glucose.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=344s)** — But it's not coming from the diet. Their liver is just making more glucose from other sources.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=349s)** — And this is behind the dawn phenomena. This is where you wake up in the morning and all of a
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=353s)** — sudden you have high blood glucose. But maybe you didn't have any glucose tonight before.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=356s)** — It just means that you have insulin resistance and the liver makes more glucose because of it.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=364s)** — And this is what you see in diabetes as well. You have a diabetic with high blood glucose.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=369s)** — A certain portion of that is not coming from the sugar they're eating. It's coming from
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=374s)** — the liver producing a lot of sugar. What is the survival mechanism of gluconeogenesis?
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=379s)** — Well, number one, it helps you protect against hypoglycemia because your brain depends
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=386s)** — partially on glucose which can be made by your body. And in times when there's not a
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=392s)** — lot of glucose available, this extra added gluconeogenesis can help the brain during
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=397s)** — survival modes. But of course nowadays it's gotten out of control because we're having
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=402s)** — way too much sugar and we have way too much gluconeogenesis. Now the next point I want
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=406s)** — to bring up is uric acid. You probably already know that when you consume fructose,
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=413s)** — you spike your uric acid. Now what is the connection survival-wise with uric acid? Well,
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=419s)** — number one, it's a potent antioxidant. So from that viewpoint, it protects you against
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=426s)** — oxidation. Oxidation of what? Well, fructose which is a type of sugar that oxidizes the
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=434s)** — insulin arteries and it creates a lot of damage unless there's some protective factors
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=439s)** — that are connected to it, one being uric acid. But uric acid is a good predictor of high blood
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=447s)** — pressure and heart disease. So uric acid tends to increase blood pressure. What's the survival
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=452s)** — mechanism of that? Well, like I said before, when you don't have enough sodium, we're
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=458s)** — going to end up with low blood pressure and that is not a good survival mix. So the uric
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=465s)** — acid comes in there to help increase the blood pressure under conditions of low sodium.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=474s)** — So in the past, uric acid was one way to raise the blood pressure. Of course, nowadays,
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=480s)** — when you have a lot of fructose and a lot of salt, that creates a huge problem with uric
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=485s)** — acid. Very pathogenic. Uric acid also directly makes salt more sensitive. Nowadays, when
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=492s)** — we're all so sensitive, we tell people to restrict their salt. But what they really
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=496s)** — should do is restrict their fructose and increase that other mineral that I mentioned
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=501s)** — called potassium. Potassium is something that our body has evolved with way back in the past.
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=508s)** — We used to eat a lot more of it than we do now. And so as long as you have higher
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=512s)** — amounts of potassium, you can handle a lot more sodium. And it just happens that more
- **[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=519s)** — potassium lowers blood pressure very, very nicely. So when we talk about blood pressure,
- **[08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=527s)** — we're not necessarily avoiding fructose. What do we do? We avoid salt diets. So very simply,
- **[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=533s)** — just understanding these mechanisms, you can very easily control your blood pressure by
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=538s)** — increasing potassium, getting rid of the sugars, especially fructose. And as far as
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=545s)** — as long as you have enough potassium, you have like a two to one ratio, twice as much potassium
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=551s)** — to sodium, you're going to be totally fine. Another thing about uric acid, it's involved with
- **[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=557s)** — the immune inflammation reaction as it can help fight off infections, things like that. In the
- **[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=564s)** — past, we used that as a survival mechanism. Nowadays, if we have too much uric acid,
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=569s)** — we get inflammation throughout our bodies, especially in the big toe, and that's called
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=573s)** — another really interesting survival thing is just the storage of fat and the storage of glucose
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=580s)** — as glycogen. Glycogen is stored glucose. What's interesting about this as it relates to water
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=589s)** — in times of survival, when we didn't have enough water, believe it or not, as we burned
- **[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=594s)** — our fat, glycogen can make water. In fact, just a little over one gram, like 1.1 gram of
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=600s)** — when it's burned produces one gram of water, which is interesting. That's going to be a survival
- **[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=606s)** — mechanism to help against dehydration, but also glycogen. If you envision these
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=614s)** — string of glucose molecules connected together, they're connected together with a lot of water.
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=620s)** — For every one gram of glucose that you burn, you release 3.5 grams of water. You're
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=629s)** — releasing a lot of available water when you burn up this glucose as glycogen. Now, in the past,
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=636s)** — when we consumed fructose, it always came with a bunch of antioxidants because we ate fruit.
- **[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=644s)** — And of course, the fruit wasn't as sweet as it is now, but fruit generally has antioxidants,
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=650s)** — and antioxidants protect against the oxidative damage of the fructose. It gets rid of the
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=656s)** — complications of just high sugar. This is why a diabetic will have much less problems if they
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=663s)** — actually also have the antioxidants connected with that sugar versus the refined sugars where
- **[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=669s)** — you're just doing high fructose corn syrup and you're drinking it. Related to antioxidants,
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=674s)** — I'm going to just touch on vitamin C, which is interesting. Vitamin C has a
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=678s)** — very similar chemistry to both glucose and fructose. And so the more glucose and fructose
- **[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=686s)** — you consume, the more vitamin C is required. One is it helps protect the immune system.
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=692s)** — Another is it helps to get rid of oxidative damage from the high glucose. Vitamin C can
- **[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=698s)** — even inhibit the burning of fat as well. So it can actually help you survive because it slows
- **[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=705s)** — down to a certain degree, fat oxidation or fat burning. Now what I'm not saying is avoiding
- **[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=710s)** — vitamin C because it's going to help you lose weight. That's not how it works. The point
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=714s)** — I'm making is the vitamin C in the fruit is protective against that fructose. So when you
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=721s)** — study metabolic syndrome and you look at what they say is the cause, they said overeating.
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=727s)** — It could be obesity, stress, a lack of exercise, age. And when you really understand
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=733s)** — this, you're going to be less susceptible to just going, oh, let's just treat each part of this
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=737s)** — with a different drug, which makes no sense whatsoever. So if you have problems with sodium,
- **[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=743s)** — if you have problems with your midsection, if you have problems with high blood pressure,
- **[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=748s)** — if you have problems with uric acid, fructose is what you need to avoid and in all forms
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbKqWWHE-zw&t=754s)** — as well. Now if you want a complete diet to know exactly what to eat, to reverse a lot of
