- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=0s)** — You know, the worst thing you could do to a person is take away their peanuts.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=3s)** — Okay, and I'm not going to do that.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=5s)** — I'm just going to talk about what type of peanuts you should focus more on.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=9s)** — Because if you end up buying the wrong type of peanuts or peanut butter,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=13s)** — you may find that your health is going to suffer.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=16s)** — There's this one ingredient in 80% of all peanut butter you don't want in your body.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=22s)** — And if you eat the right type of peanut butter or peanuts,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=25s)** — I don't think there's going to be a lot of health issues.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=28s)** — But I recently started the carnivore diet just to test it out for a couple of weeks.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=32s)** — From the elimination of the nuts, my bloating went away.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=36s)** — So I'm not going back to peanuts. You can if it doesn't bloat you.
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=41s)** — But I have also gone back to vegetables as well.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=44s)** — So my diet right now is a combination.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=46s)** — It's like 50% carnivore and 50% plant-based because I do like my salads.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=51s)** — But let's talk about the difference between conventional peanut butter or peanuts.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=55s)** — Now when you're consuming conventional peanuts,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=59s)** — unfortunately peanuts are probably one of the most heavily sprayed with pesticides and insecticides
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=65s)** — and especially fungicides out of many different things that you might eat.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=70s)** — A peanut is not an actual nut. It's a legume.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=73s)** — And so when they spray, it gets into soil and it gets down into where the peanut is.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=78s)** — And this peanut shell is very, very thin.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=80s)** — Unlike a walnut, which has a hard shell, you really need to do organic peanuts or peanut butter.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=87s)** — Okay, that's number one.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=88s)** — There's also an herbicide called glyphosate, which can act like an antibiotic.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=93s)** — It's in a lot of different GMO foods.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=95s)** — And that's been known to be in peanuts simply because they rotate the crops from a GMO food to a peanut back and forth.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=102s)** — I think it's cottonseed or it could be canola.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=105s)** — I'm not 100% sure.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=106s)** — The other thing is you must read the label because if it says hydrogenated anything, don't consume that.
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=115s)** — Now, you maybe have heard of partially hydrogenated, which gave you all these trans fats.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=120s)** — Well, what's the difference between hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated?
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=124s)** — Really, I think from my own viewpoint, it's very, very similar.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=127s)** — Even though they say that hydrogenate doesn't have the trans fats,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=130s)** — you're basically using the same process of adding hydrogens under high heat and then it becomes partially hydrogenated.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=138s)** — And then they leave it in longer and then becomes fully hydrogenated.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=142s)** — And so you want to avoid anything that says hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=146s)** — Also, they sneak in vegetable oils, which are not vegetables.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=151s)** — They're seed oils.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=152s)** — They put this in the peanut butter.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=155s)** — So you just don't want to even have that in your body.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=157s)** — The other thing that slips in there is this sugar.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=160s)** — Sometimes family members will buy peanut butter, right?
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=162s)** — And I'll start consuming it on something.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=164s)** — I'm like, wow, this is really good.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=165s)** — And I'm like, oh, let me read the label.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=168s)** — This is why it's so good because it has sugar in it.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=170s)** — But there's one more ingredient that's a carcinogen.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=173s)** — It can increase the risk of certain cancers by 46 percent.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=177s)** — And that ingredient is monoglycerides.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=181s)** — There's a French study that links it to cancer.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=185s)** — So we don't want that in our diets.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=187s)** — And they use it just to kind of break things up.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=189s)** — So you don't have that layer of oil at the top.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=191s)** — So if you find a peanut butter that has all of those factors,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=195s)** — I would upgrade to a better quality peanut butter.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=198s)** — Okay, peanuts and salt. Pretty natural.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=201s)** — If we want to improve it more, we want organic peanuts and sea salt.
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=205s)** — If we want to improve it even a little bit more,
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=207s)** — I would recommend Valencia organic peanuts.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=211s)** — They're the ones that have the least amount of potential aflatoxin,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=215s)** — which is a toxin from certain molds that can grow on peanuts,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=220s)** — which is very, very damaging to the liver.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=223s)** — And they use sea salt, which is better than regular table salt.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=226s)** — Sometimes it's really hard to not overdo it with peanuts or peanut butter.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=230s)** — I know if I sit down and start eating peanuts,
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=232s)** — I will pretty much eat the whole bag.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=234s)** — And I can feel this like heavy feeling underneath my rib cage.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=238s)** — That's my gallbladder trying to digest these fats.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=242s)** — One more point about peanuts and peanut butter.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=244s)** — If you can have them with the meal, that's better than a snack,
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=248s)** — especially if you're snacking late at night,
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=250s)** — because anything that you consume of any significance as far as calories
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=254s)** — can spike the insulin.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=256s)** — And if you're into intermittent fasting,
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=259s)** — nuts are a dangerous item to have around, especially late at night.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=264s)** — Now, since we're on the topic of nuts,
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=265s)** — if you have not seen my video on walnuts,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=268s)** — you might want to check that out.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2JcmyEoKos&t=270s)** — I put it up right here.
