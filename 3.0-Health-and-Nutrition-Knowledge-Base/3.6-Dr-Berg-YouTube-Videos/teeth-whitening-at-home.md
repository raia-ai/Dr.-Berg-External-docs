- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=0s)** — I'm going to show you how to use just two ingredients to whiten your teeth at home.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=4s)** — You don't need to go to the dentist and do this very expensive procedure.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=8s)** — You also don't even need to buy those whitening strips.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=11s)** — This remedy is going to cost you about three dollars and it's super effective.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=15s)** — If your teeth are a bit stained like yellow from coffee, tea, red wine,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=19s)** — or just getting older, this will be a great solution.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=22s)** — After the recipe, I'm going to also talk about oil pulling and also some fascinating
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=26s)** — information about leaky gums. You can actually have a situation where you're getting bacteria
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=31s)** — that goes into your gums, into your bloodstream. So that's going to be very important to learn
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=35s)** — about that. If you want to make your teeth super white, there's two things you need to have.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=40s)** — Number one, you need baking soda. I found baking soda at the store for a dollar seventy-nine.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=46s)** — This will add a certain texture to this paste to allow you to scrub your teeth and help remove
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=52s)** — the stain as well as plaque. It's gentle. It's non-abrasive. Number two, you're going
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=56s)** — to need something called hydrogen peroxide. I recently found some for a dollar sixty for an
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=61s)** — entire bottle. Now, it's very important that you don't get the wrong hydrogen peroxide.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=65s)** — You want the one that says three percent or less. You do not want the one that's like
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=71s)** — fifteen percent or forty percent. That's going to be way too strong. And by the way,
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=75s)** — the main ingredient in these whitening strips that you'd buy online is hydrogen peroxide,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=81s)** — but they charge you like twenty, thirty, forty dollars for these little strips. You don't
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=85s)** — need to do that. Then when you go to dentists, it's even more expensive and they're using a
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=89s)** — very concentrated hydrogen peroxide, which is up into the forties. The problem with that is,
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=94s)** — yes, it does work on making your teeth whiter, but that super high concentrated hydrogen
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=99s)** — peroxide on your gums with the ultraviolet or LED lights that they put at the same time
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=105s)** — that intensifies that chemical reaction can really mess with your gums and dehydrate your
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=112s)** — teeth to the point where now you have this sensation in your teeth that they hurt because
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=116s)** — the concentration is too high. Yes, it'll work a little faster, but you don't want to put that
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=122s)** — in your mouth. Here's what you're going to do. Get a little container and you're going to
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=125s)** — put one teaspoon of baking soda in the container. Then you're going to take the hydrogen
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=129s)** — peroxide three percent or less, and you're only going to use three drops of it into
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=134s)** — this baking soda. And then eight drops of water. You're going to mix it up really nice,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=139s)** — and it's going to actually break up the bonds of the stain. The stain is a certain chain of
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=146s)** — molecules. Well, the oxygen will break that up and release this pigment from your teeth,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=152s)** — causing you to have whiter teeth. This is why hydrogen peroxide is so important. Then you're
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=156s)** — going to mix it up. Take your toothbrush and gently polish the outside of your teeth,
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=161s)** — the inside of your teeth. This is also going to help any bacteria that you have as well.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=165s)** — It's also going to reduce the plaque formation. You're basically going to brush your teeth with
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=170s)** — this mixture for one to two minutes. Then you're going to rinse out your mouth very
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=175s)** — thoroughly. But because the concentration is less than the 40 percent that you would see
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=180s)** — when you go to the dentist, you're going to have to do this a few times a week. I would
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=183s)** — recommend doing it two to three times a week for a few weeks to see the big change. But it's
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=188s)** — going to work. You will be amazed. And I do want you to comment down below when you see the
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=193s)** — The whole point of this is to do it safely and gradually. This way you won't damage your gums
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=199s)** — or the enamel on your teeth. That was simple. Now let's talk about oil poling.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=203s)** — You probably have heard this on the internet where people are taking coconut oil and they
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=208s)** — put it in their mouth and they kind of swish it around for a period of time. Right? What is
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=212s)** — that doing? What is that all about? This is actually an ancient practice. And they didn't
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=217s)** — just use coconut oil back then. They used sesame seed oil. So you can do that too. But
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=222s)** — less bitter and it's more of a pleasant taste. And it will work because what you're going to do
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=226s)** — is you're going to take some coconut oil and you're going to keep it in there for 10 to 20
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=231s)** — minutes. You're just going to keep swishing it around your mouth. Coconut oil is very high in
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=235s)** — something called lauric acid, which is a very powerful antimicrobial for bacteria, fungus,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=243s)** — candida, and especially the microbe in your mouth that causes bad breath. And there was even
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=248s)** — a study in the Indian Journal of Dental Research showing this procedure as effective as prescription
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=255s)** — mouthwash in reducing gingivitis. Most people do it like three times a week. I want to talk
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=261s)** — about something even more interesting. The relationship between sugar or glucose and
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=266s)** — vitamin C. What I wanted to reveal about this is that glucose has a similar chemistry
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=273s)** — to vitamin C. They compete together. You've probably heard of scurvy before. Scurvy is a
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=279s)** — disease that happened to sailors and other people way back in the day where they basically
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=285s)** — did not have enough vitamin C. At that time it wasn't even recognized. One thing the vitamin
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=288s)** — C does is support your collagen. When you're really deficient in vitamin C, you can get
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=293s)** — pink toothbrush because your gums will bleed if you consume a lot of sugar or chew gum a
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=298s)** — lot. The vitamin C that you're taking or from the foods, the glucose will block the vitamin C
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=304s)** — from going in. Sugar depletes vitamin C from the body. It'll definitely show up as one of
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=310s)** — the first signs in the gums. You know, you're flossing your teeth and all of a sudden it
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=313s)** — bleeds easily. That's an early sign. The cells in the tissue of your gums are no longer
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=318s)** — like tight. They're kind of loose. So you have these holes very similar to having leaky
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=323s)** — gut or even leakiness in your arteries. That would make a pathogen enter that area
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=328s)** — and get into the body into the bloodstream. I don't know if you know this fact,
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=332s)** — but they've isolated dental bacteria in the placking of arteries and also in the placking
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=340s)** — in the brain and Alzheimer's. We want to keep the bacteria from going into the body
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8kPjMd8akI&t=345s)** — through the mouth. Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.
