- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=0s)** — Today you are going to learn an instant plantar fasciitis fix. When I was in practice, I would
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=4s)** — teach people how to do this. And within seconds, the pain goes away. There are three things
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=8s)** — to do. The first one will get rid of the pain instantly. The second and the third
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=11s)** — thing are more permanent fixes for your plantar fasciitis so it doesn't come back.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=17s)** — And you are definitely not going to have to use things like this to stand down
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=20s)** — with your arch, to help form the arch. That doesn't work. If your bottom of your
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=24s)** — foot is inflamed, you don't want to stretch it. The worst thing you can do is to stretch
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=29s)** — the calf or massage the bottom of the foot. That will never work. That makes it worse
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=34s)** — because you are going to be tearing things. This is what you are going to do. And I want
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=36s)** — you to do this right now while you are watching this video. First thing is to rate on a
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=40s)** — scale from 0 to 10 how bad your pain is. 10 being very severe, 0 being no pain
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=45s)** — at all. And I am talking when you put pressure on it. Now that you have that
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=48s)** — number, we are going to re-rate it after we do this very simple technique. The first
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=51s)** — step is to sit down somewhere where you can cross your leg and you are going to
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=56s)** — bend them downward. We are not stretching the calf. We are stretching the opposite
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=62s)** — muscles on the front part of your leg. You can do the other side. We are stretching
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=67s)** — down this way. I mean you can do it up to 20 times. This is difficult for you.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=71s)** — You could just go ahead and get on your couch or your bed and sit and let your
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=77s)** — butt sit on the heels and press down. If you can do this. If you can't, you
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=81s)** — can put a pillow between your butt and your legs. But you want to stretch this.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=85s)** — And do it as much as you can tolerate. It should not hurt. You are stretching the
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=89s)** — opposite muscle and fascia. And that is sending a signal to the bottom part of
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=93s)** — the foot telling the nerve signals to turn off. Now what I want you to do is
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=98s)** — re-rate the pain in your foot. You can go ahead and stand on it. That is
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=101s)** — step number one. The second thing I am going to recommend is go on the
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=104s)** — low carb diet where you are doing intermittent fasting. Two meals, no snacks.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=110s)** — I have done a million videos on this. I will put one down below because the
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=114s)** — inflammation occurs when your carbs are too high. Now let's go to the big one,
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=117s)** — number three. And the first thing to know about plantar fasciitis is that the
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=122s)** — root cause for this is too much calcium that is not really doing the right
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=126s)** — thing. How do we deal with excess calcium? Number one, magnesium.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=131s)** — Magnesium is the master controller over calcium in the body. One of the
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=136s)** — first places a magnesium deficiency will show up is in your feet. Either as a
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=144s)** — Why does it show up in the foot first? It is the most peripheral part of your body.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=149s)** — A person will tend to show up the deficiencies in the areas of the
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=152s)** — tissue which are the farthest from the heart because it is the last place
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=156s)** — to get nutrition. Calcium has everything to do with contracting a muscle.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=161s)** — When we did that stretch, what were we doing? We were trying to shorten
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=165s)** — some of the muscles and ligaments underneath the foot because they are
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=168s)** — too contracted. We are basically bypassing your body and getting it to
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=172s)** — relax at least temporarily. Magnesium deficiency is extremely common.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=177s)** — One percent of all of your magnesium is inside the blood. If you test the
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=180s)** — blood, you are not going to really know what is going on deeper in the cells.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=184s)** — The type of magnesium I would recommend is magnesium glycinate because it gets
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=187s)** — absorbed 80% versus magnesium oxide which you will only absorb 3-4%
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=193s)** — and it can give you diarrhea. You need to take at least 400 milligrams of
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=198s)** — magnesium glycinate every single day. The other piece of the puzzle is
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=202s)** — It helps with all sorts of different issues related to calcium.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=206s)** — Vitamin D hands down is the most potent anti-inflammatory that you can
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=210s)** — take and it doesn't have any side effects. You are going to need to take
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=213s)** — 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3 every single day. Realize that 20,000 IUs
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=219s)** — of vitamin D3 is equivalent to being out in the summer sun for about
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=223s)** — 40 minutes. It is not a tremendous amount but it is enough to give your
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=226s)** — body the anti-inflammatory effect. Vitamin D has a function of
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=229s)** — remodeling tissue. It can help rebuild tissue back to the normal form
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=235s)** — but only if you take enough. And on top of all that, magnesium won't
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=240s)** — work without vitamin D. And vitamin D won't work without magnesium.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=245s)** — If you take too much of one of them without the other, it creates
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=249s)** — a deficiency of the other. Taking a lot of vitamin D without magnesium,
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=253s)** — you will end up with a magnesium deficiency. The other thing about
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=261s)** — 2700 genes. This goes way beyond just plantar fasciitis. If you are
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=265s)** — deficient in vitamin D, you are going to notice it in a lot of other
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=267s)** — places too. The lower back, your immune system, but also you are
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=271s)** — going to feel achiness in your muscles and achiness in the
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=275s)** — bottom of your foot. Try to make sure that you have enough magnesium
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=278s)** — so you can actually create more relaxation versus the contraction of
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=282s)** — the bottom of your foot. When you get a vitamin D, make sure it
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=285s)** — comes with K2. Vitamin K2 also helps remove calcium from the
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=290s)** — soft tissues. It's another piece of the puzzle that you need to
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=292s)** — know about, but you can get a vitamin D that already comes with
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=295s)** — K2. You get the vitamin D3 with K2 and the magnesium. Those
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=299s)** — together will be dynamite in helping you get rid of this pain
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=302s)** — long term. Several years ago, I did this video and I want to
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=305s)** — read you just a few of the comments after people have tried
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=311s)** — this technique. Well, I just went from having left foot paint
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=314s)** — over a month. I'm a nurse and I did these stretches and my pain
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=318s)** — went from a six to a zero. Insane. This is a miracle. Next
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=323s)** — one. Eight months of limping around, cortisone injections,
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=326s)** — orthotics, walking boot, ice, stretching the wrong way, night
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=330s)** — brace, even a handicapped parking place. After the first
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=334s)** — stretch, I went from a nine to a three. You are a godsend.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=337s)** — Thank you. Check this one out. I feel like crying. I've been
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=340s)** — in so much pain, just getting worse doing other
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=343s)** — stretching exercises. I feel like a new woman. Thank you.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=346s)** — Check this out. I was probably rolling my eyes when I
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=349s)** — initially began the exercise. I did not believe a word until
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=352s)** — I realized I wasn't in pain. I cautiously stood up, put a
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=356s)** — little pressure on my right foot. I'll say 80% reduction
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=359s)** — in pain after the first set of exercises. You have my
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=363s)** — heartfelt gratitude. I will be sharing your videos so
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=366s)** — others can get the same relief as well. Thank you.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=368s)** — Check out this last one. I've been in pain for two
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=371s)** — years. I went to PT, foot doctor, chiropractor, invested
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=374s)** — in shoes with arches, and you gave me better advice than
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=378s)** — all of them combined. My husband and I did your
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=381s)** — stretches and were in utter shock amazement. We were both
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=384s)** — at a nine for pain and now it's nothing. I wish I
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=388s)** — found you a long ago. You are a blessing from God. And
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=391s)** — I've watched many other videos of yours and learning a
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=394s)** — lot. I love sugar, but you taught me it's a demon. Love
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=398s)** — you, Dr. Berg. You saved me in more and I can't read the
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=401s)** — rest of the comment. Amazing. Do these stretches
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=405s)** — several times a day, every day, until the pain is gone.
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=407s)** — And of course, the vitamin D and the magnesium and the
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=410s)** — K2 will greatly take you to the next level, especially
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=412s)** — if you do the low carb diet with intermittent fasting.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=415s)** — Please comment below and tell me how it worked for you.
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_-7966jgAQ&t=418s)** — Spread this video far and wide.
