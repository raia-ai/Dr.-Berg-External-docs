- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=0s)** — Today I want to talk about the best remedy for dry, wrinkled hands, as well as skin in general.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=6s)** — Well, I recently found some updated information on this that I want to share with you that I think
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=10s)** — you'll be quite excited about. People use these moisturizers and they keep putting them on their
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=15s)** — hands and their face. And of course, the next day the effect is gone. They have to keep doing
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=20s)** — it over and over and over. If you look at the labels and read the ingredients in most of
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=26s)** — moisturizers, they nearly all have alcohol. Alcohol dries and dehydrates your skin. And I don't think
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=33s)** — people realize that when they put lotion to the hands or on their face, it gets absorbed. It goes
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=39s)** — into the bloodstream and then it ends up in your liver. There are a lot of different things
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=43s)** — you can use that are natural. Vitamin E, you can use various like coconut oil, you can use
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=50s)** — but what I want to talk about today is something a little different. It's called
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=55s)** — hyaluronic acid. A lot of your cells, if not all of your cells, make this very specific
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=60s)** — compound. And hyaluronic acid is not just in your skin, it's in your joints. It helps hold
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=68s)** — a thousand times its weight in water. Now, as far as it relating to your skin, if you kind
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=74s)** — of envision having this body size wetsuit, that's what it would look like. It's a very thin layer
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=79s)** — and it's in the deep layer of your skin. It keeps your skin looking youthful. It's also
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=86s)** — involved in wound repair and also repair after sunburn. It actually increases if you have
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=92s)** — enough vitamin A. And this could be why when someone's deficient in vitamin A, they get
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=98s)** — dry eyes, for example, or even dry skin. But even the fluid inside your eye has a lot of
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=105s)** — hyaluronic acid. So what people don't realize is as they age, especially when they start to get
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=111s)** — 40, 45, 50 years old, it starts to go down and down and down and down to the point
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=116s)** — where you're 80 years old, you've lost 80% of your hyaluronic acid. I don't know if you've
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=122s)** — heard of the disease called progeria. Kids with progeria lose 20 times as much hyaluronic acid
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=130s)** — as someone who doesn't have that disease. So you can see in this image of someone with
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=135s)** — young youthful skin, then if you compare that to someone that has older skin, you can see it
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=140s)** — kind of is wrinkled and it's missing something. Hyaluronic acid. Now there's certain
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=145s)** — clinics that you can go to to get this substance injected into the skin. People apply
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=149s)** — it topically. Some people take it orally. That's what I'm going to talk about today.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=155s)** — Some people will tell you that it cannot be absorbed if you consume it. That's absolutely
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=160s)** — not true. You don't absorb a lot of it, but you do absorb some of it, like 2.5% of it.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=166s)** — And that can be just enough to replace what you're losing as you age. Now, Connie Chung
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=172s)** — did this whole show on hyaluronic acid and she interviewed people in Japan because in a
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=178s)** — village you had 100 year old people that were still working. And apparently it was attributed
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=184s)** — to a certain root that they were consuming that was very high in hyaluronic acid.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=191s)** — Let's say you're 45 years old. You might have between like 14 to 15 grams of this
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=197s)** — hyaluronic acid in your body. By the time you reach 80 years old, you might only have
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=203s)** — like 3.6 grams. So based on that data, it might be a good idea to start taking it as a
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=209s)** — supplement. Now, one thing I would caution you on, you don't want to do what a friend of mine
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=215s)** — did. He had this idea that he was going to take high doses. Okay, so he took, I think it
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=221s)** — was like three or four thousand milligrams of this stuff per day. You don't want to do that
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=228s)** — because it swells up in your body. Remember it holds water, right? So he took way too much
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=235s)** — and he started having some serious problems and he basically found he had to drink actually
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=241s)** — straight brandy to help dissolve some of this gel that was plugging everything up. And so he
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=248s)** — did survive and there's more to that story which I'll leave in another video. But you
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=257s)** — want to take 200 milligrams per day. But also what I'm going to recommend is to get it topically
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=265s)** — but make sure you get the one that does not have alcohol. And what you do is you wet your
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=271s)** — hands, okay, and then you put a couple drops in your hands, rub it together and just rub it
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=278s)** — throughout your hands and do that like once or twice a day. I'd also recommend that you
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=283s)** — put a little tiny water in your hand, put a couple more drops, rub it into your hands,
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=288s)** — and rub it through your face as well to help with hydration. The other important thing that
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=293s)** — I always emphasize is that you really need to work on creating internal health. Starting with
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=300s)** — the basic eating, right? It has to be good foods, nutrient dense. And so in other words,
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=306s)** — I'm recommending the healthy version of the ketogenic diet to make sure that you're covering
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0p8WkGSCw&t=311s)** — all bases. So for that information, you should watch this video right here. Check it out.
