- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=0s)** — There's some fascinating information I want to share with you regarding iodine that goes way beyond the thyroid.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=6s)** — So it is true that the lion's share of iodine is stored inside your thyroid.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=11s)** — But there's also iodine in the breast tissue, in the uterus, in the ovaries, in the prostate.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=18s)** — And I'm going to tell you why. In the sperm, in the stomach, in your lungs, and especially in your brain.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=25s)** — The front part of your brain that involve cognition, focus, memory, concentration.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=32s)** — And this is why if an infant is deficient in iodine at birth, they're going to have some problems with their IQ.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=39s)** — They're going to have decreased intellectual capacity.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=43s)** — And so iodine is important, and not just for your thyroid, for other things as well.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=46s)** — Now the other interesting thing about iodine is the requirements for iodine, the RDAs.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=52s)** — It's roughly in America, it's about 150 micrograms. Not milligrams, but micrograms.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=59s)** — But what's interesting about that is if you take a look at Japan, they consume on average per day
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=65s)** — between a thousand to three thousand micrograms of iodine.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=71s)** — And they don't have nearly the problem with breast cancer, with female reproductive issues,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=77s)** — and many of the other iodine deficiency problems that we have in the U.S.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=81s)** — There just is no agreement in the scientific community on how much iodine we really need
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=88s)** — as far as a therapeutic dose. They do state that the upper limits should be no more than a
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=93s)** — thousand micrograms, but that's kind of an arbitrary number because people have taken a lot
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=98s)** — more without any problems. In fact, if you have way too much iodine and create the same
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=103s)** — exact symptoms as a deficiency in iodine. Now there's two general types of iodine. The type
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=108s)** — should be used topically in the body, not internally. Like povidone iodine. That's great
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=114s)** — for fungal infections on your toes or even a skin tag or a wart, but you shouldn't take that
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=119s)** — orally. There are other types of iodine that you can take orally, but I would recommend taking
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=124s)** — it as a food base, whether it comes from actual food like shellfish or even better yet,
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=129s)** — sea kelp, which is seaweed. It comes in a package from nature that has all the other trace
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=135s)** — minerals and things that are connected with it. Because anytime you take one of anything in the
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=141s)** — body, you have to realize that you could throw off other things as well, especially when we're
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=145s)** — getting into the trace minerals, but you're more protected and you can tolerate it more if
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=150s)** — you take it from a food source like sea kelp. Of course, the key about sea kelp is making
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=155s)** — sure it's high quality. It comes from an ocean that is very, very pristine and healthy
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=161s)** — without heavy metals because you don't want contaminated toxic heavy metals in your
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=167s)** — sea kelp. Now there's some fascinating applications of using iodine to help with
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=173s)** — various body conditions. And one of the big things that iodine does is it helps to regulate
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=180s)** — estrogen, especially if there's too much estrogen in the body, as in estrogen dominance.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=186s)** — So what does that mean? It means it can help you with heavy periods, periods that go on for
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=190s)** — too long. It can help with something called fibrocystic breasts. In fact, relating to that
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=196s)** — topic, one of the best ways to identify an iodine deficiency is through just the symptom of
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=202s)** — having breast tenderness. Most of the time when a woman experiences tenderness of the breast,
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=208s)** — they're really just experiencing an iodine deficiency. So you can use iodine on fibrocystic
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=213s)** — breasts, ovarian cysts, endometriosis, fibroids, because you have high levels of iodine in the
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=221s)** — ovary, in the breast tissue, in the uterus. Also iodine can be used for a prostate enlargement.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=228s)** — Why? Because as men get older, their testosterone goes down and the relative ratios of estrogen
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=235s)** — goes up. So iodine is known to help a prostatic enlargement. But iodine is also good for
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=242s)** — other things like PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome. It's good for cystic acne. It's good
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=249s)** — for TB, upper respiratory infections, because you have iodine in your lungs. Probably to act
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=255s)** — as an antimicrobial because it's good as a defense mechanism for your immune system.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=260s)** — Iodine is also good for something called croup, which is kind of this wheezing in the upper
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=265s)** — respiratory tract where you get this high pitched sound when you're breathing in. Usually you
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=271s)** — see this in infants or even this excessive weird cough which actually sounds like a dog barking.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=278s)** — As well as asthma. I already mentioned toenail fungus. It's a good remedy for that because
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=283s)** — it's anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-candida. I've done a video on how you
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=291s)** — can use iodine to help remove a wart as well as a skin tag. I'll put that link down below.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=296s)** — And let's not forget in the importance of the thyroid. So having enough iodine can actually
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=303s)** — help you to lose more weight. It can help you with brain fog. It can help you when you're
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=309s)** — excessively cold and have dry hair and dry skin and even constipation because it supports
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=316s)** — the thyroid gland and even depression as well. But unless you consume food, okay, that is
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=324s)** — either from the sea or from vegetables that are grown on the coastline, chances are you're
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=330s)** — not going to get a lot of iodine in your foods because if it's not in the soil,
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=335s)** — it's not going to be in the plant. And so there's always going to be a very, very tiny
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=339s)** — amount of iodine in the soil. But in certain areas of the country, you could have literally
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=344s)** — a hundred times less iodine in those vegetables than vegetables that are grown by the coast,
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=350s)** — close to the ocean. There is a bit of iodine in eggs, dairy, as well as iodized salt and even
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=358s)** — sea salt. But with sea salt, there's going to be just small, small amounts. Now, another thing
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=363s)** — I want to mention is that you can't actually have an allergy to iodine. Okay, so some people
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=368s)** — have an allergy to shellfish, for example, that has iodine. You might need to get your
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=373s)** — iodine from just straight iodine. If someone is deficient in iodine, the body is going to
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=379s)** — allocate or recruit iodine and make sure you have enough for the thyroid. So it'll pull from
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=386s)** — different tissues, and that can keep you deficient in certain parts of your body and
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=391s)** — sufficient other parts. One of the most accurate ways to measure iodine, because the
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=397s)** — problem is if you get a urine sample or even a blood sample in the morning, you can have a
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=402s)** — false positive because you have the lowest amounts of iodine in the morning. So the best
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=408s)** — way to assess iodine is a 24-hour urine iodine test. Another simple test would be just to basically
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=415s)** — take a little drop of povidone iodine, put it on your skin, okay, maybe on the inside of your
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=421s)** — arm or your leg or your thigh, and then just cover an area like maybe an inch by an inch,
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=426s)** — and then see what happens within one hour. You can put maybe like a little patch over it
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=431s)** — or a band-aid, and if it disappears in one hour, chances are you are deficient in iodine.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=436s)** — You need more because your body is sucking it up. But if it's still there after an hour,
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=441s)** — chances are you probably have enough. Now, of course, that's a crude way of measuring it, but
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=445s)** — it's just one indication. And like I said before, breast tenderness is another
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=451s)** — classic symptom of a deficiency of iodine. A couple other ways that people are deficient
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=455s)** — is consuming maybe excessive amounts of raw cruciferous vegetables because there's certain
- **[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=462s)** — compounds in the cruciferous vegetables that tend to bind up that iodine. Also, if you consume
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=467s)** — millet, soy, sweet potato, you can also have the same problem. People that are vegan,
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=474s)** — plant-based, have to be very careful because they're usually eating plants that are
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=480s)** — deficient in iodine, and they don't consume shellfish. But on the other hand, if they
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=484s)** — have sea kelp, they're going to be okay. If a woman is pregnant or lactating, the demand
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=491s)** — for iodine goes up, so they should make sure that they take a little bit more. Other things
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=496s)** — compete for iodine like fluoride and bromide. If someone is on a low-salt diet because they
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=505s)** — have high blood pressure because the doctor told them to get out the salt, they can also
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=509s)** — be deficient in iodine just for not having enough of the iodine in the salt. But of course,
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=514s)** — that would have to be either iodized salt or sea salt. There's some other chemicals that
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=520s)** — commonly create problems for iodine. Perchlorate. That's like a chemical waste product from
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=526s)** — fertilizers that they put in the land, and then the runoff goes into the water supply, and then
- **[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=530s)** — it ends up in your water. So perchlorate blocks iodine as well as nitrates, which is another
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=538s)** — waste product from fertilizers. So the absolute best way to get your iodine is through a little
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=543s)** — sea kelp. You can take some on a regular basis. Just take whatever is recommended in the
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=548s)** — label, but also start consuming more shellfish to make sure you have enough as well. Now I created
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=554s)** — another video that has gotten millions of views, and this relates to using iodine to get rid of
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhUgmTCJyiE&t=560s)** — skin tags in warts. If you haven't seen that video, check it out. I put it up right here.
