- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=0s)** — I'd like to discuss the common mistakes people make when they're taking vitamin D. Vitamin D is
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=5s)** — the most important vitamin because it's involved in over 10% of all of our genetics. It's a fat
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=11s)** — soluble vitamin, which means that it absorbs better when you consume it with fat, whether it's
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=17s)** — MCT oil or olive oil or something like that. The absolute most important thing to know about
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=21s)** — vitamin D is that it won't work unless you have enough magnesium. The thing about magnesium,
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=26s)** — it's the second most important nutrient because it's involved with 300 different enzymes. Magnesium
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=33s)** — regulates excess amount of calcium that builds up in your arteries. You don't want to just take
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=38s)** — any old magnesium because the one called magnesium oxide, you do not want to take that. It only
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=43s)** — absorbs like 3-4%. And you're going to get diarrhea usually if you take more than that.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=48s)** — A better one would be magnesium glycinate. You take that in the evening, it'll help you
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=53s)** — You get like an 80% absorption. If you take magnesium citrate, okay, that's fine too. The
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=59s)** — other side note I want to mention about magnesium is that the more vitamin D that you take,
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=65s)** — the more magnesium is going to be required. Some people that take vitamin D, they react,
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=70s)** — they get a symptom from it, whether it's nausea, heart palpitations, muscle cramps,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=76s)** — sometimes it's a headache. Realize that's probably just a magnesium deficiency because
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=81s)** — the more vitamin D you take without magnesium, the more magnesium your body is going to have to
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=86s)** — pull from the reserves. And if you're already deficient, you're going to be really deficient
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=90s)** — now, thereby giving you more symptoms, which might happen more in the early morning when you
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=95s)** — wake up because that's when you have the lowest amount of magnesium in the body. Other
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=99s)** — mistake that people make with vitamin D is they don't take it with vitamin K2. Vitamin K2
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=105s)** — is another cold factor. Very, very important because think about it, vitamin D helps you
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=109s)** — absorb calcium in the blood, right? Well, K2 takes that calcium in the blood, drives it into
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=116s)** — the bone and your teeth. It keeps the calcium out of the soft tissues. What type of K2 do
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=123s)** — we need? The MKV7 version is really good if you have a lot of calcium buildup in your
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=128s)** — arteries. And it's also really good for cancer, believe it or not. And the amount that I
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=134s)** — would recommend would be 100 micrograms for every 10,000 I use of vitamin D3. Next point is
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=142s)** — another cold factor, zinc. And one of the things it does is it helps you convert cholesterol
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=147s)** — into vitamin D. I would recommend if you're taking 10,000 I use of vitamin D3 to take like
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=152s)** — 20 milligrams of zinc, zinc does a lot. In fact, it's a cold factor for all sex hormones.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=157s)** — Next point I want to bring up is the mistake of not taking enough vitamin D3. If you take
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=162s)** — the typical recommended amount, which is between 600 to 800 I use, it's not going to
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=168s)** — do anything. You need daily vitamin D3 of at least 6,000 to 8,000 to 10,000 I use every
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=177s)** — single day. And that data is not really understood by some of these researchers. And
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=182s)** — so when they do studies, they might give the people in the study vitamin D once a week,
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=187s)** — or once a month, or even once a year. You're not going to see a lot of great results with that.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=193s)** — On top of the fact that they don't like to publish positive things about vitamin D
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=198s)** — that are literally free. You can get from the sun, Dr. Michael Hollick, one of the pioneers
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=204s)** — in vitamin D research, recommends 10,000 I use every single day. And he talks about this,
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=209s)** — you're not going to get any toxic effects from that. Dr. Bruce Hollis also personally
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=214s)** — takes 10,000 I use of vitamin D3 every single day. A big part of the medical profession
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=219s)** — scares people about taking too much vitamin D3. They talk about the toxic effect. All it takes
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=224s)** — is a little fear like that to make someone hesitant. But if you look at the actual data,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=229s)** — and I've done a serious dive into this topic, you would have to take hundreds of thousands
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=234s)** — of vitamin D3 every single day for months to develop a toxic effect. The point is that when
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=242s)** — we're talking about just 10,000 I use, or even up to 50,000 I use, and you're taking also the
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=247s)** — cofactors, magnesium, K2, the zinc, all three protect against the toxicity because it helps
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=253s)** — control calcium. And just as a side note on that, if you're taking high doses of vitamin D3
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=258s)** — and you're drinking the water, and you're taking the cofactors, one more thing you could
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=262s)** — do, you could actually just avoid taking calcium supplements and also foods that are high in
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=268s)** — calcium like dairy. These are all just precautionary things if someone needs to take high doses
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=274s)** — of vitamin D3. Now when I'm talking about high doses, I'm really talking about maybe doses over
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=280s)** — 30, 40, 50,000 I use up to 100,000 I use per day. Now make note of this. I didn't say
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=288s)** — toxic doses. Okay, I said high amounts. There's a big difference. And of course,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=294s)** — I'm just giving you data to research. I'm not telling you to do it. Check with your doctor
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=298s)** — before implementing any of the things I am mentioning. Another mistake that people make
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=302s)** — with vitamin D is taking vitamin D2. Vitamin D2 does not even come close to working like
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=309s)** — vitamin D3. You're going to need a lot more of D2 to achieve the effects of D3. The other
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=314s)** — important thing to do is to actually get a vitamin D test. And when you get a test,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=319s)** — make sure you take your last vitamin D like three days before the test. So that way we
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=323s)** — get more of an accurate blood level of vitamin D3. The vitamin D in the blood is not the active
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=329s)** — form. So in other words, you could have this so-called normal vitamin D level and be extremely
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=335s)** — deficient in the active form of vitamin D deep into the cells. Other points about vitamin D,
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=340s)** — if you're on statins, if you're on steroids, both of those things are going to inhibit
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=348s)** — your ability to make vitamin D and allow vitamin D to work in your body. Just think about statins,
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=353s)** — right? That's going to lower cholesterol. Well, where does vitamin D come from? It comes from
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=357s)** — cholesterol. If you're going to get your vitamin D from the sun, realize that you're going to
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=361s)** — get it if you expose yourself between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. in the summer. Also, you're not
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=367s)** — going to get a lot of vitamin D in the early morning or the late afternoon. You really
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=372s)** — have to expose a good portion of your body. If you do that and everything is right, you
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=376s)** — might get 10,000 IU's of vitamin D3 in maybe like 20 minutes to a half hour. Make sure you
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=381s)** — don't let yourself get burned. Get slightly pink, go in the shade, and then the next day keep
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=386s)** — working on a tan. A tan is really just an increase in melanin that allows this pigment
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=392s)** — to then protect you against the UV. Another thing not to take with vitamin D3 is iron.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=397s)** — They compete. If you're going to take iron, take it at a different time. The other thing is
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=401s)** — sunblockers or sunscreen. What happens is that most of the sunblockers will block a type
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=406s)** — of ultraviolet radiation called UVB, which is the type that you need to make vitamin D. But
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=412s)** — those sunscreens don't block the UVA, which is the stuff that ages your skin. So here you are
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=418s)** — protecting your skin by rubbing on this sunscreen when it's not filtering out the entire spectrum
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=425s)** — of ultraviolet light. It's only blocking your ability to produce vitamin D3, unfortunately. I
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=431s)** — hope you learned some of the mistakes and some of the things that you can do to correct
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=434s)** — those mistakes with vitamin D3. And if you have not seen my video I did when I interviewed
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdJDzdJjXXM&t=439s)** — Dr. Bruce Hollis, you should check that out. It was fascinating. And I'll put that up right here.
