- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=0s)** — Now, there's some pretty strange, very unique, different symptoms with a B3 niacin deficiency
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=9s)** — that you need to know about because you might have these.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=12s)** — You're dealing with the four D's. Dermatitis, really bad skin reactions, diarrhea, dementia,
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=20s)** — and the fourth one is death. Other than that, you're perfectly fine.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=24s)** — But let's go through the subclinical symptoms, okay? And this might shock you. And we're
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=29s)** — talking about subclinical, we're talking about not a major deficiency. You're deficient to
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=34s)** — a certain degree. Number one, you might lose this sense of taste.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=38s)** — Number two, you might have a metallic taste in your mouth or rancid taste in your mouth.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=45s)** — That could be a niacin deficiency. And the good thing about that is just by taking
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=50s)** — it within a week, that could resolve it, depending on how deficient you are.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=53s)** — The next one is a loss of smell. Normally we think about zinc being a deficiency
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=58s)** — of smell, but it can also be niacin. Or you might have a change in your smell.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=64s)** — Things don't smell like they should. Next one is when you're looking in the
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=68s)** — mirror, your face is moving a little bit, okay? That's pretty wild. It might
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=75s)** — not necessarily be moving, but it could be changing shapes. When you read
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=79s)** — a book, you notice that the words and the page tend to move a little bit.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=84s)** — When you're walking on the ground, the ground seems to be a little unstable or
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=89s)** — could be moving a little bit. You may also have fatigue or just the feeling
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=93s)** — like you can't relax. These are all subclinical niacin deficiencies.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=98s)** — Now the major deficiency is called polygra. And just so you know, to correct
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=104s)** — these deficiencies, you can't just take the normal RDAs, which is like
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=109s)** — 20 milligrams. You'd have to take large amounts. And you can take niacin or
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=115s)** — niacinamide, which is the non-flush version, but you'd probably need amounts
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=119s)** — like six grams per day. That's a lot. But that's what it takes to correct
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=125s)** — some of these deficiencies. One big reason why we need niacin is for
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=130s)** — our mitochondria. It's called NAD. It helps you extract electrons from
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=135s)** — which is your energy currency. B3 directly is the precursor for this.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=141s)** — And also having sufficient amounts of niacin, you can produce more energy
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=145s)** — from the food that you eat. You can support something called sirtuins,
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=149s)** — which is involved in longevity and DNA repair. I mean, if you think
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=154s)** — about most diseases, they really originate from the mitochondria.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=159s)** — In all these degenerative diseases, you're going to see a great
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=162s)** — deficiency of this NAD, and especially in diseases that are related to
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=166s)** — aging, okay? Because as you age, your NAD gets less and less and less.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=172s)** — Tryptophan can actually turn into niacin. Tryptophan also converts
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=177s)** — to serotonin and then melatonin for your sleep. But B3 is super
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=183s)** — important for your skin. I mean, think about what a deficiency will
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=188s)** — severe, scaly, damaged skin. So it's super beneficial for the skin,
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=193s)** — for acne, psoriasis. If you take the form of B3 as niacinamide,
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=200s)** — that can actually help you more with inflammatory conditions
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=203s)** — like rheumatoid arthritis, any of the arthritis.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=207s)** — But the niacin version greatly helps your lipids, cholesterol, LDL, HDL.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=214s)** — It was really, really popular before we came out with statins.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=218s)** — And of course now with recent research, we found that no longer has
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=222s)** — any benefits, right? Well, if someone told me that niacin doesn't do
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=226s)** — anything, I would ask them, what happens when you become
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=229s)** — deficient in niacin? And if we take a look at what foods
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=233s)** — are high in B3, you're going to find high levels of B3 in animal
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=239s)** — meat products, as well as liver, organ meats,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=243s)** — but definitely red meat for sure at the top of the list. It's in other foods
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=247s)** — too, but not to the degree that it's in
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=249s)** — animal foods. But you can also get it from nutritional yeast.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=252s)** — If you're going to get it from nutritional yeast, I would recommend
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=255s)** — getting it without the added synthetic vitamins that
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=258s)** — they normally put in there. You can also get it from spirulina as
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=262s)** — well. There's a tremendous amount of research on niacin
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=265s)** — for cholesterol, the heart, and many other conditions. I was surprised on
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=270s)** — how much research there is on this topic. And even for schizophrenia,
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=275s)** — depression, bipolar, all sorts of mood disorders. How do we become
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=281s)** — deficient? Processed foods can create a B3 deficiency. Processed corn,
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=288s)** — processed grains, wheat, cereal, things like that. The more protein
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=292s)** — in carbs that you eat, the more the requirement for B3 is going to be
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=296s)** — because B3 is intimately involved in helping you
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=300s)** — extract energy out of food. But of course, if you're eating the right
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=304s)** — foods, you'll have your B3 that's already in these foods
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=307s)** — versus the refined foods or the ultra processed foods.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=311s)** — Pregnancy. Being an alcoholic, COVID-19 can increase the demand
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=317s)** — for B3. Therefore, explaining a lot of the symptoms with a lack of
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=321s)** — smell and taste. Yes, it can be a zinc deficiency, but don't forget
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=326s)** — about niacin. And of course, if you're on medications, a lot of
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=329s)** — your need for B3 goes way up as well. And I think a lot of people
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=334s)** — might be concerned with the flushing of the niacin. Well, you can
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=339s)** — use the non-flush version unless you have a specific problem with
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=344s)** — cholesterol and you want to lower the cholesterol, you need the
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=347s)** — flushing version. But you can just start off very small and then
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=352s)** — gradually over time increase it to the point where your body will
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=355s)** — adapt to the flushing. I personally don't mind the flushing. It's not
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=358s)** — dangerous, but sometimes people think they're allergic to it.
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=361s)** — They're not. People take niacin also for a fatty liver. And
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=365s)** — overall, there are certain things that increase the demand for
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=368s)** — niacin like I've talked about. Or it could just be you have a
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=372s)** — deficiency in your diet. Now, since we are on the topic of
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=377s)** — nutrients, if you have not seen my video on zinc, it's a real
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=381s)** — popular one, very interesting. You should check that one out as
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW_D2Sdlr3k&t=384s)** — well. I put that up right here.
