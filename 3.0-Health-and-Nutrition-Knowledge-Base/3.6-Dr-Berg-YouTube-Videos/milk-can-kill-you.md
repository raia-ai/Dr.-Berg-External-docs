- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=0s)** — Did you realize that raw milk and cheese cause 840 times more illness than pasteurized milk and cheese?
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=11s)** — I mean, this is like really scary, if it was true. It was being advertised by a media company.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=18s)** — I mean, why would a media company pay for an ad to scare people against raw milk?
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=23s)** — So today we're going to talk about is raw milk and raw cheese really that much more dangerous
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=28s)** — than pasteurized milk or cheese? You know, they say that raw milk is the number one cause of pathogens in dairy.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=36s)** — And I question that, like, is it really the raw milk that's causing the problem? Or is it the contaminated milk?
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=43s)** — I mean, just because something is pasteurized does not automatically make it safe.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=48s)** — And of course, they're going to talk about, oh, there's like high amounts of E. coli in raw milk.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=52s)** — Well, first of all, E. coli is not only in raw milk, it's also in pasteurized milk.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=58s)** — In fact, in your body right now, you have E. coli. E. coli is part of the friendly bacteria that we have in our gut.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=67s)** — In fact, E. coli helps us digest. But there's a point where E. coli can become pathogenic
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=73s)** — in the right environment. But it's not necessarily just because something is raw.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=78s)** — So it's my opinion that the problems that come along with raw milk really have to do with farms that are not clean.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=85s)** — And this is why it's so important to really know where you're getting your milk.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=89s)** — And this goes for cheese as well. I mean, if you take raw cheese versus pasteurized cheese,
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=94s)** — there's a big, big difference. First of all, the way they test to make sure that something is
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=100s)** — thoroughly pasteurized is they measure how much activity that this certain enzyme has.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=106s)** — So if this enzyme is inactive, then it's pasteurized. And so when they pasteurize and get
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=111s)** — rid of that enzyme, the question is, do you really get the benefits of building bone,
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=117s)** — making calcium and phosphorus very bioavailable? And then we get another enzyme that gets
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=122s)** — destroyed when you pasteurize the milk. And that is called lactase. Lactase is an enzyme
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=128s)** — to help break down milk sugar lactose. But when I do raw milk, and especially raw milk
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=134s)** — that has that enzyme in it, lactase, I don't have any digestive problems at all. So only the raw
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=140s)** — dairy has that enzyme to help break down milk sugar. There's been some research done to show
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=144s)** — that children that consume raw milk versus pasteurized milk have lower incidence of asthma,
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=151s)** — allergies, decreased incidence of ear infections, and eczema, and even less respiratory
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=157s)** — infection. You're going to get a lot of support for the immune system. There are a lot
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=161s)** — different immune factors that get destroyed with the pasteurization. Then you get the
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=166s)** — other benefit of raw milk and raw milk cheese with probiotics. So what are probiotics? Those
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=173s)** — are friendly bacteria. When you consume things like cheese or kefir, you're getting not only
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=180s)** — a good probiotic, but a probiotic that can actually reseed your gut. I mean, I think people
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=185s)** — think about yogurt and kefir as a probiotic, but they don't think about raw cheese as a
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=190s)** — probiotic as well. However, in America, if a cheese is fermented over 60 days, it can be
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=198s)** — considered raw. So recently I was in Bethesda shopping at this boutique specialty store,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=204s)** — and I was trying to find some European cheeses, and I found a bunch of them and some
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=210s)** — American cheeses that said that they're raw. So they were fermented over 60 days. And I
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=215s)** — went home and I was consuming these cheeses, and I found one that was really delicious.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=219s)** — It was actually from America called Meadow Creek Dairy Cheese. I got the package after
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=226s)** — consuming all the cheese and I said, I gotta find out where to get more of this, right?
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=231s)** — I found out it's about 40 minutes away from my farm in southern Virginia. And then after
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=236s)** — studying their website, I realized why it was so good. And apparently they bred, not only was
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=240s)** — it raw, but the farm is super clean, French cows with certain American cows, and they just
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=248s)** — spend the time to do it right. There are a lot of different options with cheeses, but
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=251s)** — this one's a good one. I'll put the link down below. I like the Mountaineer hard cheese
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=256s)** — from that company. Now there's probably not a difference in nutrients between raw cheese
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=261s)** — and pasteurized cheese, but the bioavailability of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and other
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=267s)** — minerals are probably a lot better from raw cheese just because it's raw and it has more
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=271s)** — enzymes. And of course, I always want to get the raw cheese that's from grass-fed cows.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=276s)** — And that way I'll have the right omega-6, omega-3 ratios. And also there's another great
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=282s)** — compound called CLA, which helps you lose weight. It's good for energy. It's anti-inflammatory.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=289s)** — So in summary, do I think raw milk is safe? Absolutely. If it is purchased from a farm
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=295s)** — that is clean, so you need to study up on the farm that you buy your raw milk from,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEs2epLMq4Y&t=299s)** — or raw milk cheese, and then make your own decisions.
