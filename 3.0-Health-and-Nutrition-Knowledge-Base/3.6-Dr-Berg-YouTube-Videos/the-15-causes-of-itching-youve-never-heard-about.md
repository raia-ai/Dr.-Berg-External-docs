- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=0s)** — So today we're... oh one second, let me just... oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's the spot. A little to the left,
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=10s)** — good. A little to the right, oh my gosh, these come in handy. Today we're going to talk about
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=16s)** — the 15 deeper causes of itching that you probably have never heard about before.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=23s)** — So the medical name for itching is called pruritus, okay? And the remedy typically
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=28s)** — is just to scratch the itch, right? And it usually involves some superficial nerve that is within
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=34s)** — your skin that's being aggravated to some level. You can have lice on your body, scabies, which is
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=40s)** — a microorganism. You could have hookworms, herpes, an insect bite like bed bugs. You can even have
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=47s)** — a yeast infection different places in your body, usually private parts. Or you can have poison
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=51s)** — ivy. Now I am deadly allergic to poison ivy and when I get it, it spreads and boy does it itch like
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=59s)** — crazy and I have to resist the temptation to scratch it. I found that going into a hot shower
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=64s)** — tends to be the only thing that can relieve the itching for three hours. But I can definitely
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=70s)** — relate to poison ivy. Then you have a tick bite, right? Usually tick bites initially kind of
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=81s)** — different tick bites that I found on my body because I live in the countryside and some even
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=86s)** — had the bullseye and I never got lime. So that's good. But sometimes you have to kind of check
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=91s)** — yourself because you don't know if these ticks are on your body. But sometimes they do leave
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=96s)** — an itch and you can find out where they are. And you can also itch from having diabetes.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=100s)** — Now why would a diabetic start itching? Because they have problems with circulation,
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=105s)** — specifically blood flow to nerve endings. So like even in the bottom of your feet, you can have
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=111s)** — what's called peripheral neuropathy where the blood flow to the nerves are not happening. And
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=115s)** — so the nerves start dying off. And so the sensation could be anywhere from an itching to
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=121s)** — a burning pain to an actual severe pain. You can start losing circulation and the circulation
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=128s)** — is necessary for the nerves to function correctly. There's another condition called
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=133s)** — polycythemia where you have too many red blood cells, which can create a lack of circulation
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=140s)** — in your blood flow, lowered oxygen into your actual skin itself. And that's what's causing
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=145s)** — the itching. And even a problem with the parathyroid gland. The parathyroid gland is
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=150s)** — four glands that are around your thyroid and they control calcium. And if the thyroid is
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=158s)** — working too hard, you can start developing too much calcium in the blood and then too much
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=164s)** — calcium that deposits in the skin and even create calcification of your skin. And that can
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=172s)** — affect the nerve endings. So there's been an associated relationship between people that had
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=178s)** — severe itching and then they have their parathyroids removed and the itching goes away.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=182s)** — And then you have a problem with the kidney called uremia where you have this build-up of urea
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=189s)** — in the skin and that's creating all sorts of irritation on the nerves because someone has an
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=195s)** — advanced kidney disease. Then you have the liver. And this is very common whether you
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=199s)** — have cirrhosis of the liver or hepatitis. When the liver, which is supposed to make
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=204s)** — bile salts, can't make the bile salts anymore, then you start developing this thickened sludge
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=210s)** — that comes down these little ducts into the gallbladder called cholestasis. And you're
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=215s)** — going to feel like a fullness underneath your right rib cage and maybe even pain that refers
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=220s)** — to your right shoulder blade. And then you have also a condition where you have dry skin.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=225s)** — That can create itching probably because the gallbladder doesn't have enough bile to be
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=229s)** — able to pull in vitamin A from the foods or you're not consuming a lot of vitamin A.
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=235s)** — Or it could be also a lack of vitamin D which can increase inflammation. And so when I was in
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=240s)** — practice there's a high correlation between people that have itching and people that have
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=246s)** — gallbladder issues or liver issues. One would be just irritation of the gallbladder directly.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=251s)** — Number two, it can decrease your omega-3 fatty acids because omega-6 and omega-3 compete.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=258s)** — The average person has like 20 times more omega-6 to omega-3. The remedy is very simple.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=265s)** — You just need to change your diet and there's a remedy called TUTCUP. It's a type of bile salt
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=272s)** — that thins the bile and it's been found to significantly decrease itching in people with
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=277s)** — like cirrhosis. So I will put that research down below as well. Now what's interesting
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=283s)** — about the relief of scratching and itch is that you're going to stimulate serotonin
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=291s)** — and dopamine as the relief chemicals. And there's even professional back scratchers that you can go
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=297s)** — get your back scratched and pay someone to do that which is pretty wild because it's very
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=302s)** — relaxing. But anyway, I wanted to increase your awareness on what's behind parietis especially if
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=308s)** — it's on a chronic nature and give you a lot more information so you could potentially
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=312s)** — identify the real reason why you might have itching. Now since I did mention the gallbladder,
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=316s)** — if you have not seen my videos on the gallbladder, I put up a really good one right here.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVr3AAYC80&t=322s)** — You should check it out.
