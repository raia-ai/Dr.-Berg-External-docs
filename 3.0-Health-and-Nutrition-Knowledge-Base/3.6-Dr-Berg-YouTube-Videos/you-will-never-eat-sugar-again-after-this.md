- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=0s)** — Now, you may just end up quitting sugar after watching this video. I'm just warning you.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=4s)** — Don't get mad at me. I'm just the messenger. There are 73 meta-analysis that make up
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=11s)** — 8600 different studies on sugar. And the conclusions are a high amount of added sugar,
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=18s)** — okay, is significantly associated with 45 negative health effects ranging from diabetes to asthma,
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=26s)** — depression, stroke, heart attack, gout, hypertension, dementia, cancer, and early death.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=33s)** — Other than that, it's totally fine. Now, it's interesting because the World Health Organization
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=37s)** — allows people to consume up to 12 teaspoons of added sugar, right, before it becomes unhealthy.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=45s)** — I've talked to many people who say, well, I don't need to do the ketogenic diet and go
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=49s)** — on a low carb diet because I don't have a weight problem. I usually say, have you ever
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=53s)** — heard of skinny fat? Chances are if they're consuming added sugar, they have visceral fat,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=59s)** — they have liver fat. They just don't know it yet. But 40% of people of normal weight
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=66s)** — have metabolic syndrome. That includes high blood glucose, fatty liver, high cholesterol.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=73s)** — And there's another point about obesity I want to make. There's a certain percentage,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=77s)** — I think it's 20% of obese people have normal metabolism and they live a long life. And so
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=84s)** — just because someone's overweight doesn't necessarily mean they're super unhealthy
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=89s)** — or they're healthy. There's other factors involved. Now, then you have health authorities
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=94s)** — that will talk about sugar as being empty calories. In reality, sugar is very toxic.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=102s)** — Roughly half of it is fructose. Okay. And the other half is glucose. Fructose is very,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=108s)** — very toxic to the body. I would venture to say it's as toxic as alcohol. And if you ever
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=114s)** — think about where alcohol comes from, they usually make it from some type of sugar, right?
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=119s)** — But if we compare fructose with alcohol and which problems each one can influence both
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=125s)** — fructose and alcohol cause hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart attacks, cause
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=131s)** — insulin resistance, fatty liver. They both cause pancreatitis. You know, nature has basically made
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=137s)** — sugar hard to get. Our ancestors would get sugar during harvest season from fruit, right? And
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=145s)** — even honey has a season to it and it's hard to get because there's bees. But man has made
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=149s)** — sugar very easy to get. And you know, you have people who say, well, why doesn't the
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=153s)** — government regulate sugar just like alcohol, right? Well, that's not going to happen. There's
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=159s)** — too much money involved with sugar. The sugar lobbyists and the corn lobbyists and the
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=164s)** — sweet beverage lobbyists are extremely powerful. I mean, the sugar sector accounts for
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=171s)** — a third of all the donations from U.S. agriculture while they only make up 2% of the farms.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=179s)** — So a lot of the money that goes into lobbying comes from the sugar industry. These lobbyists
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=185s)** — influence the dietary guidelines, food pyramid, but it's no secret that the U.S. sugar industry
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=192s)** — cannot afford negative perceptions of its products. And so it has a really strong
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=197s)** — purpose of discrediting research that says that sugar could be harmful to human health.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=202s)** — So if you think the government's going to help regulate this, it's not going to happen. There's
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=206s)** — just too much money involved. It's going to have to be you stopping the consumption
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=213s)** — of sugar. Now there's many things that you can do to make this transition. There's all sorts of
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=220s)** — keto-friendly sweets and desserts. Like even, for example, Lily's chocolate.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=228s)** — This has sugar alcohols. You can do this. You can consume this. Here's one right here. Look
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=233s)** — at this. One carb keto chocolate frosting. That's one. Here's one right here. Better sugar.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=243s)** — Sweet leaf. Here's a called nutrell. No sugar. It's kind of like a little cereal you can consume.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=254s)** — So these are things that you can do to make the transition. Here's one.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=260s)** — Keto candied pecans. If you need to do these type of things and get off sugar, go ahead.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=266s)** — It'll be easy because they taste very similar to sugar, but they don't have the actual sugar.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=271s)** — When you eat sugar, you're supporting the sugar industry. And on top of that, you're destroying
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLgSAwuygo&t=275s)** — your body. Now if you want to know how to transition off sugar, I have a video just for
