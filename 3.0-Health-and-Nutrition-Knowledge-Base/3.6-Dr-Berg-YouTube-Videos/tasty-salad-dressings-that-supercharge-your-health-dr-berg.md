- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=0s)** — I'd like to share some very tasty and super healthy, six delicious salad dressings that will supercharge your health.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=9s)** — Now, what prompted me to do this video is a while ago, I went to this event where a five-star chef cooked for us and we were participating in the cooking.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=19s)** — And so I was in charge of making the salad dressing. And so I asked him, well, okay, what do I do? He says, uh, just go ahead and wing it.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=25s)** — There's some spices over there. Go ahead and make it. I'm sure it'll be fine. I don't have a lot of experience in this topic.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=31s)** — I usually just use two ingredients, olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. So I started to put a bunch of things together and then he came by and tasted it.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=40s)** — And he just looked at me like, what the hell did you do? And I said, uh, I don't know. I just threw some things together.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=48s)** — He goes, Eric, it's obvious. It's obvious to make this. I said, no, it's not obvious.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=52s)** — To make something taste good, you have to have the combination of certain herbs and things, or else it could be a disaster.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=60s)** — The problem with salad dressings is trying to find one that is edible. That doesn't have all these high omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=67s)** — I mean, it's really hard to find something just with pure olive oil. Even the ones with olive oil have additional oils.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=73s)** — So the benefit of adding olive oil to your salad is this. A lot of the phytonutrients in salad, like these very important
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=81s)** — health promoting chemicals in plants, especially salad, go way beyond just vitamins and minerals.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=89s)** — The phytonutrients or the phytochemicals in salad are fat soluble, which means we need to eat them with some type of fat or oil.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=99s)** — And I'm going to recommend use a high quality extra virgin olive oil. So these six salad dressings that I'm going to talk about
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=105s)** — will add some additional health benefits that go way beyond just the salad itself.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=110s)** — Now of course salad is loaded with potassium, magnesium, folate, vitamin C, as well as all these phytonutrients.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=118s)** — But the salad dressing itself can really take it to the next level. So these salad dressings that I'm going to recommend
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=124s)** — are all wrapped around this base of extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and apple cider vinegar.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=133s)** — And then what you do is you put this mixture, this base, in a 16 ounce mason jar in your fridge.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=139s)** — So every time you eat a salad you take out this mixture and in a little bowl you take about a
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=145s)** — fourth of a cup or you know up to a half of a cup depending on how big your salad is.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=150s)** — Then you add your spices, mix it up, and pour it on your salad. So let's first talk about this
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=155s)** — base that you're going to make. Okay this is these three ingredients. What are the ratios?
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=160s)** — It comes out to a third of a cup of extra virgin olive oil, a fourth of a cup of apple cider vinegar,
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=166s)** — and two tablespoons of lemon juice. So let's first talk about the first combination. This could be
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=173s)** — called the apple cider vinaigrette. You're going to add one tablespoon of mustard. Some people
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=178s)** — use Dijon. You'll take one clove of garlic, minced, a pinch of sea salt, and a dash of
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=185s)** — pepper. Mix it up, pour it on your salad. All right so the next combination is the French
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=190s)** — dressing. We're going to add one teaspoon of dried tarragon, half a teaspoon of dried thyme,
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=197s)** — a fourth of a teaspoon of dried lavender, and a pinch of ground pepper. Very delicious.
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=203s)** — Another one to try is the Italian version. For this one we're going to use one teaspoon
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=207s)** — of dried oregano, half a teaspoon of dried basil, a fourth of a teaspoon of crushed garlic,
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=214s)** — and just a little pinch of crushed red pepper. So I really like that combination. Very delicious.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=220s)** — All right, next one. Mediterranean. With this one you're going to use one teaspoon of dried
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=225s)** — rosemary, half a teaspoon of dried mint, a fourth of a teaspoon of sumac, with just one
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=231s)** — little pinch of sea salt. All right, just to keep things interesting, let's give you two more.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=236s)** — This one is the Asian version. For this one you're going to add to the base one teaspoon
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=241s)** — of toasted sesame seeds, one half of a teaspoon of dried ginger, one fourth of a teaspoon
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=247s)** — crushed peppercorn, and a splash of tamari. And let's not forget the Indian version,
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=253s)** — okay, for my friends in India. For this one we're going to add to the base one teaspoon
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=258s)** — of ground coriander, one half teaspoon of ground turmeric, one fourth of a teaspoon of ground
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=264s)** — cinnamon, with a pinch of dried cardamom. So I think these six recipes will keep things very
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=271s)** — interesting for you. It'll actually keep the variety there. If you have not seen my video
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH-mc-yMMbA&t=276s)** — on the quantity of salad that a person should be consuming, which is seven to ten cups,
