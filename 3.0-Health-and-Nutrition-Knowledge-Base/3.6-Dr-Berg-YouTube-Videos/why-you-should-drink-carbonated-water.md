- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=0s)** — Now I've been very curious about why I feel so much better when I drink carbonated water
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=7s)** — versus regular water. And I didn't know the answer until very recently. So I'm going to share this
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=11s)** — with you as well as some other fascinating things related to CO2, carbon dioxide. So whether
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=18s)** — you're drinking soda water, club water, seltzer water, La Croix, or any type of carbonated water,
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=24s)** — this relates to CO2 because the way they carbonate it is by adding this gas CO2 into the water,
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=31s)** — which does make it slightly acidic because it turns into carbonic acid. Unless it's stored
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=37s)** — a little bit differently as these bicarbonates in water. But regardless of that, when I drink
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=42s)** — carbonated water I just feel more hydrated, my digestion is better, and I just feel better. I
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=49s)** — feel more relaxed when I drink carbonated water. So if you happen to see some other videos
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=53s)** — related to carbon dioxide, I mentioned this one effect called the Bohr effect. B-O-H-R.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=61s)** — That is a condition that relates to CO2. In other words, for oxygen to be absorbed into
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=66s)** — your cells, into the tissues, it takes CO2, which is very counterintuitive. You would think,
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=73s)** — logically, if you got more air, less CO2, you would have more oxygen. But that's not true.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=79s)** — It takes that CO2 to slightly adjust the pH and drop it a little bit and make it slightly more
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=86s)** — acidic to allow the oxygen to be released. This is why if you hyperventilate in a panic
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=91s)** — attack, you're getting too much O2 and not enough CO2 and you can't breathe, right? And
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=97s)** — then you start breathing in a paper bag and you get more CO2 and now you can breathe.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=101s)** — In fact, you can actually create a hypoxic state that is a state of lowered oxygen
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=107s)** — by depriving the tissues of CO2, which is very interesting. Because normally you would think
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=113s)** — hypoxia, low oxygen, means too much CO2, which can occur, but you can also create that
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=120s)** — same situation with not enough CO2. So CO2 is really essential in the homeostasis of
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=127s)** — oxygen absorption. Now in Europe, they actually have these sauna baths that are carbonated.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=136s)** — They call them carbonated spas or baths where they pump the CO2 into this water. And apparently
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=142s)** — it's great for all sorts of circulatory problems, like problems with your vascular system,
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=148s)** — especially something called peripheral vascular disorders. They even use it for diabetic
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=152s)** — wounds and to decrease the rate of getting an amputation where they cut off the feet. I mean,
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=158s)** — it can actually improve that by increasing microvascular circulation. Basically CO2 increases
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=163s)** — blood flow. It's even used as the therapy after someone gets a stroke and they have this hypoxic
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=170s)** — low oxygen state because the CO2 helps that oxygen go deep into the cells. Now I could not
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=178s)** — find any research on drinking carbonated water, okay, in that relating to an improved health,
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=186s)** — but I have found parallel research on all the things I'm talking about and I'll include
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=190s)** — In one study I found there was a significant increase in the parasympathetic nervous system
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=196s)** — activation by increasing CO2. That's the system that counters the flight or fight mode.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=202s)** — It's the system that helps your healing and your digestion and your ability to sleep. And
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=206s)** — the device they use to measure the parasympathetic is what I used in my practice, which is
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=211s)** — technology called heart rate variability. Let's take a look at some other things that I found
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=215s)** — related to this. If you take a normal cell inside and then you take a cancer cell and we look at
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=222s)** — the pH of each one, the cancer cell actually is more alkaline. Now the outside of the cell,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=229s)** — more acidic because of all the byproducts from lactic acid, things like that, but the
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=233s)** — inside of the cell is more alkaline than a normal cell, which is very interesting, especially
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=237s)** — as it relates to CO2. And I couldn't find any information on this, but think about this.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=242s)** — When you deprive the tissue of CO2, you actually can develop alkalosis. That is a state of being
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=248s)** — too alkaline. So without that CO2 turning into carbonic acid, you can develop an overly
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=254s)** — alkaline state. And then I wanted to figure out, is there any relationship or any significant
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=260s)** — improvement in shrinking tumors or stopping the spread of cancer by increasing CO2? And I
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=267s)** — found a bunch of research, which is also very interesting, which I'll include down below.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=271s)** — So apparently CO2 is a significant potent anti-tumor gas. It has the ability to
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=282s)** — inhibit metastasis, which is interesting, as well as inducing apoptosis, which causes the
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=288s)** — cancer cells to commit suicide. It also inhibits this very interesting gene that's involved
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=295s)** — in this switching mechanism between a normal cell and it turning into cancer. That gene is
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=302s)** — HIF-alpha, which is involved in hypoxia. Now this probably doesn't make sense unless you
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=307s)** — understand that CO2 allows oxygen to go into the tissues. And as bad as hypoxia is,
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=314s)** — it can be created by a lowered amount of CO2, as well as lowered oxygen levels. But also,
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=320s)** — there's this CO2 connection that is very interesting. I had this thing in my mind where
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=325s)** — if we just flood the body with oxygen, right, we'll be able to kill the cancer and
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=329s)** — prevent cancer. But apparently, the CO2 is another key factor that we cannot ignore.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=335s)** — Like even in a thunderstorm, you can probably breathe better. And if you ever wanted to know
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=341s)** — why, well apparently there's a lot more CO2 in the air after a thunderstorm than there is
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=349s)** — when there's not a thunderstorm going on. Also, you'll actually get more oxygen into
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=353s)** — your tissues if you breathe through your nose, not your mouth when you're sleeping,
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=358s)** — as well as when you exercise. There's another interesting natural bath, like the springs.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=365s)** — If you go to the hot springs. And at first we might think there's a lot of minerals involved
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=369s)** — that are helping us. But guess what? There's a significant amount of CO2 in hot springs,
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=375s)** — which could be the reason why you feel better and you're more relaxed. Now,
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=380s)** — they're even using CO2 in various creams for hydration to your skin and better
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=386s)** — circulation and blood flow, which is another interesting piece of this puzzle.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=391s)** — And the last point about the CO2 is that CO2 apparently is a potent anti-inflammatory.
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=398s)** — So I just wanted to increase your awareness on the CO2, this carbon dioxide thing,
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=403s)** — as well as carbonated water. And this could be the reason, which I think it is,
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=407s)** — of why you may feel better if you consume more carbonated water. And what I have is I have a
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=416s)** — water carbonated. So I take my spring water and I carbonate it and that's what I drink.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=422s)** — But since we're on the topic of water, you haven't seen this video. I think you should
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XspP7Cbw4fA&t=426s)** — watch it. There's definitely more information to be known about water. And I put it up right here.
