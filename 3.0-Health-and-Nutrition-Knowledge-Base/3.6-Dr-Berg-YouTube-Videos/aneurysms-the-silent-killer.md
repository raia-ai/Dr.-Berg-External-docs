- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=0s)** — A lot of people are concerned about heart attacks and strokes. What about an aneurysm? An aneurysm
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=5s)** — can cause a stroke and it can definitely cause you to die. So today I'm going to teach you a
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=10s)** — little bit about aneurysms, what's involved, and what you need to do to prevent aneurysms.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=16s)** — The first symptom or early signs of an aneurysm is there is no symptom. Why? Because an
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=22s)** — aneurysm is just like this bulging dilation of your vascular system. And unless it presses
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=28s)** — on something, you're not going to feel really any major symptoms at all until it ruptures.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=35s)** — And when it ruptures, you have a hole in your artery. So the blood's going to come out.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=40s)** — And if this happens in your brain, you get a stroke. And potentially you might have a limited
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=44s)** — time to get to the emergency room to do something about it, but not always. So I
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=50s)** — think it's important to talk about aneurysms and what it is and what you can do to prevent
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=54s)** — You can have an aneurysm in the brain, around the heart, in the aorta, or in the kidneys,
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=60s)** — many different places. And there's also a simple test that's highly correlated to if a person
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=66s)** — has an aneurysm. And that is called the thumb to palm test. So if you just take your
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=70s)** — hand right now, and you take your thumb across your hand like this, and if your thumb can
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=77s)** — extend to the outer part of your hand, that can mean that you have extra loose collagen,
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=82s)** — and there's a high correlation between people that have this loose collagen and aneurysms.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=90s)** — Now it doesn't mean that you have an aneurysm. And if you can't move this over here, that
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=93s)** — doesn't mean you don't have an aneurysm. It's just something to look at. In fact, do this
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=98s)** — test right now and comment down below if you can extend your thumb past your hand right here.
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=104s)** — I'm really curious to know. So let's say, for example, you don't have loose ligament
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=109s)** — structure, and that's not the cause. What are some of the causes? Well, we have smoking. Now
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=115s)** — you're probably wondering like, wait a second, smoking goes into the lungs, not the blood,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=119s)** — right? Well, where do you think the oxygen and CO2 is being exchanged when you breathe?
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=124s)** — Your lungs directly connect with your capillaries, which go right into your blood.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=128s)** — And if that thing is smoke, you're going to get carbon dioxide, you're going to get a lot
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=132s)** — of different chemicals that can start to irritate the lining of the artery. In fact,
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=138s)** — smokers have a 4x greater risk of getting an aneurysm than those non-smokers. And then,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=145s)** — of course, we have alcohol because there are certain byproducts and chemicals that can
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=149s)** — irritate the lining of the arteries. And I'm talking about like a chronic drinker, not
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=154s)** — occasionally. And then, of course, we have diabetics and people who consume a lot of
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=158s)** — sugar. So if we expose this layer of the inside of the artery to sugar and hidden sugars,
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=165s)** — like in starches, right? Modified food starch, maltodextrin, which is in a lot of different
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=170s)** — foods, that can create oxidation and damage to the inside of the arteries if you're
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=175s)** — consuming it on a regular basis. And then you have seed oils. And that's another thing
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=181s)** — that can create chronic inflammation. And this next one is very interesting. Dental
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=186s)** — bacteria. Like bacteria and anapses in your gums. They found that in the aneurysm. And
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=193s)** — they also find it in plaque. So apparently that can leak out into your vascular system
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=197s)** — and end up creating inflammation because there's an infection going on. So that's another
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=203s)** — cause of inflammation in this layer in the heart. Anything that creates chronic
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=209s)** — oxidation or inflammation can start to weaken this arterial system. And then on top of that,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=215s)** — if you have high blood pressure, now we get all this pressure with all this inflammation.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=221s)** — Now it starts to break down your arteries to the point where it's starting to bulge out. And so
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=225s)** — you really have to kind of just look at potentially what it could be for you. If you
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=231s)** — have high blood pressure, for example, you want to take more potassium, magnesium,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=236s)** — vitamin D. Those are the three things that will help bring the pressure down,
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=241s)** — including going on a low carb diet. There's something else that can cause an aneurysm. It's
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=246s)** — common, but it's a copper deficiency. Copper is necessary in helping you build collagen.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=253s)** — If you're deficient in copper, you can't make the connective tissue to make everything nice and
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=259s)** — strong and firm. Copper does a lot of other things too. It actually acts as an anti-fungal,
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=263s)** — antibacterial. And one way to create a copper deficiency is to take a lot of zinc for a long
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=272s)** — time without the copper. So you need that ratio of zinc to copper. So what are all the things
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=278s)** — that you can do to prevent an aneurysm? Well, of course, avoiding those things that create
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=283s)** — inflammation, start to consume antioxidants. That can be in the form of herbs or vitamin D,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=291s)** — or vitamin B, vitamin C, or foods with those nutrients, vegetables. And then to counteract a
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=298s)** — the seed oils, we need the omega-3 fatty acids. And out of all the foods that are very high in
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=303s)** — omega-3, you have the carnivore oil, you also have fish, as in salmon. Vitamin D is also very,
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=310s)** — very important. Vitamin D helps to prevent leaky arteries. You can also have a leaky
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=318s)** — blood-brain barrier. And vitamin D prevents that, which is interesting. It's a very powerful
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=324s)** — anti-inflammatory. So getting a lot of sun is very important without getting burned. And in the
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=330s)** — wintertime, you take your vitamin D3. Minimally 10,000 I use. And probably one of the most
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=336s)** — important things to do regular exercise, because this way you can keep strengthening the arterial
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=344s)** — system over time. So it lasts a long time. So it becomes elastic. So it doesn't become weak.
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsl0Gsqgf94&t=350s)** — And exercise in general increases antioxidants that you make yourself.
