- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=0s)** — I have a quiz for you today and I want to see which one of these do you think is healthier.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=5s)** — We're mainly only looking at the nutritional facts. So we have product A and product B.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=10s)** — On the left there's 29 grams of total fat. On the right there's 8 grams of total fat.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=15s)** — On the left there's 4 grams of saturated fat. On the right there's only 1 gram of saturated fat.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=24s)** — On the left there is 17 grams of carbohydrate. On the right there's 16 grams of carbohydrate.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=31s)** — On the left there's 1 gram of sugar. And on the right there's 0 grams of sugar. So based on that
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=38s)** — data, which one is healthier? Now you're probably going to pick B, right? Well let's take a look
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=45s)** — at what A is. A is avocados. Let's be Doritos. That's right, Doritos. Tip number one, you cannot
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=53s)** — determine the health of a product by the nutritional facts. You must look at the
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=61s)** — ingredients. Let's take a look at these ingredients. The first one is corn and then
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=66s)** — we have vegetable oil. Corn, canola, and or sunflower oil. And then we have maltodextrin.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=72s)** — Then we have a bunch of other things. And then we have monosodium glutamate. And then dextrose.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=77s)** — And in a minute I'm going to simplify this whole thing for you. So really there's only
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=81s)** — three ingredients you have to watch out for. Everything else is a side note. But let's just
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=86s)** — do one more test. Okay, we have label A and label B. On the left we have 0 grams of total
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=93s)** — fat. On the right we have 0 grams of total fat. Of course there's going to be no
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=98s)** — on either one of those. So now we're at the total carbohydrates. A is 25 grams of total
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=104s)** — carbohydrates. B is only 13 grams of total carbohydrates. A is 19 grams of sugar. And B
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=112s)** — is 11 grams of sugar. Based on the data, which one is healthier? If you said B, okay,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=120s)** — let's take a look at A. Hmm, A is an apple. Let's take a look at what B is. Oh, what's
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=127s)** — that? That is something called Sunny D. It's like an orange drink. But let's take a look at the
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=134s)** — actual ingredients in this orange drink. Oh, we have the first ingredients, which is water.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=140s)** — And then we have high fructose corn syrup. And then we have like 2% or less of all these
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=147s)** — concentrated juices, right? And then we roll right into the modified cornstarch and canola
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=154s)** — oil. If you just depend on the traditional facts, that would be healthier than an apple.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=159s)** — All right, so what are we dealing with? We're just dealing with what is called
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=163s)** — ultra-processed foods, aka junk foods. Processed means removal. So you're taking away the fiber,
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=172s)** — the vitamins, the minerals, the trace minerals, the phytonutrients, the enzymes. We're taking
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=179s)** — everything out of it and we're leaving some basic material. And then we get the word ultra.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=185s)** — Ultra means severe. So when we're severely taking away things, we're going through
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=191s)** — many different industrial processes or chemical reactions, including grinding something down,
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=197s)** — pulverizing it, high pressure, high heats, adding chemicals like solvents to extract certain
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=205s)** — things, taking out the colors with chemicals, taking out the flavoring or odors from it. And
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=212s)** — then you're ending up with this something that doesn't even resemble the original
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=216s)** — food. And so this is why they have to add flavoring. They have to add coloring. They
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=222s)** — have to add textures. They have to add preservatives. They have to add some synthetic
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=226s)** — vitamins to prevent certain diseases. And then they have to package it and make it look
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=231s)** — amazing for you to eat. So the big question is if we compare ultra processed food to the
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=238s)** — definition of food, which is this. Food is that which is eaten to sustain life, provide energy
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=247s)** — and promote the growth and repair of tissues. So it has to keep you alive, give you energy,
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=254s)** — help you grow and help you repair. So can ultra processed calories actually do that?
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=262s)** — No, it can't. In reality, ultra processed food is not food. Now out of all the things that
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=269s)** — cause disease that destroy your health, I would venture to say that ultra processed foods
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=274s)** — are the most significant factor in causing health problems. If you disagree, please make
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=281s)** — down below and tell me what you think. Is it infection? Is it old age? Is it lack of activity?
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=288s)** — Or is it more junk food? Simply because 80% of the calories in the grocery store are ultra
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=295s)** — processed food. So the countries that consume the most ultra processed foods have the most
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=300s)** — health problems. And the United States is right up there at the top. So how can we make this
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=304s)** — really simple? Number one, ignore the nutritional facts. Okay, go right to the
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=309s)** — ingredients. And there's three things that you want to avoid. Seed oils, all the forms of sugar,
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=316s)** — and you want to avoid the starches. A lot of times when people define junk foods, they throw
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=322s)** — in the saturated fats. But when I went to the store last week and I was looking at all
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=327s)** — these junk foods, I didn't see a lot of saturated fat. I saw a lot of unsaturated fat,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=333s)** — seed oils. Our diet is about almost 30% seed oils. That's creating a lot of damage, inflammation,
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=342s)** — insulin resistance, neurodegenerative problems. And by the way, I have a link down below
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=348s)** — that you can download a little cutout for your wallet that basically describe in detail the
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=354s)** — three things you should avoid and all the other kind of names for the sugar, starches,
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=360s)** — seed oils that you might not recognize. So you can pull this out of your wallet
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=363s)** — and just have it right there when you go shopping. All right, let's move to sugar.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=367s)** — And a lot of times when you see sugar, it doesn't tell you if it's beet sugar or
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=371s)** — cane sugar or other types of sugar. But sugar is also in other forms. Glucose syrup,
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=378s)** — high fructose corn syrup, dextrose, and just straight glucose. Now let's move to the
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=384s)** — starches. Corn, corn starch, modified corn starch, modified food starch, maltodextrin,
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=395s)** — dextrin, corn flour, wheat flour, modified wheat starch. Now there's two more things that are
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=403s)** — kind of on the side that I would also recommend not consuming as well. Soy protein
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=409s)** — isolate. This is kind of an ingredient that fits into the definition of ultra-processed food
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=416s)** — because it's so altered and so refined. And then model sodium glutamate because that's a
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=421s)** — flavor enhancer. So go ahead and click the link down below and download the little card
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=428s)** — cutout so you can put it in your wallet and start reading labels and start getting
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg8Ik04WpM&t=433s)** — the stuff out of your diet.
