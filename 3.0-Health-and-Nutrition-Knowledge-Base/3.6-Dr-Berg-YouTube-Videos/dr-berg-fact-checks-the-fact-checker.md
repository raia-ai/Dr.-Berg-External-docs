- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=0s)** — so there was a doctor, Gil Carvalho, who did a fact checking video on me, so today we're going to do a fact checking video on the fact checker.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=9s)** — so we got a ton of requests from a lot of you guys to comment on this video.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=14s)** — okay, so the first thing he says is there's a ton of you that requested to do a video on one of my videos.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=22s)** — hmm, what does my channel have to do with your channel? i'm just curious, like,
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=28s)** — can you just maybe show us how many people actually requested this video? we're going to focus only on
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=35s)** — the substance. no ad ominums. i didn't google him, i don't know anything about him, i didn't go watch
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=40s)** — a bunch of his other videos for context, nothing. because it doesn't matter. the only thing that
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=46s)** — matters is whether the claims match the evidence. so don't you hate that when you know that
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=50s)** — there's some bad news coming, there are some negative things about you coming, but they kind of
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=58s)** — won't... we'll be really nice to them. as someone maybe pushes you underneath the bus. okay, let's continue.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=64s)** — let's go. this was in 2018. the new guidelines by the american heart association. okay, this is
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=70s)** — brand new. they said total cholesterol is not significantly associated with heart disease.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=79s)** — okay, that's a new finding. they just found out. looking at your total cholesterol doesn't
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=84s)** — really give you a lot of information in relationship to predicting heart disease.
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=92s)** — i don't know what he's talking about. total cholesterol is not the best marker,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=95s)** — it's a dirty marker, but it definitely associates with cardiovascular disease with heart disease.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=101s)** — i don't remember any american heart association guidelines saying that it just doesn't associate,
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=106s)** — period. here's the 2018 american heart association guidelines. like he said,
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=111s)** — population studies suggest optimal total cholesterol levels are about 150. populations
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=117s)** — with cholesterol in this range manifest low rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=123s)** — nobody's saying it's the best marker but this is the opposite of what he's saying. i've read
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=126s)** — these guidelines, there's nothing in there about total cholesterol not associating, period.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=132s)** — maybe he saw something else and misunderstood it. is there anything in the description that he
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=138s)** — has a reference to? okay, two links to journals. that's good. american heart association journal,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=145s)** — that's probably it. let's click here. all right, sweet. um wait, this is scientific
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=153s)** — advisory for dietary cholesterol? no way, no way! don't tell me this guy's confusing... wow!
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=165s)** — yep, here's the passage he's referring to. oh my god. generally no significant association with
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=174s)** — cardiovascular disease risk. but this document is the scientific... this is the science advisory
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=180s)** — on dietary cholesterol. i think most people understand the difference but just in case.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=185s)** — all right, so that sounds a little bit staged but nevertheless he's absolutely correct. i did
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=190s)** — make a mistake. the american heart association did not say that but they did say that the
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=196s)** — dietary cholesterol is not associated with cardiovascular risk. however, if you take a look
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=202s)** — at this paper in 2018 entitled LDL cholesterol does not cause cardiovascular disease. a
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=210s)** — comprehensive review of the current literature under section 2. does high cholesterol cause
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=217s)** — atherosclerosis? and in summary no association between total cholesterol and degree of
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=225s)** — atherosclerosis. that's stuff that clogs up your arteries. so gill's point is correct.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=230s)** — american heart association did not say that but another paper did say that. so both dietary
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=236s)** — cholesterol and blood level cholesterol is not associated with cardiovascular risk. more
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=244s)** — on. particle size no longer predicts risk. it's just like the ashtray analogy. and they add two
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=251s)** — more lines of evidence. okay wait a second. let's go back to this for a second. saturated fats
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=256s)** — in cardiovascular health, current evidence and controversies. this is an editorial
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=262s)** — piece. it's not an actual study. it's someone talking about the data. and they add two more
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=268s)** — lines of evidence. statins which have a well-established effect of lowering risk
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=273s)** — preferentially reduce large ldl. and number two, patients with familial hypercholesterolemia
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=280s)** — which is a disease where people have very high cholesterol and very high risk of heart disease,
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=284s)** — they have mainly large ldls and they are at high risk indicating that large ldls are not
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=291s)** — benign. okay the next point he brings up which is rather a long explanation. i'm going
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=298s)** — summarize it because it gets into a lot of additional things which are a bit complex.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=303s)** — but basically the point i was making was that you have two different size particles
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=309s)** — with ldl. you have small dents and you have large buoyant. okay and i was making a point
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=317s)** — that the small dents were more pathological. they create more problems than the large buoyant
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=325s)** — and so then he shows several references that it's not true. they're both damaging especially if
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=331s)** — you look at the total concentration of ldls. if that's high, that's going to be a bigger
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=336s)** — problem. but there was two additional studies that i want to show you right now that
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=343s)** — came a little bit later than the one he posted. this one was originally published in 15
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=347s)** — february 2021. small dense low density lipoprotein. that would be the small dense
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=354s)** — ldl. cholesterol is the most atherogenic lipoprotein parameter in the prospective
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=362s)** — bramingham offspring study. in the conclusion it says our data indicate that small dense
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=368s)** — ldl is the most atherogenic lipoprotein parameter. and then there's one more study i
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=376s)** — showed in 2017. small dense low density lipoprotein. that's ldl. as biomarker for
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=384s)** — atherosclerotic diseases. so this is the conclusion. the results of the recent study
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=389s)** — demonstrate that ldl fractions. talking about the low dense versus the large buoyant. the two
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=397s)** — different particle sizes have different atherogenicity. that means ability to affect
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=403s)** — with the small dense ldl being more atherogenic than the large ldl sub fractions. small dense
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=412s)** — ldl is characterized by the enhanced ability to penetrate the arterial wall that makes
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=418s)** — it a potent source of cholesterol for the development of atherosclerotic plaque. importantly
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=426s)** — longer circulation times of small dense ldl result in multiple atherogenic modifications
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=433s)** — of small dense ldl particles in plasma. that's your blood. further increasing its
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=439s)** — atherogenicity. now they just mentioned why the small dense ldl is more pathogenic.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=445s)** — because it has the ability to penetrate the deeper walls. as well as having a longer
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=452s)** — circulation time. the longer that a small dense ldl is exposed to the arteries, it's going to
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=460s)** — create more problems. and there was some additional data that there's more oxidation
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=464s)** — going on with the small dense ldl than the large buoyant. okay, let's move to a different
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=469s)** — topic. one little thing that dr gill kept bringing up was this word we. he keeps saying,
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=478s)** — this or we're doing that. my first thought was, i thought you were an independent guy who just
- **[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=485s)** — basically is putting out the message and doing videos on various topics. it's not on his
- **[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=490s)** — youtube channel. i had to do a little searching. and i suspect it's a group that he's a member
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=494s)** — of. and of course i'm just guessing but that's the only group that i could find. so dr gill
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=499s)** — is a member or council member of an organization called true health initiative. so let's take a
- **[08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=505s)** — look at what this organization is. plant-based diets for reversing disease and saving the
- **[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=511s)** — planet. okay, so this is a plant-based organization. all right, let's go down to the bottom and
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=518s)** — take a look at the purpose of this organization and what they do. okay, changing policy,
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=524s)** — changing minds, improving lives. we are a global coalition of world-renowned experts
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=529s)** — fighting fake facts and combating false doubts about creating a world free of preventable diseases
- **[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=538s)** — using the time-honored evidence-based fundamentals of lifestyle as medicine. okay, so the whole
- **[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=545s)** — mission is to fight fake facts and combat false doubts. okay, all right. so that must
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=552s)** — be the organization that he's talking about when we're talking about we. if we scroll down
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=556s)** — we see no beef week challenge. okay, so this is definitely a vegan or vegetarian type
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=563s)** — group supporting the benefits of plant-based. let's take a look at their partners, the true
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=569s)** — health initiative partners. okay, we have no beef. so i can see very clearly they're against
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=574s)** — beef. now if you look at how many videos that i have on meat and beef, there's a lot. i
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=585s)** — actually am pro beef. right? i tell people to consume beef. now i see why this fact checking
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=589s)** — video was created. dr gill also did one on dr ekberg who also has the same philosophy
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=595s)** — because we're into the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. okay, so now it's all making a
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=600s)** — lot more sense. so dr gill, if you're watching, i just want to let you know i
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=605s)** — did participate in a study involving grass-fed beef and from farmers all over united states.
- **[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=612s)** — and they submitted their beef into this study. and it was a metabolomic study looking at all
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=619s)** — these metabolites and comparing grass-fed to grain-fed beef. okay, and about six months
- **[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=628s)** — after the study, the researcher called me up and said, what are you doing? i said, what do
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=634s)** — you mean? he says, take a look at this report. look at this first graph. total phytochemicals.
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=639s)** — phyto stands for plants. interesting. so you can clearly see the difference between the beef
- **[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=644s)** — that i submitted for this research project as far as the amount of phytochemicals, plant-based
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=651s)** — chemicals in the beef. and this was compared to other farmers who had grass-fed and compared
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=656s)** — to grain-fed. so this was the total phytochemicals. okay, if we scroll down,
- **[11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=662s)** — we'll take a look at a very specific phytochemical called hypirate, which is the major
- **[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=668s)** — polyphenol. these typically are antioxidant anti-inflammatory. and higher levels are
- **[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=673s)** — associated with improved gut microbial diversity and a lowered risk for metabolic syndrome in
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=678s)** — humans. here's another one that was significantly higher, which is an anti-inflammatory
- **[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=683s)** — metabolite. here's another one, antioxidant anti-inflammatory. and take a look at the fatty
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=688s)** — acid profile. we're looking at the omega-6 to omega-3 ratios. so a lower omega-6 to 3 ratio
- **[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=695s)** — is typically considered beneficial. lower levels means a higher abundance of omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=701s)** — here's another interesting finding, vitamin b3. quite a bit more than the other groups.
- **[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=705s)** — here's one that's a bit lower than the others, advanced glycation end products,
- **[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=710s)** — which is a major negative marker for health. here's another one, homocysteine.
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=715s)** — much lower than the other groups, which is a beneficial thing. and the reason i wanted to
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=720s)** — because so many times people lump in processed meat with grass-fed grass-finished beef. like
- **[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=728s)** — they're the same thing. they're not. and of course, there's not a tremendous amount of
- **[12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=731s)** — research in the area of grass-fed grass-finished, but that's coming using what's called
- **[12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=735s)** — metabolomic testing. so you could really see what's going on with these health markers.
- **[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=740s)** — because there is a difference in differentiating going to mcdonald's versus getting a really
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=746s)** — source of beef, which is filled with phytonutrients and a lot of other great things,
- **[12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=753s)** — including a lot of great bioavailable protein. so dr. gill, if you're watching,
- **[12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=757s)** — i just want to let you know there's a lot of positive things in beef that
- **[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=760s)** — personally i feel very healthy when i consume it. but i can see that i am a target for this
- **[12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=766s)** — organization for sure. all right, let's scroll down a little bit further on the true health
- **[12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=770s)** — initiative. we have beyond meat. all right, the truth about plant-based meats. okay, i see. so
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=778s)** — this is definitely supporting plant-based meats and alternative meats. okay. and if we do a
- **[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=784s)** — search on dr. gill's site, you have quite a few videos about imitation meats or beyond
- **[13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=791s)** — impossible burger, lab-grown meat. i have no idea what your thoughts are. i didn't watch
- **[13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=796s)** — but you definitely talk about these products. now the president of this organization,
- **[13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=802s)** — dr. david katz, is definitely not a fan of keto or any other diet that restricts entire food
- **[13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=809s)** — groups, calling them unhealthy or unsustainable. he said that keto is just a false label for
- **[13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=814s)** — some kind of diet that presumably restricts added sugar and refined carbohydrates, which
- **[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=819s)** — any good diet does. katz's low opinion on keto is echoed by many nutritional specialists

- **[17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1063s)** — the plant-based ones, they're all really nice and positive. so my question for gill and others
- **[17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1068s)** — who do like an anti-dr. burg videos is what diet do you recommend? you know, what should we be

- **[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1118s)** — but it's definitely mostly plant-based. and they want to put this out to the entire planet. so
- **[18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1123s)** — this is what it looks like. okay, here's the interesting thing about this diet. they're

- **[19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1152s)** — interesting. beef. we can have 30 calories per day. that comes out to a half of an ounce
- **[19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1158s)** — per day. that's like a little tiny bite. but we can have 284 calories from legumes,
- **[19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h81qq8Ne3go&t=1166s)** — okay? and 291 calories of nuts and 354 calories of unsaturated oils. would that be like
