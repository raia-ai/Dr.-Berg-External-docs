- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=0s)** — The shocking truth about protein bars. Protein bars are a huge industry. What's in the ingredients?
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=7s)** — Let's first start with an actual candy bar. And then we're going to do a comparison with all the
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=13s)** — healthy protein bars. Now if we take the Snickers bar, a 50 gram bar, 30 grams of carbs,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=19s)** — 25 grams of that is sugar. So basically we're talking about 58% of this bar is sugar. And
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=25s)** — you look at the first ingredient that makes up most of this bar. And the first ingredient is
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=30s)** — milk chocolate. The second is peanuts. And the third corn syrup. Pretty darn high in the
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=35s)** — glycemic index. Then we have actual sugar. And then it has salt, egg whites, palm oil,
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=41s)** — butter, skim milk, lactose, which is milk sugar, and peanuts. So that's what makes up
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=46s)** — a Snickers bar. Now remember that as we go through these protein bars, because somehow
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=52s)** — there's a perception that these protein bars are healthier than a candy bar. The first one I
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=57s)** — want to go through is this one right here. This is a Cliff bar. So this Cliff bar is 68 grams.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=64s)** — Okay, so it's a little more than the candy bar. And whereas the candy bar is 58% sugar,
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=70s)** — this one is merely 41% sugar. But they have virtually the same amount of carbohydrates,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=77s)** — except for the Cliff bar has like one more carbohydrate. So this is 31 grams of carbohydrate.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=83s)** — And there's three grams of fiber. So you deduct that and you get 28 net carbs. Okay,
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=89s)** — and then we have 17 grams of sugar. Wait a second. So if we have this total carbohydrate
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=95s)** — and we deduct the fiber and the sugar, we still have 11 grams of carbohydrate left.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=100s)** — So what is making up this 11 grams of carbohydrate? It's starches. Not like the
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=107s)** — typical starches in vegetables. The starches that turn into sugar so quick, they really
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=112s)** — are sugars. Because if you look at what starch is, it's just a chain of sugar molecules
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=117s)** — strung together. So this really doesn't have 17 grams of sugar. When we add the 11 grams
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=122s)** — of starch sugar, it really has 28 grams of sugar, which is seven teaspoons of sugar. But
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=129s)** — I want to know what type of sugar we're dealing with. Well, first one is cane syrup. Then we
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=136s)** — have brown rice syrup. There's some palm oil for the fat. And then here the starches. We
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=141s)** — have soy flour and rice flour. Now the big thing that people are going to look at when
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=146s)** — they look at the label is how much protein. Wow, 20 grams of protein. That's amazing.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=151s)** — Well, what's the quality of protein? Soy protein concentrate. That is a very low
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=158s)** — quality protein. So basically we have a lot of ultra processed ingredients in this product.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=162s)** — Okay, so that's the Cliff Builders bar. Now since you're talking about bars, protein bars,
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=166s)** — I want to mention an energy bar by Cliff. Okay, so we'll be talking about this one.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=172s)** — Maybe you've seen it in the grocery store. This bar is 68 grams. 55.88% of it is
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=181s)** — sugar. Now remember when I talked about sugar with this one, this one has 58% sugars. 58%?
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=188s)** — 56%. This is 43 grams of carbs, 5 grams of fiber, and 17 grams of sugar. Now wait a second,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=196s)** — we have something that's missing in these carbs, right? There's 21 grams of carbs that's
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=202s)** — unaccounted for. So what makes up the 21 grams of carbs that they're not talking about?
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=207s)** — Starches again. When you think starches, think sugar. So basically we're talking about 5.25
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=214s)** — teaspoons of extra sugar that's hidden as starches. So when you consume this,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=220s)** — you're consuming 9.5 teaspoons of sugar. And then if we look at the ingredient, we have oats,
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=226s)** — organic brown rice syrup, soy rice crisps, which is soy protein isolates, and rice flour,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=236s)** — organic tapioca syrup, organic cane syrup, and also the chicory fiber, organic soy flour,
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=243s)** — and the soy oil. So we're dealing with a lot of starches, a lot of sugars, and then some
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=248s)** — seed oil. I'm going to tell you right now, if you consume this, you're not going to have
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=252s)** — sustainable energy. You're going to have some little bit of spike in energy and then you're
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=255s)** — going to crash and burn and you're going to end up with low blood sugars. If you have a very
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=260s)** — fast metabolism and you're exercising, you might be able to deal with it, but I know I would not
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=265s)** — be able to deal with this bar right here. All right, now let's go to the Kine bar. And it
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=270s)** — says the number one ingredient is heart-healthy peanuts. It says on the back, low glycemic
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=277s)** — index, dairy-free, no GMO, very low sodium, no sugar alcohols, zero trans fats, and a good
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=286s)** — source of fiber. Let's see if any of this is actually true. The first thing you need to know
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=290s)** — is this is a 40 gram bar and if we look at the percentage of sugar, it's 37.5% of it is sugar.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=297s)** — What type of sugar? Well, if we get beyond the first ingredient, which is peanuts,
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=302s)** — second ingredient is glucose syrup. Glucose syrup is not low on the glycemic index. Then
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=308s)** — sugar, then honey, then palm oil, then the soy protein isolate, and they throw in the chicory
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=314s)** — Your perception of healthy protein bars might be changing. Don't worry, it gets worse.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=321s)** — Okay, the next one I want to talk about is the Quest bars. Okay, the Quest bars. In one of
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=327s)** — these bars, we have 60 grams. And by the way, this is 41% sugar in this bar right here. So
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=334s)** — we have 25 grams of carbs. We have 12 grams of fiber and 9 grams of sugar alcohols. Now
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=340s)** — if you are going to consume 9 grams of sugar alcohols, you're going to have a lot of GI
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=346s)** — problems, a lot of gas, a lot of bloating, maybe some diarrhea. The first ingredient is
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=350s)** — a protein blend, then polydextrose, then water, erythritol, then we get almonds,
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=355s)** — then palm oil, then we have another ingredient called sodium caseinate. It says it's a high
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=359s)** — quality protein, which I disagree with. And then they add a type of sweetener, sucralose,
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=364s)** — milk protein isolate, and whey protein isolate. And they also have this other ingredient,
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=370s)** — polydextrose. Again, we don't know what's going to happen when your good bacteria try to deal
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=375s)** — with it or ferment it. We don't have the long-term safety studies. So right now we're
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=380s)** — doing kind of a human experiment to find out how this affects people. And apparently,
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=385s)** — you are the guinea pig. Now let's get into this one right here called pure protein. When
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=394s)** — 100% of this is protein, in theory, but in reality it's not true. It has 20 grams of protein,
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=403s)** — 2 grams of sugar, and let's take a look at what is in here. It's like 50 grams of product.
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=410s)** — So we have 17 grams of carbohydrate, 1 gram of fiber, but only 2 grams of sugar.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=416s)** — What's left? Starches. Out of all the carbohydrates, 14 grams of that is starch.
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=422s)** — Basically, we're throwing in 4 more teaspoons of sugar and they're hidden as starches. So you
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=429s)** — don't notice it on the label. 34% of the pure protein is sugar. Let's talk about the ingredients.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=436s)** — What's in here? Sugar. We have tapioca starch and we also have sucralose,
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=440s)** — multitol syrup, plus they add multitol. It's not low on the glycemic index and they put
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=446s)** — a lot of sugar-free candy and it's the worst sugar alcohol. And of course, the type of protein
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=452s)** — that is in this pure protein product is, you guessed it, soy protein isolate. The cheapest,
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=459s)** — worst type of protein you can consume. All right, next one we're going to talk about
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=464s)** — is this one called One. This one has 20 grams of protein, 1 gram of sugar. Wow,
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=470s)** — sounds pretty good. There's 60 grams of product in this bar and there's 25 grams of carbs,
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=477s)** — 8 grams of fiber, but 6 grams of sugar alcohols. That's quite high. If we look at
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=481s)** — the ingredients, we have this darn multitol again, rice flour, and tapioca starch.
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=486s)** — The type of protein is going to be milk protein some way. And then they add in this
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=492s)** — soluble vegetable fiber, isomalt, oligosaccharide, it's sugar, and then
- **[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=497s)** — oil, which is seed oil, polydextrose, cellulose, which is basically sawdust or wood pulp.
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=503s)** — And then again, the sugar that they're using is sucralose, a low quality artificial
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=507s)** — sugar. 41% of this product is sugar, but probably more because of the isomalt, oligosaccharide.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=516s)** — Try to say that three times. Now we have something called Metrex or RX. It's a meal
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=522s)** — replacement. So this is not necessarily a protein bar, but even though it has 30
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=526s)** — grams of protein, maybe it is a protein bar, but they advertise it as a meal replacement.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=531s)** — You can just take this without having to eat. It has 100 grams of product, 30 grams of protein,
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=539s)** — 17 vitamins and minerals, 48 grams of carbs, okay? One gram of fiber and 29 grams of sugar.
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=548s)** — What explains the big gap? If you guessed starches, you are correct. It does have four
- **[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=552s)** — grams of sugar alcohol, 15 grams of rice starch, which is really equivalent to about four teaspoons
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=559s)** — of actual sugar. Now the sugar alcohols is the maltitol syrup. Again, they're corn syrup,
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=565s)** — fructose, soy protein isolate. They throw some whey in there, some milk, some egg whites.
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=571s)** — And this also contains something called bioengineered food ingredients. They don't want
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=576s)** — use the word GMO anymore. This right here is 48% sugar. Then we have this one is called AMRX
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=585s)** — bar. First thing it says is 10 grams of protein, three tablespoons of oats. Sounds healthy.
- **[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=590s)** — Five cashews. That's healthy. Two egg whites. Wow, that's great. Two teaspoons of honey.
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=595s)** — Best form of sweetener. No BS. Now let's make sure that there's nothing else in here,
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=602s)** — because this gives the appearance that there are only these ingredients on here.
- **[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=607s)** — Well, almonds, blueberries, pumpkin seeds, brown rice. Brown rice? Why are they putting
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=613s)** — that in there? High oleic sunflower oil. What is that? That might sound like a healthier
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=618s)** — seed oil, but it's still highly processed. Then we have coconut sugar, oat fiber,
- **[10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=625s)** — and sea salt. 52.73% of this is sugar. A lot of these bars are comparable to
- **[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=636s)** — a candy bar. Now if we were to compare all these bars and and try to pick out the worst
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=641s)** — one, my pick would be this one right here being the worst one. And the reason for that
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=646s)** — is not just the that's 41% sugar, which is a big problem, but there's also some hidden
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=652s)** — and some things that are really going to mess up your blood sugars. Things that are
- **[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=656s)** — camouflaged as fiber, but are really sugars. So there's really nothing in here
- **[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=661s)** — that is healthy at all. At least some of these bars have some good ingredients in them,
- **[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=668s)** — but I couldn't really find anything in this one. So tell me what you think about
- **[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=672s)** — these protein bars. And if you found a bar that actually is healthy, please comment down
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=677s)** — below. I've been looking. I just haven't found any. Now since protein is the main
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=682s)** — theme of this video, if you have not seen this video on one of the best protein sources,
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYi3yIiMig&t=688s)** — you should check it out. I put it up right here.
