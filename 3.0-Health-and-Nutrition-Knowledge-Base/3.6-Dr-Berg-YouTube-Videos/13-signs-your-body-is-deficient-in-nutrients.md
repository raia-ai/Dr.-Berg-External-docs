- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=0s)** — Okay, we are at the last video. Let's tie everything together.
- **[00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=2s)** — Our goal is to get you to one meal a day.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=6s)** — That way you fast for the entire 23 hours and then have that last meal.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=12s)** — And you can spread that meal, you know, maybe for two hours.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=15s)** — But the point is that this will allow you to really spike that growth hormone
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=19s)** — to the extreme... to tap into some serious fat loss. Okay?
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=24s)** — So we are going to do 5% of your calories carbs. So it's like 20 grams or less.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=29s)** — We already covered what to eat.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=31s)** — And then 9 ounces of protein. Maybe it's going to be 8.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=34s)** — But realize we need... we don't want too much.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=37s)** — But then again, we don't want a deficiency of protein because your body,
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=41s)** — even though it recycles it, it's definitely something that
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=46s)** — we need to build the proteins that build the hair, the nails, the skin and all that.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=50s)** — So we need some protein. High quality. More fatty, if possible.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=55s)** — Healthy fats. We talked about that.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=57s)** — In the beginning, you're going to need a little bit more.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=59s)** — And as you do this, you need a little less because your body is adapted.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=63s)** — The way that you know you're adapted is you crave nothing anymore.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=67s)** — It's amazing. You have no cravings. And also you're not hungry nearly as much.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=72s)** — Okay? Compound exercise. You want to add that in when you can.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=77s)** — You want to gradually go into it. I do recommend a personal trainer.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=80s)** — Compound exercise is working multiple muscle groups.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=83s)** — I like to start with your own body weight for a period of months,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=86s)** — maybe even a year until you can start adding weights.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=89s)** — But working the full body, higher intensity with lots of rest in between,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=93s)** — will just... it's the icing on the cake.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=95s)** — I'm not going to talk about cake right now, but it's the meat and potatoes of...
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=99s)** — now I'm not going to mention potatoes, sorry.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=102s)** — We just want to do this to increase and maximize even more growth hormone.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=107s)** — Okay? Compound exercise. Twice a week.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=111s)** — Give your time to recover between that and spread it out.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=114s)** — Ideally it'd be Monday and Friday. That would be awesome.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=116s)** — Or maybe Tuesday and Friday. Something like that.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=119s)** — Sleep. Work on the sleep.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=121s)** — If you have problems sleeping, get this right here.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=124s)** — This is what I take. Take one of these 15 minutes before you go to bed
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=127s)** — and you will just go, bam, go to sleep. So that's sleep aid.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=131s)** — Okay? So you can do that.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=133s)** — That's going to enhance more growth hormone.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=135s)** — Growth hormone is triggered by quality sleep, exercise, and low carbs.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=142s)** — Then the nutrients. So we want more potassium, B1, B5, magnesium, and trace minerals.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=149s)** — All of these are really key to lowering insulin and improving insulin resistance.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=156s)** — A lot of people are using this right here in my electrolytes.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=158s)** — And this has the potassium and a thousand milligrams of magnesium.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=162s)** — It has the trace minerals. Okay? Trace minerals like zinc and chromium,
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=168s)** — which actually help the cells that make insulin.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=170s)** — That will actually help you right there.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=172s)** — And there's also something else I have. It's called nutritional yeast tablets.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=176s)** — That's in my keto kit. So you might want to check it out. I put a link down below.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=180s)** — But that way you get all the B vitamins. So everything is smooth. You have the minerals.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=184s)** — And then it comes with this too, the raw wheatgrass juice.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=188s)** — And this basically will help in the calc shake, give you extra nutrients.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=192s)** — And it comes with the book. Okay?
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=195s)** — Last thing is the outside of vinegar. Make sure you consume that with a meal.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=198s)** — So your stomach is really, really acidic and you can digest the protein.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=202s)** — It's going to make a big difference with blood sugars. Okay?
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aUWIBf2VE&t=206s)** — All right. So you made it. So the next step is to get started and send me your success stories.
