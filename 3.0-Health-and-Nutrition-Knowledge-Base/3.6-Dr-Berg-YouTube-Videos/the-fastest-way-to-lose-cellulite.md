- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=0s)** — I'd like to share with you on how to pull yourself out of any stressful situation extremely quick.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=8s)** — You can also definitely use this if you're struggling to sleep at night or you're trying
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=12s)** — to go to sleep but you have too much stress. But I'm going to show you a technique that's
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=16s)** — completely free. It's very simple. It's very quick and it has many many benefits. It's the
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=22s)** — fastest thing that I know of to put you in a calm state. It can actually even help increase
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=26s)** — your DHEA which is kind of the precursor for all of your adrenal hormones. It has been shown to
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=32s)** — improve immune defense and increase oxytocin which is kind of like the they call it the love
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=37s)** — hormone or the hormone that helps you bond with another. And it's a major pleasure hormone too.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=43s)** — It can help lower your blood pressure, decrease your pulse rate and increase something
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=47s)** — called alpha wave brain waves which will help you feel attentive, calm and totally relaxed.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=54s)** — It'll also support your neurotransmitters specifically dopamine and serotonin.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=58s)** — Basically it will put you in a state of parasympathetic balance. Okay. The parasympathetic
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=65s)** — nervous system is part of the autonomic nervous system and it is the thing that is
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=71s)** — called rest and digest. It is the mode where your body gets into that help calm down that
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=77s)** — sympathetic nervous system. And this is based on a recent book that I'm reading called Heart
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=83s)** — Coherence 365. And let me explain what that means that heart coherence. It's a fancy word for
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=90s)** — synchronizing your heart to your emotions, your heart to your brain. And there's quite a bit of
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=96s)** — science behind this but it's basically a simple breathing technique to put you in a state of
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=102s)** — peace and calmness that will help you sleep and help you rest and do a lot of other cool
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=108s)** — 365. Okay. Three means three times a day. Six means six breaths per minute. And so you're
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=118s)** — going to slow down your breaths a little bit. And five indicates five minutes. So basically you
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=124s)** — have this certain pattern of breathing which is six repetitions per minute. And you're going
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=129s)** — to do that for five minutes three times a day. So that's the simplicity of it. Okay.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=133s)** — So apparently the research that's done on this wavelength that you're creating this
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=138s)** — wave of breathing pattern creates some really amazing things to your nervous system. In fact,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=144s)** — you probably already have learned this from other videos that I've done but this makes it
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=148s)** — really really simple. And I like the book because he gives the science behind it. And
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=151s)** — of course I'm going to just add one little thing which will make sense. So you have to
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=156s)** — make sure that it's controlled breathing. You have to make sure that it's deep and it's even.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=161s)** — And then you want to breathe through your stomach. So you just kind of stick it out and in so you
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=166s)** — can have a nice deep breath using your diaphragm. But also I'm going to add my own
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=170s)** — little two cents to this. I want you to breathe through your nose because that way you'll get
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=174s)** — a little bit more CO2 to extract more oxygen. And what's interesting is you need CO2
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=179s)** — to allow oxygen to penetrate deeper into the cells. So this really sounds just so simple and
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=185s)** — it's like almost... can it really do that? But oh my goodness. I mean there's been many times
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=191s)** — where in the middle of the night I'll wake up for some reason and start to think about something
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=196s)** — or some stress. And then I will start breathing. Slowing it down, breathing in, breathing out. And
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=202s)** — it pulls me right out of that stress. Allows me to go back to sleep. Also getting to sleep
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=207s)** — at night. You can start doing this breathing. Keeping very even in and out six cycles per
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=213s)** — minute. That can help you get to sleep. And there's a really cool device called HRV,
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=219s)** — heart rate variability, that I hopefully at the time you're watching this have some more
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=223s)** — information about. I'll put a link down below. To basically measure where you are on the heart
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=227s)** — rate variability, which has a lot to do with these two systems. The sympathetic and the
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=234s)** — parasympathetic. So you have a tool to measure where you're at and then you can
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=239s)** — improve it over time. Because this breathing technique is one of the things that will
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=245s)** — increase HRV, which is heart rate variability, which has a lot to do with your health reserve
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=251s)** — and your fitness reserve. Now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBMXA3ynFU&t=256s)** — on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's a lot of content that I
