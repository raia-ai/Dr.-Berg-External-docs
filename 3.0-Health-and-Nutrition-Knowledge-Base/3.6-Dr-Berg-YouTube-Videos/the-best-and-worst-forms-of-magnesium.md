- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=0s)** — I'd like to discuss the first sign of a magnesium deficiency. Did you realize that 68% of people
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=7s)** — in the United States don't get the required amounts of magnesium from their diet? Now,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=13s)** — not to mention all the other foods and things and drugs and things that people are exposed
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=17s)** — to that deplete magnesium. Magnesium is a cofactor involved in 350 different enzymes.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=25s)** — What's a cofactor? A cofactor is something that is required by an enzyme for that enzyme to work.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=33s)** — And I'm not just talking about digestive enzymes. I'm talking about enzymes that make up all your
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=37s)** — biochemistry that do all the bodily functions. The other thing about a magnesium deficiency is
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=43s)** — many times a potassium deficiency has very similar symptoms. So it is difficult to determine
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=52s)** — if you have a magnesium deficiency or a potassium deficiency. But the good news is they both come
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=59s)** — from vegetables and salads. So as long as you're eating those, you're going to be totally fine.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=64s)** — But before I get into the number one most common symptom, let me go through some other
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=68s)** — symptoms. Cramping, twitching, which could also come from other things as well, like
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=74s)** — your pH being too alkaline. Arrhythmias of the heart. The heart starts skipping because
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=80s)** — of a lack of magnesium. Mainly because magnesium works with calcium. Magnesium helps remove too
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=87s)** — much calcium from the cell, helping this over-contracted vasoconstricted artery,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=95s)** — lowering your blood pressure. Now, as far as your bone health, people think calcium to
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=100s)** — prevent osteoporosis, but magnesium is just as important. And osteomalacia, which is a
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=110s)** — rickets because magnesium is essential for vitamin D activation. You can't activate vitamin D without
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=119s)** — magnesium. Insulin resistance, and I've talked about this in many other videos, has a related
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=125s)** — magnesium deficiency usually. And this is why when you increase magnesium, you start to make
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=130s)** — insulin more sensitive and it starts to work. And of course, insomnia. If you don't have enough,
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=135s)** — you'll have a tendency to not be able to sleep. And also low magnesium can raise cortisol. And of
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=140s)** — course, your mood is dependent on magnesium too. If you're deficient in magnesium, you may find
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=145s)** — that you're a bit on the depressed side. So what is the number one symptom of a magnesium
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=150s)** — deficiency? It is fatigue. Now, so many people have fatigue and maybe you right now are sitting
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=156s)** — right there and you're tired, right? A lot of people are tired. It could be as simple as not
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=160s)** — getting enough magnesium. And I do want to mention what foods to eat for magnesium because
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=164s)** — that's ultimately the best way to get your magnesium. But let me just dive into why people
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=170s)** — get tired because they don't have enough magnesium. Remember I mentioned that magnesium
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=176s)** — is necessary for 350 different enzymes. Well, a lot of those enzymes are in the
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=182s)** — mitochondria and specifically the creation of ATP. ATP is the energy currency that the body
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=190s)** — uses to power all the different functions. And magnesium powers something else that I talked
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=198s)** — about in other videos, the sodium potassium pumps. These are the little pumps in every single
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=204s)** — cell that power your muscles to work and your nervous system to work. That little pump
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=211s)** — creates the voltage because your cells are like batteries. Well, guess what? Magnesium provides
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=215s)** — the energy to allow for that pump to pump. So this is why you might have cramps. There's just
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=221s)** — not enough power to allow that sodium potassium pump to work in the muscles. And things start
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=228s)** — shutting down and you cramp. This is why the electricity cannot be traveled through the pacemaker
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=235s)** — of your heart correctly. And if that can't work, you start getting arrhythmias or palpitations
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=240s)** — or your heart starts to skip because you don't have the energy because there's no magnesium
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=244s)** — to power that sodium potassium pump in the nervous system. Magnesium is also needed to
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=250s)** — make proteins, protein synthesis. Also needed to make DNA and RNA, the building blocks
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=256s)** — of everything. Now, most people are deficient because they're just not eating
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=260s)** — enough of the right food to prevent this problem. And the food that will give you the
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=265s)** — most magnesium is leafy greens, vegetables, big salads. The cool thing it will also give you
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=274s)** — at a restaurant or at home and you have this little side salad that's just like
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=280s)** — one cup. It's just not going to be enough. You need to beef up your salads, no pun intended,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=286s)** — to the point where if you're doing like two meals a day, I would say, you know, have like
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=290s)** — five cups or just get it out of the way and eat like seven cups of salad just one time a
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=297s)** — day. Now, ideally, if you go a little bit more, it's a little bit better. But I think you
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=301s)** — should work on a nice gradual increase in your salad. But the point is that most people don't
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=307s)** — consume enough salad, even associates, friends, family members around myself. I see what they're
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=313s)** — eating and they just don't have enough salad. So when I go to a social activity and they
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=318s)** — bring out the meals, right, they have a big salad bowl and you'll put your salad on the
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=323s)** — plate with all the other food. Now, you need an extra bowl in addition to your plate to
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=329s)** — put that huge salad. Of course, I'm usually the only one that does that in my circles. But the
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=335s)** — point is that I don't have any arrhythmias. I don't get any cramps. I have tons of energy
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=340s)** — because I have enough magnesium. If you don't do that or can't do that, well, definitely
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=344s)** — start using a supplement. I would recommend magnesium glycinate. It's a good one. But there's
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=350s)** — three types of magnesium I would not recommend. Okay, the magnesium oxide, the magnesium
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=357s)** — hydroxide, and the magnesium carbonate. Those might be okay maybe as a laxative, but other than
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=365s)** — that, I wouldn't take them because they're not very absorbable. The other ways that people are
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=368s)** — deficient are they eat too many refined foods, especially fructose, which is in table sugar.
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=375s)** — It's in honey. It's in high fructose corn syrup. It's in a lot of other things as well. But
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=379s)** — fructose can deplete magnesium. Alcohol. And what is alcohol made from? Sugar. The more inflammation
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=385s)** — you have, the less magnesium you're going to have in your body. If you want to know a good biomarker
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=390s)** — on a blood test for a magnesium deficiency, look at something called C-reactive protein. That's an
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=397s)** — inflammatory biomarker and it usually means that you need more magnesium. Also certain
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=403s)** — medications like especially diuretics can create a magnesium deficiency as well as antibiotics.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=408s)** — When you have this alteration in your microbiome, probably from a combination of
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=414s)** — what happens is there's a certain thing that will start binding up and locking up a lot of
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=419s)** — magnesium. And a lot of people start developing musculoskeletal issues like fibromyalgia,
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=426s)** — painful trigger points, a lot of muscular problems because you need magnesium for that
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lSQ2hnycLg&t=432s)** — normal relaxation phase of the contraction and relaxation cycle. Now, if you wanted a
