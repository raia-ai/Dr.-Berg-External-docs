- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=0s)** — The health benefits of certain mushrooms are quite mind-blowing. So today I'm going to take
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=7s)** — some of the confusions that people have about mushrooms and just make it really, really simple.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=12s)** — So if you have a very specific health problem, you'll know exactly what to take. Now I'm going
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=18s)** — to primarily focus on four different types of mushrooms, okay? But they're in the family of
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=24s)** — okay, or fungi. And fungi is very interesting because there is more related DNA-wise to a fungus
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=32s)** — than there is to plants. In other words, like plants have photosynthesis, so they actually
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=38s)** — breathe in CO2 and they make oxygen. Well, mushrooms, which is a type of fungus, don't do
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=44s)** — that. They breathe in oxygen and release CO2, very similar to humans. They actually share
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=51s)** — 50% of their DNA, which basically means they have certain blueprints that make certain
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=58s)** — chemicals that we can use for the benefit of our own health. Fungi is the largest and oldest
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=67s)** — organism on planet Earth. In fact, in just one handful of soil from the forest, you have
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=74s)** — literally 26 miles of a certain type of fungi called mycelium. So there is a tremendous amount
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=82s)** — of fungus working in the soil with the roots of plants, exchanging different nutrients to make
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=87s)** — sure that plant has the nutrients that it needs and getting certain sugars from the plants
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=92s)** — as their food. And so really it's a fungus that mobilize the minerals in the soil. And so
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=98s)** — without this fungus, the plant really has a hard time getting nutrition. Fungus is also
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=101s)** — responsible for breaking things down like organic matter, trees, wood, leaves, etc. So they are the
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=109s)** — great recyclers. But today we're going to talk about four key mushrooms that you need to know
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=114s)** — about. I want to make it really, really simple for you. The first one is the reishi mushroom.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=119s)** — Okay, this mushroom could be thought of as a natural Xanax. Now, of course, I'm not promoting
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=125s)** — medication, but this is the natural version without the side effects. And what does that
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=129s)** — medication do? It's purported to help you with anxiety and helping you calm down. Therefore,
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=135s)** — it's also good for sleep. If you want to increase your tolerance to stress, if you want to
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=139s)** — counter stress and cortisol, this mushroom might be a good one to add to your diet.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=145s)** — The next one is lion's mane. Okay, because it looks like a lion's mane. This one could be
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=150s)** — considered like a natural Adderall, but without the side effects. What is that drug? Well,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=155s)** — it's used for people with cognitive problems, attention deficit issues. A lot of college
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=162s)** — students take it to increase their learning abilities because it kind of speeds up the
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=168s)** — central nervous system to a certain degree. Of course, it has a lot of side effects.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=173s)** — But lion's mane is specifically good for cognitive function, improving focus, concentration,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=182s)** — memory. A lot of people take it as a coffee replacement in the morning. But it has some
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=189s)** — really interesting benefits in repairing and regenerating nerve tissue and myelin sheath
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=195s)** — around the nerve. It has something called the neurotrophic factor, which just helps support
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=201s)** — nerve growth in general, specifically in the area of the brain called the hippocampus, which
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=206s)** — is involved with cognitive function to a certain degree. This mushroom also has been known to
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=212s)** — increase something called BDNF, brain derived neurotrophic factor. That's kind of like miracle
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=219s)** — grow, but for your brain. So it helps the nerves grow. So when you think about lion's mane,
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=224s)** — think cognitive improvements and anything related to a breakdown in your brain,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=231s)** — like neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=236s)** — dementia. Then we have the shiitake mushroom. That mushroom is good for blood pressure. It's
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=243s)** — really beneficial for your gut microbiome. A good portion of our immune system is in the gut.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=249s)** — And shiitake mushroom can actually increase the killer T cells, which are responsible for
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=255s)** — killing viruses. And the last one, which I think is the most interesting, is the turkey
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=259s)** — mushroom. This one has been researched the most. When you think of turkey tail, you want to think
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=265s)** — of anti-cancer properties. But as far as turkey tail goes, I would recommend anyone who has
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=272s)** — cancer to start taking it immediately. It has a non-specific immune modulating action, which
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=279s)** — basically strengthen the immune system overall. So if someone is on chemo or radiation,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=286s)** — turkey tail is great to take against cancer. The white blood cells actually eat certain
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=292s)** — compounds in this mushroom, like beta-glucans, and consume it, carry it into the lymphatic system
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=299s)** — to help cause the cancer cell to commit suicide. That's called apoptosis. A normal cell would
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=305s)** — basically kill itself as a kind of a greater good for the body. But a cancer cell basically
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=312s)** — lives forever. Now, turkey tail also reduces inflammation in your gut, which is also related
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=318s)** — to your immune system as well. Because if you think about cancer, cancer tends to spread into
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=323s)** — areas of inflammation. All right, so reishi is good as a natural xanax for calming down
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=328s)** — the fight or fight mechanism or cortisol. Then we have lion's mane, which is everything to do
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=333s)** — with cognitive function, helping you concentrate, helping you focus. Then we have shiitake,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=339s)** — which is three things, cholesterol, blood pressure, and your immune system. And then we
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=344s)** — have turkey tail, which it has a potent anti-cancer effect. All right, so I hope I gave you some
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=350s)** — clarity on what these mushrooms are good for. And so the next time you have a certain problem,
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=355s)** — you'll know exactly what mushroom to take or eat. Since I mentioned cancer and a good remedy
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=361s)** — for that, if you have not seen this video on cancer, it would be very, very smart to watch it.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx03S_u50mo&t=368s)** — I put that video up right here.
