- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=0s)** — I want to give you a really important recommendation to take at dinner time to help you get into the most wonderful deep restorative sleep.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=8s)** — Now, for years I've suffered with a sleep problem. It pretty much started after basic training when I was forced to wake up at four o'clock every morning for three months.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=17s)** — And after that somehow my body was trained. I could not sleep past four o'clock for many years, so I would just go to bed early.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=24s)** — But I was still only getting about six to six and a half hours of sleep for years. And I would always just cope by napping and try to get more sleep.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=34s)** — But it wasn't until I got eight hours of consistent day after day sleep that I discovered for myself how important this sleep is.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=44s)** — Now, if we dissect your sleep, we have several situations. We have people that can't get the sleep.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=49s)** — There's people that get up through the night and have to urinate very frequently. Sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=55s)** — Every single one of those problems I just mentioned can be resolved by this one remedy. And that is vitamin D.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=64s)** — Usually you cannot fix your sleep by taking regular amounts of vitamin D.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=68s)** — In fact, if you look at some of the studies that don't show that vitamin D can help your sleep, they're just using very, very tiny amounts.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=75s)** — You know, people are concerned with the toxic effect of vitamin D, but there's a way to counter that very easily.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=82s)** — Also, vitamin D can fix a lot of problems in your gut, believe it or not. Not to mention all the different connections with vitamin D in your immune system.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=91s)** — Vitamin D also works with magnesium. Those two are kind of partners in their ability to work together.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=97s)** — And magnesium is behind all sorts of problems with cramping, heart palpitations, restless leg syndrome, high levels of cortisol, which prevent your sleep.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=108s)** — And a lot of people sleep better when they take magnesium before you go to sleep.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=112s)** — But if you have a restless leg syndrome or cramps and you're taking magnesium and it's not working, it could be because you need more vitamin D.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=120s)** — And then we get into the powerful effect that vitamin D has with inflammation. It's one of the most powerful anti-inflammatories.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=127s)** — And also when you sleep better, your blood sugar will be better. If we take a look at all the things that can improve your health, we have diet, exercise, sleep.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=138s)** — I think sleep is at the top of the list. You're basically the circadian rhythms of your body that's controlled by a little bundle of nerves deep in your brain in the hypothalamus.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=148s)** — There's receptors for vitamin D in that nerve bundle.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=152s)** — And this is why, for example, when you get jet lag and it throws off your rhythm, the antidote is vitamin D.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=160s)** — An obese person needs three times as much vitamin D as a thin person because vitamin D gets diluted. The same thing with the diabetic. The same thing as you age.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=171s)** — Now, if you get your vitamin D tested and you can even buy these little kits that measure your vitamin D, and I'll put a link down below of the company that I use.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=180s)** — I buy the kit, I measure my own vitamin D, and when you get the results, if it's below 40 nanograms per milliliter, you're going to have all sorts of issues.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=190s)** — You need levels that are like 70, 80, 90, or even 100, or even a little bit more to create a therapeutic benefit.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=199s)** — Vitamin D is not really a vitamin. It's a hormone.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=202s)** — And so if you're focused on taking vitamin D to get this hormone to work better, realize that the type of vitamin D that they test in your blood is the inactive version.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=213s)** — It doesn't really tell you conclusively if you're getting the vitamin D in the cells.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=220s)** — There's a lot of people who have vitamin D resistance who need to take a lot more vitamin D to penetrate that resistance.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=227s)** — I would recommend taking at least 30,000 IUs of vitamin D3 for a period of time to start to elevate the vitamin D that you need therapeutically to create an effect on your sleep.
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=241s)** — I take 50,000 IUs every single day. But this is very important.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=246s)** — I drink at least two and a half liters of water every single day to prevent any type of side effect from this toxicity, which is the calcium issue, calcium in the blood.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=257s)** — That's really the only side effect. So if you just maybe cut down on the dairy and you drink more water and you take all the cofactors.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=264s)** — So I always take vitamin D with vitamin K2. Very important.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=270s)** — That prevents the calcium from building up in the blood. And then I also take magnesium.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=274s)** — I take zinc as a cofactor. I take vitamin B6 as a cofactor.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=281s)** — Now a couple additional things that I'm going to recommend. If you're trying to sleep, it's best to take that vitamin D with the cofactors at the last meal of the day.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=290s)** — You're going to get more absorption that way. Now, some people that take vitamin D before bed, it wakes them up.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=297s)** — And I really think it's because they're not taking the cofactors, magnesium, zinc, B6, K2.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=303s)** — I would make sure that the temperature of your room is slightly cooler. That seems to help me. I crack the window open.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=310s)** — I would also make sure that about two hours before you go to sleep, you're not exposed to like your cell phones and bright lights.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=317s)** — Start dimming down the room with the lights. Now, since this vitamin D toxicity idea comes up so often, you should probably get a little more information on that.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf_z1OSYxmk&t=328s)** — And I've created a video just for you. Check it out.
