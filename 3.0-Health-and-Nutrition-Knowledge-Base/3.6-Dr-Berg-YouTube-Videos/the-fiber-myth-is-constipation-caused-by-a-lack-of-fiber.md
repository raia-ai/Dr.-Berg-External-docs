- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=0s)** — Now we all know for a fact that if you have constipation,
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=4s)** — you just need to add more fiber.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=6s)** — Okay? I mean it's the general consensus of the medical community that
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=10s)** — a lack of fiber is really what's behind constipation.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=14s)** — Well, today let's just talk about
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=15s)** — what the number one mistake is with constipation
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=19s)** — and then some additional things that you need to know
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=21s)** — if you have constipation.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=23s)** — Let's just take a look at constipation for a second.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=25s)** — It's a traffic jam in your gut, right?
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=27s)** — It's congestion.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=30s)** — You have too much stool.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=32s)** — Now, fiber increases bulk.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=36s)** — Okay? It increases stool.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=40s)** — It increases volume.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=42s)** — So just by looking at that, why would you ever want to
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=45s)** — increase more volume or mass or bulk
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=50s)** — into a tube or plumbing that's already congested?
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=55s)** — That does not make sense to me.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=57s)** — Also, think about what fiber does.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=60s)** — It causes your microbes to create fermentation.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=64s)** — With fermentation comes gas and bloating.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=68s)** — Usually people that have constipation
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=70s)** — don't need any more gas or bloating.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=72s)** — The other point about people that are chronically constipated
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=75s)** — is that they're already doing a lot of fiber,
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=78s)** — but it's not working.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=80s)** — So to add more fiber is not a good idea.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=83s)** — There's some fascinating studies
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=86s)** — with people who have both chronic constipation
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=89s)** — and people who have constipation with
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=93s)** — irritable bowel syndrome or some other type of
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=95s)** — inflammatory condition that adding more fiber
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=97s)** — will make it worse.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=99s)** — That's right.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=99s)** — If you have SIBO, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth,
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=106s)** — which is... your microbes are in the wrong place.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=108s)** — They're in the small intestine. Okay?
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=110s)** — They should be in the large intestine.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=112s)** — So they're higher up.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=114s)** — And you consume more fiber.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=116s)** — Oh my goodness.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=117s)** — You're going to get bloating.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=118s)** — It's going to make things really, really bad.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=120s)** — So the biggest mistake that people make
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=123s)** — for constipation is adding more fiber.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=126s)** — In fact, I used to have very, very bad constipation.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=129s)** — And by accident, I got rid of it.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=131s)** — It was at the time when I kind of stumbled on
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=135s)** — cutting out carbs.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=137s)** — And so I was doing a lot of grain carbs
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=140s)** — as my fiber for cereal and things like that.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=142s)** — When I switched to eating more like meats,
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=146s)** — like a buffalo burger, even fish for breakfast,
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=150s)** — all my constipation completely went away.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=152s)** — And it was like I was dumbfounded because I'm like,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=155s)** — I just thought I had to add more menomucil
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=157s)** — or other types of fiber.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=159s)** — But every time I did that, it got worse.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=162s)** — But it was really bizarre just to eat more meat
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=165s)** — and find that my constipation completely cleared up.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=168s)** — But at the time, I didn't really know why.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=170s)** — So instead of adding more fiber,
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=172s)** — just omit the fiber.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=174s)** — So no more want to reduce your fiber.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=175s)** — Now, of course, I just want to differentiate
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=178s)** — two different types of fiber.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=180s)** — Vegetable fiber is usually okay,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=182s)** — but even that sometimes can bind you up.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=185s)** — But the most likely reason for people
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=188s)** — having a worsening with more fiber is the grain fiber.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=191s)** — And that includes the fiber from beans,
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=195s)** — lentils and bran.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=197s)** — And unfortunately now, even the keto community,
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=199s)** — there's all sorts of new synthetic fibers
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=203s)** — like corn fiber and tapioca fiber
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=206s)** — and all sorts of things that are, I think, very unhealthy.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=210s)** — But we won't go there on this video.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=212s)** — All right, number two is the side effect
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=214s)** — from their medication and acids and a depressants
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=218s)** — are common medications that have side effects
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=221s)** — of constipation, but there are others as well.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=223s)** — So I always like to kind of look at the obvious.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=226s)** — What's the elephant in the room?
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=227s)** — And if someone's doing medication
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=229s)** — just look that up and see if it has
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=231s)** — a side effect of constipation.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=233s)** — Now, the next thing is a lack of thiamine, vitamin B1.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=237s)** — B1 is intimately involved in what's called
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=242s)** — the peristalsis, so the pumping action of the colon,
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=245s)** — because it helps build up what's called
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=248s)** — a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=251s)** — And so the reason why people are deficient in B1
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=253s)** — is that they consume too many carbs and sugars.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=255s)** — But B1 can sometimes easily correct constipation.
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=259s)** — Plus it supports the vagus nerve,
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=262s)** — which is part of the autonomic nervous system,
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=264s)** — which actually can really help if someone has
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=267s)** — like too much stress too and everything is locked up
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=270s)** — because they're more in this flight or fight mode.
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=273s)** — So that would be another reason, stress.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=275s)** — Okay, stress is a part of that as well.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=278s)** — Now, the next one is a lack of bile.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=280s)** — If you're lacking bile,
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=282s)** — typically you will have constipation.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=284s)** — Bile tends to lubricate the colon.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=288s)** — And sometimes people have like this bile sludge
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=291s)** — that's bound up into the bile ducts
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=294s)** — and that can cause pain in the right shoulder
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=295s)** — or discomfort or tightness underneath the right rib cage,
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=299s)** — which is indication that they don't have enough bile.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=302s)** — By adding more bile salts as a supplement,
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=305s)** — you can sometimes relieve constipation
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=308s)** — and even get rid of constipation
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=310s)** — because it helps to lubricate the colon
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=312s)** — and also helps you digest.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=314s)** — But I want to bring that up
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=315s)** — as a definite cause to constipation.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=319s)** — If you take too much bile, you'll get diarrhea.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=323s)** — So that's a good way to know
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=324s)** — if you're taking too much bile.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=326s)** — The other thing is that dysbiosis.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=329s)** — This is the involving imbalance
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=332s)** — in your microflora and your gut.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=335s)** — So instead of adding more fiber,
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=337s)** — why don't you just add more of a probiotic, right?
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=340s)** — That would be a better thing to do
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=342s)** — because the microbes in constipation
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=344s)** — a lot of times are missing.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=346s)** — But if you have SIBO,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=347s)** — which is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth,
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=350s)** — if you take these microbes,
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=353s)** — they end up in the small intestine
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=354s)** — and that can actually give you more bloating.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=356s)** — So if you get more bloating with probiotics,
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=359s)** — then we know you might have SIBO.
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=360s)** — Another common cause of constipation
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=362s)** — is the person's eating too many frequent meals.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=365s)** — They're having three meals, three snacks,
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=368s)** — and you never let your digestive system
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=370s)** — have a chance to breathe or rest in between eating.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=374s)** — So going on an intermittent fasting schedule is huge.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=378s)** — It's a game changer for someone
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=379s)** — that has chronic constipation
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=381s)** — because you finally have a chance
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=382s)** — to let your digestive system rest in between eating.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=387s)** — It's not natural to eat of that frequency.
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=391s)** — Another thing is sometimes when people eat
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=392s)** — way too much protein,
- **[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=394s)** — sometimes they go on carnivore and they get constipated,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=397s)** — they need to increase more fat to their protein ratios
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=399s)** — because if they have too much protein,
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=401s)** — you can only digest or assimilate so much protein
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=405s)** — and the rest can be a problem
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=408s)** — and sometimes it can be constipating.
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=410s)** — That's why like on the Atkins diet,
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=412s)** — which is a high protein diet,
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=413s)** — one of the side effects is constipation
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=415s)** — versus the healthy version of keto that I recommend,
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=418s)** — it's a moderate amount of protein.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=420s)** — And then the other thing that's connected to that
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=422s)** — is low hydrochloric acid.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=424s)** — If you don't have enough HCl in your stomach,
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=427s)** — you're not gonna be able to digest protein
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=429s)** — and that is going to cause constipation
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=431s)** — because you're gonna have incomplete digestion
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=433s)** — at a higher level.
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=434s)** — So you have this huge tube that's like 25 feet long.
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=439s)** — If you can't digest way up at the top of the tube,
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=442s)** — think about what happens lower in the chain of events.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=445s)** — You get a lot of undigested food material
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=447s)** — that just backs up as a traffic jam.
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=451s)** — So adding butane-hydrochloride,
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=453s)** — apple cider vinegar when you eat is a very smart thing.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=456s)** — The other thing is like you're very low
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrLaoAngJsw&t=458s)** — in magnesium and potassium.
