- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=0s)** — This is why I stretch every single day. Here are the benefits that I found personally with myself.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=6s)** — It helps my sleep. It helps reduce pain and decrease inflammation.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=10s)** — It takes me out of what's called the fight-or-flight mode.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=13s)** — And I also stretch to counter all of the injuries that I've had over the years.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=17s)** — Most people have this confusion that the problem is the muscle.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=20s)** — The muscle is too tight, so I need to stretch. That's actually not true.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=23s)** — What really becomes tight is something that we're going to talk about called the fascia.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=27s)** — If you think of a wetsuit that surrounds the entire body, that would be fascia.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=31s)** — And the thing about fascia, it's totally connected.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=34s)** — There's a very interesting short clip I want to share with you on the dynamics of how living or how alive your fascia is.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=43s)** — Check this out.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=44s)** — Alain Langevin of the National Institutes of Health, however, made a bizarre discovery while learning acupuncture.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=50s)** — She noticed that as the needle was inserted into the skin, something seemed to be grabbing and pulling at it.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=56s)** — When Langevin took these results to the lab, an MRI revealed that the collagen fibers of the fascia were actually winding themselves around the needle, like spaghetti on a fork.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=66s)** — And what's more, the fibroblasts sent out chemical signals to the surrounding tissue, allowing it to expand and then relax.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=73s)** — The fibroblasts that are inside the tissues, up to several centimeters away, not just only at the needle, they expand.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=81s)** — They respond. It relaxes the tissue.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=84s)** — So the research is showing that the best thing for fascia is for it to move, to stretch and not be stagnant.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=89s)** — But what happens if you don't really move at all?
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=91s)** — If you're super sedentary, you haven't tried to touch your toes in a very long time and you have body parts that haven't been through their full range of motion in a long, long while.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=103s)** — When you injure your fascia, you develop scar tissue.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=106s)** — So what happens, the fascial layers can no longer glide.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=110s)** — They get stuck together like glue.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=111s)** — Healthy fascia is supposed to be dynamic, movable, flexible, and it even has electrical properties.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=118s)** — And unhealthy fascia, especially if it's been injured, develops a disorganized pattern of connective tissue.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=124s)** — And you might think, oh, I just have stiff muscles.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=126s)** — No, you have a stiff fascia.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=127s)** — And I'm going to teach you really amazing stretches that I do every single night to undo all the bad effects of this accumulated stress that we have in our bodies.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=137s)** — Probably the worst case scenario fascial problem is when someone has contractures.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=142s)** — You see people with bad posture that are literally stuck forward and they can't get out of this posture.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=148s)** — So it's very unfortunate where this connective tissue literally keeps you in a frozen state.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=153s)** — And now it's grown in that way and it's stuck.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=157s)** — It's very difficult, if not impossible, to undo that.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=159s)** — If you start to find your body in a certain position, you want to actively and aggressively undo that position so you can keep things erect and keep your motion in your body.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=169s)** — I mean, very similar to when I broke my leg and in just three weeks I had a cast on there.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=174s)** — Well, when I took that cast off, literally my whole leg and the ankle was just kind of frozen.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=179s)** — I had to undo it.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=180s)** — And yes, there was atrophy of the muscle, but the fascia actually grew in a certain position.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=186s)** — Why? Because there was no motion.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=188s)** — I didn't move it.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=189s)** — And I had to break up those adhesions and get it back to where it should be.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=194s)** — If I just left it like that, it would just literally over time just fuse in that position.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=198s)** — And so there's a right way to stretch fascia and there's a wrong way.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=202s)** — But the more that you can elongate that tissue, the better.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=206s)** — Versus just a two-dimensional thing where maybe you're just touching your toes.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=210s)** — I mean, that might help stretch your lower back, but I'm going to go through a lot deeper stretches.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=214s)** — What you're going to be doing in this first stretch is you're going to be holding this band behind your back,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=220s)** — stretching all the stuff in the front upper chest and shoulder area.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=224s)** — This is where we hold a lot of tension and where gravity starts pulling it down.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=228s)** — So we're going to reverse that.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=230s)** — Basically leverage using the band behind your back while you are looking in a certain direction
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=237s)** — and creating as much length as possible in that area.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=242s)** — So I might do this for like 30 seconds and then I relax.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=245s)** — This will take care of the tension in your back, in the neck and the shoulders.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=250s)** — Now we're going to stretch the side of your back and underneath your arm and the shoulder all at once,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=256s)** — where we're doing a lateral bending exercise.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=260s)** — And this really loosens up your shoulders by stretching in a position that you don't normally stretch in.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=266s)** — So we're going to do one side and then we'll do the opposite side as well.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=269s)** — Number three is a very important area because it stretches out a muscle called the psoas.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=275s)** — Psoas is a muscle in your core that attaches the upper body to the lower legs.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=281s)** — And this muscle is the flexor of the hips.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=284s)** — This gets tight when we sit all day or we drive long distances.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=288s)** — So we're going to do this with one leg first.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=290s)** — And you're just going to mimic what I'm showing you right now.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=292s)** — So we're stretching one psoas muscle at a time.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=295s)** — Then the next stretch, we're going to stretch both psoas muscles at the same time,
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=300s)** — where you're kneeling and you're bending backwards
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=303s)** — and you're taking all that fascial tension through the core.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=306s)** — This is like taking your spine and kind of like wringing it out, okay,
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=311s)** — as we stabilize the lower part of the body with one side.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=315s)** — And then we'll reverse it and do the opposite side.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=317s)** — All right, this last one kind of combines a couple things.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=319s)** — We're going to be using the band to get all the upper chest and your shoulders relaxed.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=326s)** — So we're going to be kneeling and bending backwards with this band.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=330s)** — Boy, this will take a lot of tension out of the entire body.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=334s)** — So sometimes people will tell you that the fascia holds trauma.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=338s)** — But when we get into motions and severe stress and especially injury,
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=342s)** — or even the most severe type of stress, which is major losses,
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=346s)** — I personally recommend the technique they use in Dianetics.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=348s)** — And the word Dianetics means what the mind is doing to the body.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=352s)** — So let's say, for example, you're five years old and you're climbing a tree
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=355s)** — and the tree is in the front part of your yard and your friend's next to you.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=359s)** — And as you hit the ground, your friend is laughing at you.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=363s)** — And at the same time, it's raining.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=365s)** — And then your mother in the distance is saying, come in and eat.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=368s)** — It's time to eat. Of course, we have the impact, the dust around your sinuses
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=372s)** — and then the emotions that you might have of fear, the fear of falling.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=376s)** — And on top of everything, maybe you went slightly unconscious.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=379s)** — When that happens, things in that moment can act as triggers
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=383s)** — 20 years down the road or even longer.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=385s)** — So let's say 20 years down the road, it's raining and you feel achiness
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=390s)** — and you lower it back and you're not sure why.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=392s)** — Or someone's laughing at you and instead of having like a kind of a mild reaction,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=397s)** — you have a really big reaction to that.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=399s)** — All of those triggers in that moment of unconsciousness and pain
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=403s)** — can act like triggers later in life.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=406s)** — And this really explains those things that are hard to figure out,
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=409s)** — especially with phobias and weird body problems that just come out of nowhere.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=413s)** — So yes, when you injure yourself, I think that the fascia and the muscles
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=416s)** — can go in this protect mode.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=417s)** — But what really is underneath that is that those mental pictures
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=421s)** — of that time where you had an earlier injury.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=424s)** — In summary, if we all end up really stiff when we get older,
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=428s)** — you want to actively and aggressively prevent that from happening.
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=431s)** — Stretching on a daily basis is the ultimate answer for that.
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=435s)** — The type of stretching that you do is very important.
- **[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=437s)** — I hope you now have some deeper insights on fascia
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=440s)** — and how you should stretch that.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=441s)** — Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.
