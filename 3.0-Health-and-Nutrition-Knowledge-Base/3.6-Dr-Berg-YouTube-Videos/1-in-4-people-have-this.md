- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=0s)** — The number one remedy for a toxic liver is something that you need to know about simply because
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=5s)** — most people have toxicity in the liver and they don't even know it yet. And that is because it
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=10s)** — takes years, decades of damage to the liver before you even notice a symptom. Now some of
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=15s)** — the first signs of a liver problem are yellow eyes, yellow skin, nausea, little red dots on
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=25s)** — your skin, and just basically the lack of get up and go. So the cool thing is there is
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=29s)** — one thing that can greatly counter a lot of different toxic effects. For example, you might
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=37s)** — drink some alcohol, right? And you wake up with a hangover. This remedy will eliminate that
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=43s)** — hangover. Okay, it reduces the damage of alcohol to your liver. It also counters bad effects from
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=50s)** — smoking, right? So here you're smoking a cigarette or you get secondhand smoke. It
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=54s)** — goes into your lungs. It goes into your bloodstream. And guess where it ends up? In your
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=58s)** — liver. So this remedy can counter the damage from smoking. Let's say you have a toxic solvent
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=65s)** — that's on your skin, ends up in your bloodstream, ends up in the liver. Now this remedy can also
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=71s)** — handle other things like ibuprofen, which is a little bit different. It's not an anti-inflammatory.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=77s)** — It's just something that gets rid of pain. It can help you with the fever. Then you have the
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=82s)** — toxicity from chemotherapy, radiation therapy, all the chemicals from your environment,
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=89s)** — including herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, fungicides. And this remedy is called NAC.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=98s)** — I'm really glad that it's still in the market because they did take it off the market
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=101s)** — for a period of time because it's actually used as a drug. But it's a natural remedy.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=106s)** — So what does NAC really do? Well, it does several things. Number one, it's a key nutrient to
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=112s)** — replenish something called glutathione, which is a very important antioxidant in your entire
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=119s)** — body, including the liver. Now glutathione acts as an antioxidant that helps to counter
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=126s)** — free radical damage. Now let me just kind of explain antioxidants and free radical damage.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=131s)** — If you were to envision spinning a plate around in a circle, and you had a few weights that were
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=138s)** — balanced on each side of the plate, it could spin very symmetrically. But if you took one
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=142s)** — of the weights off and you spun it, it's no longer balanced. Just think about what that's
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=148s)** — doing. That's creating a lot of unpaired electrons, which then create a lot of
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=152s)** — destruction in the body. So the antioxidant donates an electron to give it to this free
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=161s)** — radical, to make it no longer a free radical, to balance out that plate that's spinning.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=166s)** — Now here's the problem. The antioxidant now is lost electron. So it has to regenerate that,
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=173s)** — and it gets help from other antioxidants. And this is why you don't just have one antioxidant.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=179s)** — Like in the liver, you have glutathione, you have vitamin E, you have vitamin C, and they all
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=185s)** — work together to help donate electrons. And one of the cool things about NAC is it helps to
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=193s)** — regenerate glutathione, which then help to regenerate other antioxidants. NAC also
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=200s)** — increases and enhances this other thing in the liver called phase one, phase two detoxification.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=206s)** — So this phase one, phase two detoxification can take a fat soluble poison and turn it into a
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=213s)** — water soluble harmless particle. Guess what? NAC can enhance that process in the liver.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=220s)** — NAC also helps to regenerate liver tissue. It can also help reduce or prevent the liver cells
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=227s)** — from committing suicide, which is kind of like the liver self-destructing. And especially I
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=236s)** — are consuming alcohol or smoking or exposed to any type of toxicity. Now I want to actually
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=243s)** — take this to the next level. I want to show you how to make NAC very, very potent. First
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=249s)** — thing is to always take it on an empty stomach. It's going to work better. Secondly,
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=253s)** — you want to take several doses throughout the day. NAC is even more potent if you add it with
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=262s)** — vitamin C and selenium. The last thing I want to mention about this is that when you take
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=269s)** — NAC, your next meal should be high in protein. That's going to help increase more amino acids to
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=275s)** — help this glutathione work a little bit better. And in addition to the animal protein that I
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=280s)** — would recommend, I would also recommend doing the cruciferous vegetables, right? Because it's
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=285s)** — with antioxidants. And so that way you have plenty of extra additional things that your
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=291s)** — body can draw from to actually help deliver. Now, if you have not seen my glutathione video,
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnhb2-bQKY&t=297s)** — you might want to watch that. I put it right here. Check it out.
