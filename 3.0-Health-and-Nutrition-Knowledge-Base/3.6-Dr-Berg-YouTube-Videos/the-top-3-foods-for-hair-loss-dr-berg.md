- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=0s)** — So let's talk about the foods that most commonly rob you of nutrients. So this video is not about
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=6s)** — getting nutrients from food. It's about being aware of certain foods that deplete you of
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=11s)** — nutrients. So you have to know both sides. So the first one I'm going to talk about is raw
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=16s)** — egg whites. Okay, anytime you eat raw egg whites you can create a biotin deficiency.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=22s)** — Biotin is really important for your nails and your hair. It makes the hair and nails thicker
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=28s)** — and stronger. And if you're deficient in biotin you're probably going to notice that your hair is
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=32s)** — starting to become brittle. Your nails break easily. Biotin also can become depleted after
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=39s)** — taking an antibiotic because a good portion of your microbes also make this biotin which is
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=44s)** — a B vitamin. Now of course the next three foods are... you pretty much already know this but
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=54s)** — you'll deplete you of vitamin B1, zinc, magnesium, and vitamin C. Massive calories in their diet,
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=63s)** — they're usually going to have these deficiencies. It's going to show up as
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=66s)** — bleeding gums, fatigue because of the vitamin C. They're also going to notice that their
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=71s)** — immune system is going to be very weak because of the zinc issue as well as noticing skin
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=76s)** — issues. A lot of skin issues are related to a zinc deficiency. And of course a B1 deficiency will
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=82s)** — cause a lot of anxiety, nervous tension, excessive stress, thinking about things, worrying about
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=89s)** — things too much, muscle cramps at night, difficulty in getting to sleep because your
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=94s)** — muscles are so tense. Next one is caffeinated beverages like in coffee and tea and soda. The
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=106s)** — And then we get into something else called trypsin inhibitors. Like what's a trypsin
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=113s)** — inhibitor? Trypsin is an enzyme and if you inhibit that with the following foods,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=119s)** — soy, grains, beans, nuts, seeds, and nightshades, you could have a problem absorbing
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=127s)** — certain amino acids. Also absorbing fat soluble vitamins. Now what a lot of people do to
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=136s)** — germinate or sprout those foods. But people that don't germinate it and they just eat it raw
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=142s)** — thinking it's going to be better are in for a surprise. Because in that raw food, that
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=147s)** — un-germinated food, there's certain defense mechanisms that those plants have created to
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=154s)** — prevent the digestion of those plants. And then we get into another chemical called tannins
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=159s)** — and that's in tea. That will definitely create a B1 deficiency, especially for those people that
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=164s)** — are big tea drinkers and they just drink tea all day long, which is actually better than coffee,
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=169s)** — but it can create a B1 deficiency and it can start affecting your sleep and your mood.
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=175s)** — If you are taking too much calcium, you can actually create a magnesium deficiency. This
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=181s)** — also goes along with consuming a lot of dairy. Without leafy greens, you create a magnesium
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=187s)** — deficiency. Magnesium helps you relax at night. It helps the muscles relax. It prevents cramps.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=194s)** — Arrhythmias and also magnesium is behind energy. So if you're fatigued, chances are you might be
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=201s)** — magnesium deficient. Then we get to something called oxalates. So oxalates are compounds that
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=208s)** — bind with calcium, magnesium, and iron. And when it binds with the calcium, it can actually
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=215s)** — form kidney stones. And there are certain foods, especially in the ketogenic diet,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=220s)** — that are loaded with oxalates. Spinach being at the top of the list, but I think there's one
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=226s)** — bigger than that. That would be beet greens. Beets also have oxalates. Almonds, almond flour,
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=234s)** — chocolate, Swiss chard, and other non-keto foods like grains and beans. Phosphoric acid
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=242s)** — in sodas actually will definitely deplete you of magnesium and calcium. This is why
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=247s)** — drinking a lot of those sodas can actually really destroy your bones. And of course,
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=252s)** — you know, I don't even consider soda food, but I just threw that in there.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=256s)** — And lastly, I want to mention something called phytates or phytic acid. Same thing. Phytates are
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=263s)** — in certain foods that then block zinc, calcium, vitamin B3, chromium, copper, iron,
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=274s)** — magnesium, manganese, and vitamin D. Like kids have a lot of cereal. They're getting a lot of
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=280s)** — phytates and that's going to deplete the zinc, which is really, really important for the
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=283s)** — immune system. And in certain parts of the world, the children that are deficient in zinc
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=289s)** — have a massive problem with diarrhea. And so that can cause other problems with electrolyte
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=294s)** — deficiencies. So in summary, the foods that really deplete you of other nutrients would be
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=299s)** — the grains at the top of the list. Now, because of the censoring and the suppressing of the
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=303s)** — algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's a
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=308s)** — lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately. So to make sure you have full
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=313s)** — access of all my information, go to drburger.com and subscribe to my newsletter by clicking the
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=318s)** — link down below in the description. I will see you on the other side. And out of all the
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=329s)** — is magnesium. And magnesium has a lot to do with your energy production. So if you have not seen
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAUBavPuXpo&t=337s)** — this video on the relationship between magnesium and energy, I put it up right here. Check it out.
