- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=0s)** — Drink this every single day until you don't have joint pain anymore.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=3s)** — If we talk about joint pain, just because someone has inflammation in the joint doesn't mean they have arthritis.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=8s)** — If you're eating things that are going to negate or even cause inflammation,
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=13s)** — this little remedy that you take to counter that is not going to work.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=15s)** — Before I talk about what you need to add into the diet to resolve your joint pain,
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=20s)** — let's talk about what you need to avoid in the diet.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=22s)** — Sugar, high fructose corn syrup.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=24s)** — If you're doing too much of that, you're going to literally put fire into your joints.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=29s)** — The second thing is to avoid this stuff right here. Seed oils.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=33s)** — Seed oils like corn oil, soy oil, canola are very high in omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=39s)** — It creates more inflammation versus the omega-3 fatty acids, fish oils, cod liver oil,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=45s)** — that's very anti-inflammatory.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=47s)** — Then we have gluten. Anything with gluten, we're talking about wheat and other grains,
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=51s)** — has a potential for causing a lot of inflammation, not just in your joints but also in your gut.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=56s)** — You also have something called oxalates.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=57s)** — Oxalates are crystal-like sharp things that can go into the joints and cause inflammation,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=64s)** — and they can also cause kidney stones.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=66s)** — And I really think that the people that have problems with oxalates
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=69s)** — are people that had a history of antibiotics,
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=71s)** — because you have the microbe in your gut that's supposed to eat up these oxalates.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=76s)** — And if it's missing because you had an antibiotic long ago,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=80s)** — then you're more susceptible to having this arthritic pain from oxalates,
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=84s)** — especially when you have spinach, chocolate, almonds, and Swiss chard.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=88s)** — If you consume more magnesium in your diet,
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=91s)** — you can actually really bring these oxalates way down, even if you eat the foods high in oxalates.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=96s)** — Then you have other things too that can flare up your joints like MSG.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=100s)** — You're going to find that in fast food restaurants.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=102s)** — Multidextrin is a highly refined starch that can also flare up your joints.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=105s)** — It's in a lot of processed foods.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=107s)** — Then you have nightshades, potatoes, peppers, tomatoes.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=111s)** — The last chemical I want to talk about is lectins.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=114s)** — That would be in beans, peanuts, wheat, and especially soy products.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=120s)** — Lectins can increase inflammation.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=122s)** — And of course, the diet that I recommend doesn't include any of those.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=125s)** — So if you just follow that diet, which I'll put a link down below, you'll be really safe.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=129s)** — Let's get right into that drink I'm going to recommend for getting rid of inflammation in your joints.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=134s)** — And the big ingredient in this is turmeric.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=136s)** — And I recommend getting turmeric in a powder.
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=139s)** — And we're just going to add a teaspoon of turmeric.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=141s)** — Take this glass, half water and half coconut milk.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=146s)** — Because it's going to be really creamy if you do that.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=148s)** — It's going to taste great.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=150s)** — And you're going to stir this up really nice.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=152s)** — And I would take like a little pinch of black pepper because that'll increase the absorption by 2000%.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=157s)** — And then on top of that, I recommend putting a scoop of collagen powder.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=161s)** — For most people, it should taste fine. It should taste quite delicious.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=165s)** — For some people, you might need to add a couple drops of liquid stevia if you really need to.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=169s)** — But I think you'll just like the taste of it.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=172s)** — It's kind of a creamy aromatic turmeric flavor with a little taste of coconut.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=177s)** — But that is going to be the shake.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=179s)** — And you want to drink that down every single day.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=181s)** — And for some people, they actually heat it up a little bit.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=184s)** — Not too hot, just so it becomes nice and warm.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=187s)** — And they might drink that as a nice warm drink.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=189s)** — It really doesn't matter if you're having it in the morning and at night.
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=193s)** — But I do recommend for most people have it in the morning.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=195s)** — That way, you can kind of be pain-free all day long.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=199s)** — The thing you need to realize is turmeric compares in effectiveness to ibuprofen
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=205s)** — and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=208s)** — If you take turmeric in the supplement, I would recommend 1,000 or 1,500 milligram doses per day.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=215s)** — But turmeric inhibits at least four major inflammatory pathways.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=221s)** — And then the black pepper increases the absorption.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=224s)** — And then there's also great things in coconut too.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=226s)** — Especially being a nice fat to help this fat soluble compound be absorbed even more.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=232s)** — And of course, the collagen can help build up your joints on top of everything else I talked about.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=237s)** — Now let's talk about Baswellia serrata.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=240s)** — In research in 2018, in the Phyto-medicine journal,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=244s)** — Baswellia serrata showed significant joint pain relief and as effective as NSAIDs.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=251s)** — And guess what? Without side effects.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=253s)** — It's amazing. This plant lives in very dry, harsh climates.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=258s)** — In certain countries like India and Asian countries,
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=261s)** — regions of the earth where there's harsh deserts.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=264s)** — And there's a resin that is formed and created when there's damage to the bark.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=271s)** — This particular chemical, it's a response to a physical wound in the bark, which is wild.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=277s)** — So basically, you're consuming something from stressed out trees.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=281s)** — And then when we consume this particular thing,
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=284s)** — it creates a low dose stress in our bodies that then cause our own body to create antioxidant
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=291s)** — chemicals to then get rid of inflammation. The term for that is called hormesis,
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=296s)** — which is like a controlled stress to improve our survival.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=300s)** — Just like exercise is hormesis. We're actually adding stress to make us healthier.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=305s)** — Well, we can do that with various compounds in plants.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=308s)** — With this thing called Basuella, we are taking something to
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=313s)** — potently decrease our inflammation in our joints.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=316s)** — It compares with medications, but without side effects.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=320s)** — Now that you have the drink for joint pain,
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=322s)** — let's shift to the best exercise for joint pain.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=326s)** — And it's called walking. Walking compares to
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=328s)** — hardcore medicine, but without any side effects.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=332s)** — It's not just for your joints. It's for extending your life.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=336s)** — No exaggeration. Check it out.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2vs-Ud6bo&t=338s)** — I put that video right here. Watch it now.
