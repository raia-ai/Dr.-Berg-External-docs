- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the early warning signs of colon cancer you absolutely do not want to ignore.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=5s)** — So when I give you these six warning signs, just realize these are indicators. They're not
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=10s)** — meant to diagnose you. Indicators are symptoms that there is a situation, but it doesn't tell
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=17s)** — you what it is unless you look at all the information. But here's the thing, 50% of the
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=21s)** — time there is no early warning signs. So it is important not to ignore these signs but to
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=28s)** — understand them and pay attention to them. Now I do want to mention polyps, the little mini tumors
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=34s)** — that can grow in your colon. And a lot of times people think that if you have polyps that means
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=41s)** — you have cancer. No, it could be a benign little tiny tumor that does not grow, does not turn
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=48s)** — into cancer. In fact, 80% of the time there's only a very very tiny risk between 0% to 2%
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=56s)** — getting cancer. There are various risk factors that people talk about, you know, like smoking
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=61s)** — and drinking and junk food and obesity and H. pylori. That's a microbe that tends to live in
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=68s)** — the stomach but it can travel different places. And then there's this topic of red meat or
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=74s)** — processed meat that you may have heard of. They always tend to talk about that. There was a group
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=78s)** — that concluded that it's a probable carcinogen, okay, but the data and the evidence is pretty
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=86s)** — weak. Especially since this new report came out in JAMA which was a bigger evaluation of the
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=93s)** — data on red meat and processed meat. And they found out if you actually include carbohydrates
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=99s)** — into the equation there's no association between red meat or even processed meat and
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=105s)** — cancer. And I'm going to put that link down below. I hope you read it because there's been
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=109s)** — this massive push to make meat the villain when in fact that may not be true. There's a huge
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=115s)** — difference between different types of red meat, right? You have grass-fed grass-finished meat
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=122s)** — versus grain-fed meat. Did they evaluate those two? No. They lumped everything in together
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=128s)** — and their evidence was based on observational studies using questionnaires. And they ignored
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=133s)** — a lot of the data into this evaluation. And from my viewpoint, my opinion, I do not think that
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=140s)** — red meat puts people at risk for cancer. Now what about genetics? Well, yeah, there's a
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=146s)** — genetic component but it's only five percent. Epigenetics, your lifestyle, are senior and
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=151s)** — what you do, what you eat, your environment can control your genes. And then that leads
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=157s)** — to this microbiome being out of balance. 80 percent of your immune system is these microbes
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=164s)** — in your gut. Your immune system is what protects you against cancer. I mean, look at another
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=168s)** — thing, antibiotics. In one report, it was like it increased your risk by 45 percent. So anything
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=174s)** — that can alter your microbiome in a negative way can put you at risk. So you want to look at
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=178s)** — what causes inflammation in our gut, right? What can that be? Well, you have gluten, you have
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=183s)** — foods, seed oils, all these things can create inflammation in your gut and then that can create
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=189s)** — a cascade and create alteration in this microbiome. But the microbiome can keep
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=194s)** — viruses in check. So, and I'm going to get to this, but when you eat food, you're really
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=199s)** — eating for two, okay? Your own cells and your microbiome. Okay, so what are the early warning
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=206s)** — signs that could potentially indicate colon cancer? Number one, blood in the stool.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=212s)** — Okay, that's number one. But if there's blood in the stool deeper in your digestive tract,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=218s)** — by the time it gets out, it's no longer going to be red. It'll be black. Number two, anemia.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=223s)** — Okay, you're anemic, yet there's no reason to be anemic. That could be a potential indicator.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=229s)** — Number three, the shape of the stool is thinner because there's obviously some cancer
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=236s)** — obstructing the colon, altering the shape of your stool. Number four, you have constipation
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=242s)** — that seems to be getting worse. Why would that be? Because there's an obstruction in your colon.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=248s)** — Number five, abdominal pain. Why would you have that? Well, because there's a certain mass
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=253s)** — that's growing in your colon and it's pushing on nerve endings. Number six, a sudden cause
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=258s)** — of weight loss or a loss of appetite. So again, these six indicators or clues are just
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=266s)** — indicators. That doesn't mean you have a problem and you don't want to treat them as a problem.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=272s)** — You want to find out what's behind the problem. You know, the doctor comes in with authority
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=277s)** — and says, you have this period of time to live. And it's interesting how people tend to
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=285s)** — live that particular time. You're in a state of confusion. Everyone's telling you to do this
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=290s)** — and what do you do? Especially based on this particular person who should have been dead
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=298s)** — six years ago because he had a stage four cancer. And the prognosis of stage four cancer is like
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=303s)** — weeks to months. He should have been dead six years ago. He's still alive.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=307s)** — And it'd be very important to study what he did. But we're going to talk about how to
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=311s)** — potentially avoid cancer. Okay. What are some things you can do? As far as antibiotics,
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=316s)** — avoid those if you possibly can. And if you have to take antibiotics, definitely fortify with a
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=323s)** — good probiotic. I think intermittent fasting and periodic prolonged fasting is essential.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=329s)** — Why? Because it's going to clear out the colon. You allow your colon to have a chance
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=333s)** — to regenerate, heal, and not be so stressed 24-7. I think the cruciferous
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=338s)** — vegetables would be something to look at and consume not every day, but maybe a few times
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=344s)** — That would be like kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage. Now, if I eat broccoli,
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=349s)** — it tears my gut up. So any of these cruciferous vegetables that you eat that you bloat,
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=354s)** — don't eat them. I can do cabbage and arugula very easily. And then when you ferment it,
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=360s)** — you get all this probiotic. Now, remember when I talked about inactivity? Well, activity as
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=366s)** — an exercise is probably one of the most potent things you can do to avoid cancer. Why? Because
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=372s)** — you're strengthening your mitochondria and all cancer originates from a dysfunctional
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=378s)** — mitochondria. So by exercising, you actually generate more mitochondria and you actually
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=384s)** — strengthen the mitochondria. Things like garlic, thyme, sage, different spices,
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=391s)** — I think you should start putting those on your meat or your salad. You want to avoid
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=395s)** — certain things that create inflammation like gluten and grains and seed oils and junk foods.
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=401s)** — And also one point about inflammation is cancer tends to grow into areas of inflammation.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=408s)** — Now, I think there's a lot more to be learned about the microbiome. And if you have not
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTlp6VTu4S8&t=413s)** — seen this video right here, I think you'll enjoy it.
