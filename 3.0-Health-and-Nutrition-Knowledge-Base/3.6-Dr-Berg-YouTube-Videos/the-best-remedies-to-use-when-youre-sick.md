- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=0s)** — You know, I've done a lot of videos on the immune system.
- **[00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=2s)** — Today we're going to talk about what to do once you get an infection
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=6s)** — and what is the fastest way to overcome this infection.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=9s)** — Well, the first thing to do is to kind of figure out or guess
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=13s)** — if it's more a viral infection or a bacterial infection.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=18s)** — So with a viral infection, it's going to be more systemic.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=20s)** — So you're going to probably feel more body aches,
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=23s)** — chills with bacterial.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=25s)** — It could be more localized to like lymph nodes
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=29s)** — or maybe urinary tract infection or food poisoning.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=33s)** — A fever in a bacterial infection goes a little bit higher than a viral.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=38s)** — So if your fever is really super high, potentially it could be more bacterial.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=42s)** — If you get a sore throat with a viral infection,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=45s)** — a lot of times you'll have a runny nose and a cough.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=48s)** — But with a bacterial sore throat, you're going to feel just like more pain
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=52s)** — and localized without the runny nose.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=55s)** — That's a type I used to have every single year growing up.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=59s)** — It was terrible.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=60s)** — With a virus, you'll have more of a dry cough, bacterial, productive cough,
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=66s)** — which means there'll be mucus involved.
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=68s)** — Typically when you have a respiratory infection,
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=71s)** — sinus or lung or bronchitis, think viral.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=76s)** — But if you have pneumonia, you can have both bacterial and virus,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=81s)** — except sometimes in a childhood illness you'll get pneumonia, viral pneumonia.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=85s)** — But if you have like the common cold or a flu,
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=88s)** — that's typically going to be viral.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=90s)** — Now as far as how long these infections can go,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=93s)** — with a viral it could be one to two weeks.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=96s)** — With the bacterial it could be a little bit longer.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=99s)** — And this all depends on your immune system.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=102s)** — The mucus with a viral infection usually is clear or white.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=106s)** — But with a bacterial infection it's more green or yellow.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=111s)** — There's a couple remedies that I recommend for viral.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=114s)** — Elderberry or olive leaf extract.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=118s)** — For bacterial I would recommend garlic,
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=123s)** — oregano oil and echinacea.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=126s)** — Think about echinacea.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=127s)** — If you can catch this infection in time and you take echinacea,
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=133s)** — you can sometimes stop it from going into a full-blown infection.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=137s)** — Now at the very end of this video,
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=139s)** — I want to reveal something very important about a sore throat.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=142s)** — It's a technique.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=144s)** — You want to take a hot bath or hot shower
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=146s)** — and dress very very warm to the point where you're even sweating.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=151s)** — Why? Because we want to cook the virus or bacteria.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=155s)** — We want to heat you up to the point where we can kill off this infection.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=161s)** — The side effects from this infection really are your immune system
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=165s)** — killing off the microbes and your normal cells are also being affected.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=170s)** — So really think about this is not a bad thing.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=172s)** — It's just your immune system is working.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=174s)** — Go to bed early. The more sleep you can get, the better.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=178s)** — A lack of sleep will really weaken your immune system.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=181s)** — I think it's really important to take zinc, vitamin D and vitamin C.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=186s)** — Fasting, I think is a very very good thing.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=188s)** — That way you're stimulating your immune system
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=190s)** — and allowing your immune system to work.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=192s)** — And when you fast, you actually increase your survival genes.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=196s)** — They start to kick in and there's a lot of benefits from fasting
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=200s)** — that go way beyond just your immune system.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=201s)** — But fasting will help your immune system.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=204s)** — Sea salt is a very important thing.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=207s)** — Sea salt also helps increase the parasympathetic nervous system
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=210s)** — and decreases the sympathetic nervous system.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=213s)** — Sea salt can help you sleep at night.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=215s)** — The other thing that's really important is to do whatever you can
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=218s)** — to improve your emotional state.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=221s)** — Whether you have anxiety or depression,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=223s)** — you know, go for a walk, listen to music,
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=225s)** — do something to pull yourself up.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=227s)** — Because infections last longer in lower emotional states.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=234s)** — The sun gives us many cool things
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=236s)** — that go beyond just making vitamin D.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=239s)** — It also gives you UVB, which is anti-inflammatory.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=243s)** — Also, the sun gives you infrared.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=246s)** — And infrared can do a lot.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=248s)** — It's anti-inflammatory.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=249s)** — It can increase melatonin.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=252s)** — It's immunoregulatory.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=254s)** — It helps sleep, repair, enhance the mitochondria.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=258s)** — It can increase killer T cells.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=260s)** — And it can even dampen this cytokine storm.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=263s)** — Many, many, many times when people get sick,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=266s)** — there usually is always some type of predisposing factor,
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=269s)** — like some type of stress that allows this infection to take over.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=276s)** — So anything you can do to reduce that would be very, very good.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=280s)** — This is why they give prednisone, which is a synthetic version of cortisol,
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=283s)** — to any type of immune problem that someone has.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=287s)** — And it gets rid of it. It suppresses it.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=289s)** — If someone is low in vitamin D or zinc,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=294s)** — they can be more susceptible to having an infection too.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=298s)** — Also, you should make note that when you eat
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=300s)** — refined sugar or refined food,
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=304s)** — that can deplete zinc as well as vitamin C.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=307s)** — The chemistry of vitamin C is similar to glucose.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=311s)** — And so if you're consuming any type of sugar
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=314s)** — while you're consuming vitamin C,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=317s)** — you're going to block the absorption of vitamin C
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=320s)** — because the body is going to take in the sugar.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=321s)** — As we age, the thymus gland,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=324s)** — it's a little gland on top of the heart that really
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=327s)** — is so important in training your T cells,
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=330s)** — it starts to shrink as we age.
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=332s)** — So when we get older, our immune system gets weaker, unfortunately.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=337s)** — If you have microbial imbalance in your gut flora
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=340s)** — or you don't have enough microbiome diversity,
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=344s)** — that can put you at risk for having a problem as well.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=347s)** — And of course, you know, sometimes people have this idea
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=349s)** — that I'm going to try to kill off this infection by
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=352s)** — doing a shot of whiskey.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=354s)** — No, I wouldn't do that. It's not going to help you.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=357s)** — And another good remedy is cod liver oil. Why?
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=362s)** — Because not only does cod liver oil have the omega-3 fatty acids,
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=365s)** — which are anti-inflammatory, but it has vitamin D
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=369s)** — and vitamin A, which supports your sinuses, your throat, your GI tract.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=374s)** — I used to have a lot of sore throats.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=376s)** — And in practice, there was something that I came up with
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=380s)** — that I think is mind-blowing.
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=384s)** — And it's one of those things that you just have to try out to believe it.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=388s)** — And I have a video that I'm going to put up that you can watch.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=393s)** — It's a simple technique that someone can do on you
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=396s)** — to help give you relief of the soreness of your throat infection.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=400s)** — Now, I'm not saying it does anything for the infection,
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=403s)** — but it'll definitely reduce the pain and soreness that you have
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=407s)** — if you have a sore throat.
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=408s)** — So what you're going to be doing is you're going to have someone press
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=412s)** — on the exact opposite part of where the sore throat is.
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=416s)** — So if you have a sore throat, like right through here,
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=419s)** — you're going to have someone pressing on the back part of your neck
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=422s)** — To get a full detailed understanding of what it looks like and how to do it,
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L7F5ffv6bs&t=427s)** — I put that video right here. Check it out.
