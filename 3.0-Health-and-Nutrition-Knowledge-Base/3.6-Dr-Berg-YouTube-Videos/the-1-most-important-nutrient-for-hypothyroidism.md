- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=0s)** — There's one really important nutrient involved with hypothyroidism that you need to know about.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=7s)** — Now this also relates to a hyperthyroidism too. So if you have any problems with your thyroid,
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=12s)** — this video is going to be very, very important. Now the first thing to know is that 90%
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=18s)** — of all hypothyroid problems is an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's. In most cases of
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=25s)** — hypothyroidism is also an autoimmune condition. What is an autoimmune condition? It's a situation
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=31s)** — where you have cells made by your own body. They're very specific types of antibodies
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=40s)** — against the body, little cells, that actually attack your thyroid. So you have these cells
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=47s)** — that are programmed to think that your thyroid is like a pathogen. So these antibodies attack
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=53s)** — your thyroid and prevent it from functioning. And they create a constant inflammatory condition
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=58s)** — as well. And 90% of all hypothyroid cases are autoimmune. Now let's talk about this one
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=64s)** — nutrient that's really important. You probably thought it would be iodine. It's not. Iodine is
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=69s)** — very, very important because without iodine you can't make thyroid hormones. But selenium is
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=76s)** — really important and you're going to understand why in a minute. Because most of the selenium
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=82s)** — in your body is mostly concentrated in your thyroid if you go by the weight of that tissue.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=87s)** — And if you have a hypothyroid condition, chances are you're probably deficient in selenium. It's
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=93s)** — very, very common to have a deficiency. And when you get diagnosed with this autoimmune disease,
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=99s)** — the three main antibodies that they find a problem with involves one that's called
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=106s)** — thyroid peroxidase. So these antibodies to thyroid peroxidase really inhibits your ability
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=113s)** — to make thyroid hormones. Because one of the functions of thyroid peroxidase is the production,
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=119s)** — the synthesis of thyroid hormones. And so you can just imagine by blocking that, you're not
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=124s)** — going to make enough thyroid hormones. Thus having a lowered amount of thyroid hormones.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=129s)** — That's called hypothyroidism. And then there's another one, okay, that involves the receptor
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=135s)** — for thyroid stimulating hormone. That's that hormone from the pituitary that's sent down to
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=140s)** — the blood that connects to the thyroid and tells the thyroid to make thyroid hormones.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=145s)** — And that receptor is called thyroglobulin receptor. So if you have antibodies against
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=150s)** — that receptor, you're not able to receive the message that tells the thyroid to make
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=156s)** — thyroid hormones. So you can imagine what kind of problems you're going to have if you have
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=165s)** — can help significantly reduce these antibodies. And it's something natural that you can take,
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=173s)** — and it's in your food, but you can take it in small amounts to help you. Also selenium
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=178s)** — improves the thyroid as a whole. Okay, so that's another benefit. Selenium also helps you
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=187s)** — T4 to T3. T3 is the active form. T4 is not. So T4 really doesn't do much in your body unless
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=196s)** — it's converted with the help of selenium. I mean, think about this. Let's say, for example,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=203s)** — you don't have enough selenium and you're taking Synthroid, for example, which is T4,
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=208s)** — synthetic T4. And your problem is you can't convert it to the active form. You're not
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=214s)** — see much change. You might have normal T4 in your blood, but what about the T3? You really need to
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=219s)** — look at that to make sure that is insufficient amounts. And so the point is, where's the real
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=225s)** — problem? Is it in the conversion? Is it in the production? Selenium has also been known
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=230s)** — to decrease mixed edema, which is a big problem for hypothyroid situations. It looks like that,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=236s)** — but it's not fat. It's like the puffiness that is throughout the body that makes you look
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=241s)** — fat, but it's not an actual fat. Now selenium also decreases inflammation. Why? Because it's
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=248s)** — involved in making glutathione one of the most powerful antioxidants in the body. And this is
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=256s)** — why selenium is so important with your liver as well. And that's a whole different topic,
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=261s)** — but selenium can help prevent a fatty liver. It can help prevent inflammation in the liver.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=266s)** — It can help prevent fibrosis in your liver. It can decrease your liver enzymes. It can even
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=273s)** — decrease the risk of liver cancer. Now selenium is also high in certain types of fish. And so
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=281s)** — if you're concerned about getting mercury from certain fish, fish also has selenium,
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=286s)** — which makes this protein that helps get rid of mercury in cadmium. Now mercury has been linked
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=294s)** — to autoimmune conditions of your thyroid. And cadmium by itself directly inhibits the
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=301s)** — production of thyroid hormones. So here's yet another reason why selenium is so important
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=307s)** — for these conditions. Selenium even decreased the risk of getting an autoimmune condition.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=313s)** — Because apparently when you're low in selenium, there's a higher level of initiation of
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=320s)** — autoimmune problems. It's kind of like the match that triggers the fire. And also as a by-product
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=326s)** — of thyroid metabolism, you have this hydrogen peroxide. So selenium helps you make glutathione
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=332s)** — that helps you deal with this hydrogen peroxide, which is... can create a toxicity
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=337s)** — in your thyroid. Also when you get Graves' disease, which is a hyper thyroid problem,
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=343s)** — a lot of times you get these bulging eyes. Well selenium helps reduce that symptom too.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=348s)** — Now where do you get selenium? Well it's in meat, it's in fish, it's in eggs, it's in dairy,
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=353s)** — cruciferous vegetables like cabbage and broccoli, it's in nuts, it's in onions,
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=358s)** — it's in garlic, and it's definitely in organ meats. Selenium can also help decrease
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=364s)** — the risk of getting those thyroid nodules. And it can even help prevent the enlargement of
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=370s)** — your thyroid. And your thyroid has other mechanisms of accumulating selenium, helping
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=375s)** — recycling it, and making sure that you're not ending up in a low selenium situation.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=382s)** — I hope you now know the importance of selenium as it relates to the thyroid. As far as doses
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=387s)** — go of selenium, of course I would always recommend eating foods high in selenium,
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=392s)** — but I would recommend 200 micrograms of selenium each day in a nice base of other trace
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=399s)** — minerals just to make sure you're not creating an imbalance. And if it is true that you
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=403s)** — have these antibodies, you have this autoimmune condition, whether it's Graves or Hashimoto's,
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=410s)** — I also recommend another product. I don't sell it. I'm not affiliated with the company that
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=414s)** — does, but it's called Thytrophin PMG. It's from a product developed by Standard Process.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=420s)** — Okay, so you can look that up. You would take one before bed. And that works a little
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=424s)** — bit differently, but I think the combination of both of these would be very, very important
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=428s)** — in helping you recover. And for more information about that,
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ykJdD-W_n8&t=432s)** — I included that in this video right here. You should check it out.
