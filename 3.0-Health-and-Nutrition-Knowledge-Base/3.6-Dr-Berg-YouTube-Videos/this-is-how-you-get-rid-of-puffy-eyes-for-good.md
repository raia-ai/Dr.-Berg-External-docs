- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=0s)** — I'm going to show you how to get rid of puffy eyes, okay? It's so easy.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=4s)** — All you have to do is understand the mechanism. There's a lot of fancy terms for puffy eyes.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=10s)** — Periorbital edema. All you need to know is it's called eye bags.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=14s)** — And unfortunately, the medical profession treats this condition with drugs, steroids, antihistamines, all sorts of medications.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=23s)** — And I'm not telling you not to take your medication. I just want to give you another viewpoint on this.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=27s)** — I mean, if you look up the Wikipedia page, it'll say potentially it could be caused from the hypothyroid, insomnia, infection, allergy, and a whole bunch of other causes,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=39s)** — which are so rare, and the bigger cause, the more common cause, isn't even mentioned at all.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=46s)** — And the reason I know a lot about this is I had puffy eyes for many years. I didn't know what it was.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=51s)** — But once I did this one thing, it completely cleared up.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=55s)** — Now on the Wiki page, there's two little things that were interesting, okay?
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=60s)** — They did mention one cause being high levels of sodium, which is definitely true.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=65s)** — And also they mentioned a low-carb diet could help prevent puffiness of the eyes, which I found very interesting too.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=73s)** — And they had also a little data, you know, using cucumber slices on your eyes or cold packs.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=78s)** — Yeah, maybe that might help for a second, but it doesn't really correct the problem.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=83s)** — Yes, many times the kidneys are involved, and yes, there's usually a sodium problem as well.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=89s)** — But both of these conditions are stemming from too much sugar in your bloodstream.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=95s)** — I mean, even if you take a look at the number one cause of kidney disease, it's diabetes.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=100s)** — What is diabetes? High levels of sugar.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=102s)** — So when you look at someone's eyelids and they're puffy, yeah, it could be related to the kidney, but we want to go deeper.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=109s)** — And here's the simplicity of it. This is what you need to know.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=112s)** — When there's too much sugar in the bloodstream, you're going to have too much insulin in the bloodstream.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=117s)** — You'll eventually develop insulin resistance.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=121s)** — Both of these situations causes your body to hold sodium.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=126s)** — More salt is retained when you consume sugar.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=129s)** — And if you do this for a long period of time, it'll overload the kidneys and it'll actually back up into the system.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=136s)** — And it shows up in the eyelids, sometimes even before other parts of your body.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=141s)** — I was at a restaurant about two or three months ago and I remember seeing an overweight kid with an overweight dad just chowing down serious amounts of carbs.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=154s)** — And both of them had really puffy eyes. I was very tempted to go over there and talk to them, but I didn't do it.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=160s)** — My wife said, no, you better not do that.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=162s)** — But I think a lot of people are not aware that it's coming from the sugar.
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=166s)** — So sugar causes the retention of fluid because of the retention of sodium.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=174s)** — There's a couple of other things that happen.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=176s)** — Number one, the depletion of potassium.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=178s)** — You start to become potassium deficient when you consume carbs.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=183s)** — Probably what happens is when you store this excess sugar, it gets stored as something called glycogen,
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=189s)** — which is basically a series of glucose molecules strung together with the help of potassium.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=195s)** — So you need potassium to store the sugar as glycogen in your liver and the muscles.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=202s)** — And so the more sugar you eat, the more potassium gets kind of stored away and stuck in this storage system of glucose called glycogen.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=211s)** — Two other things happen. You start to develop more sympathetic dominance.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=216s)** — That means that your fight or flight mechanism is more activated, and that's the stress mechanism.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=223s)** — Also, another thing is increased called renin. It's a hormone.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=228s)** — In both of these things, the sympathetics and renin retains sodium as well.
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=234s)** — So we have a lot happening in relationship to the holding of fluid and the retention of sodium and the depletion of potassium.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=242s)** — And of course, when you eat junk food, what's junk food?
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=245s)** — Sugar, starch, MSG, monosodium glutamate.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=250s)** — Boy, the next day you'll probably notice your eyes are puffy. That is what we're talking about.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=256s)** — If you want to know how to fix it, very simply, you want to get this sugar out of your diet.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=261s)** — And you can also start taking potassium and or start eating foods high in potassium.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=267s)** — If you want a really good video on exactly what to eat to help you with that, I put it up right here.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u3k5CUmiXU&t=274s)** — Check it out.
