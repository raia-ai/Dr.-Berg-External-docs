- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=0s)** — So what would be the perfect meal to help you detoxify your liver? That's what we're going to talk about today.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=7s)** — The first thing I want to mention is that going through a detox is not the same as a cleanse.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=14s)** — There's all these cleanses out there that say like a 14-day cleanse, clean out your liver, right?
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=19s)** — Well, don't waste your money. Going on a cleanse with cayenne pepper and lemon juice with maple syrup
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=26s)** — for even a week or two is not going to help you clean your liver. All these expensive little kits
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=33s)** — with these powdered herbs and things that you can take to cleanse your liver are not going to in
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=38s)** — any significant way clean your liver. And I'm going to explain why. You have some powerful,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=45s)** — amazing thing that happens in that cell. They go through like this assembly line of
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=52s)** — enzymatic changes. Okay? You've got phase one and phase two. And then phase three is just the
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=59s)** — full elimination of that toxin. And when I talk about toxins, I'm talking about drugs, medication,
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=67s)** — preservatives, xenobiotics, which are all the chemicals that are external to the body and
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=71s)** — foreign to the body. Like you have plastics, you have petroleum products, you have also mold
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=77s)** — and fungus and pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, fungicides. You have metabolic
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=82s)** — waste like hydrogen peroxide. You have toxins from smoking. I think there's over
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=87s)** — six or 7,000 different chemicals. Okay? With about I think 74 to 100
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=95s)** — carcinogens. Then you have chemicals in vaping. You have caffeine, heavy metals. I'm not
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=100s)** — sure if I mentioned that. Cleaning chemicals, alcohol, hormones that need to be broken down.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=105s)** — So we are basically swimming, bathing in chemicals 24-7, especially if you use tap water and it's
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=114s)** — like in your shower head and you have to drink that. And I mean, it's just it's hitting us
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=118s)** — from every different angle. Thank goodness we have this system of phase one, phase two
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=124s)** — detoxification. And the whole goal of this process is to turn poisons into harmless
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=133s)** — water-soluble particles. So in other words, a lot of these chemicals are fat-soluble. So let
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=141s)** — me explain fat-soluble. So you can see right here we have fat and we have water, right?
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=149s)** — You know they don't mix. This is the fat-soluble toxins right here. It goes into the body,
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=154s)** — but it doesn't come out. It gets stuck in there. So we need to turn this fat
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=159s)** — into something that's more water soluble so it can go through the body. So what these enzymes do
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=168s)** — is basically add something to the fat and then...
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=176s)** — and so they break it down into something that can actually go through the body.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=180s)** — Okay, this is another example that I use with like bile salts and what bile salts can do
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=185s)** — for fat. But it's a good analogy also for what these enzymes do to the fat-soluble poisons.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=194s)** — In phase one, they're adding either water, hydrogen, or oxygen to start to oxidize and
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=201s)** — break it down. The challenge with this phase one is that when this chemical is activated,
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=209s)** — it becomes more toxic, more dangerous, more of a carcinogen because you're adding oxygen
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=215s)** — and you're oxidizing it and you're opening it up. That's why we have phase two. But we need phase
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=221s)** — one to be able to dismantle this so that we can then add the next thing to this chain of
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=227s)** — events. So phase one kind of starts the process. It activates things. It requires certain
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=233s)** — nutrients like folate, vitamin C, certain B vitamins, calcium, etc. And this is also the
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=239s)** — where if you consume grapefruit juice or grapefruit and you're also taking a medication,
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=246s)** — there's a certain chemical in grapefruit that will retain that drug longer in your system
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=254s)** — and it will make things more toxic for you. So you never want to consume grapefruit juice
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=259s)** — or grapefruits while you're taking a certain medication. And during phase one, there's a lot
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=265s)** — of free radicals and oxidation happening and this is where you need a lot of antioxidants.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=271s)** — So antioxidants protect the cell against all this free radical stuff going on and detoxification
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=279s)** — is different because you're taking a poison and turning into a water-soluble harmless
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=284s)** — particle. Now after phase one gets a hold of that poison, then phase two comes in there
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=291s)** — and it does something called conjugation. Okay. And that's basically adding a water-soluble
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=297s)** — molecule to this compound. Like for example, glutathione. So glutathione binds with it and
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=304s)** — now it's water-soluble. And if you ever get a DNA test, you'll see all these detoxification
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=310s)** — enzymes and you can actually see if you have a problem with them genetically. Like say there's
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=315s)** — a mutation with one of those enzymes and what that means is there's some sluggishness
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=321s)** — and that enzyme doesn't work like it should. So it makes you more susceptible to damage from
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=330s)** — that poison if you're exposed to it. It's just going to be harder for your body to get rid of
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=335s)** — that toxin unless you eat very healthy and you do things to really avoid that toxin. So
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=341s)** — the value of a DNA test will tell you the importance of avoiding a certain toxin or
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=347s)** — going above and beyond what you normally do to eat certain things to help this process happen
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=353s)** — faster. And when I'm actually evaluating DNA testing, I'm finding a lot of people have a
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=357s)** — problem with these detoxification enzymes. So in phase one, okay, the name of this group of
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=364s)** — of enzymes are called the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Okay, and then in phase two,
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=370s)** — you have a bunch of other names involving glutathione, but I'm not going to get into
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=374s)** — these names at this point. Just realize that all these enzymes pretty much do the same thing
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=379s)** — but in different locations in the body and with different toxins. So like I said before,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=386s)** — there are detoxification enzymes in your intestines, in your lungs, in your kidney,
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=391s)** — but the liver is the primary area of detoxification. So with phase two,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=397s)** — you're attaching certain water soluble compounds to help it become more water soluble. And that
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=404s)** — involves sulfur, choline, certain amino acids, zinc. Now there's a couple points I'm going to
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=410s)** — talk about with this whole assembly line of enzymes to break down these chemicals. It really
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=418s)** — depends on how chronically you're exposed to these chemicals. For example, if you have a bad habit
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=424s)** — of smoking, okay, every day for a long period of time, that is going to be way more of a
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=429s)** — problem with these enzymes and the accumulation in chronic irritation and the side effects of
- **[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=435s)** — things like cancer. Because remember, cancer is this chronic irritation or damage to the
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=441s)** — mitochondria that then switches over into this out of control cancer cell. Well, something
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=447s)** — causes it and it's usually the chronic exposure to something and it can also be diet as well.
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=453s)** — And on top of that, if someone has a fatty liver, which the majority of population does,
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=459s)** — this phase one, phase two detoxification enzyme pathway just does not work like it should.
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=465s)** — Also, if they have inflammation in the liver, same thing like hepatitis,
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=469s)** — it just won't work that well. And especially if they have cirrhosis, it won't work that well.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=474s)** — Now, there's also a phase three detoxification where you're eliminating these water soluble
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=481s)** — chemicals throughout the body. But what if, for example, you are constipated, right? Your
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=487s)** — bowels hold on to these toxins. Well, that's a problem because they accumulate,
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=492s)** — especially if you have chronic constipation. And another thing you can have is like
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=496s)** — dysbiosis, which is an alteration in the gut microbiome. There's a gut-liver relationship
- **[08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=503s)** — that if there's something going on the gut, it's going to affect the liver because the friendly
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=507s)** — bacteria also assist in removing these chemicals. So if you had a lot of antibiotics or you have
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=514s)** — an overgrowth of yeast or a lot of problems with the gut microbiome, you can have a
- **[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=518s)** — problem with detoxification. Now, a little bit higher up in the digestion, you have these
- **[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=523s)** — bile ducts. Bile is one of the primary ways of eliminating these toxins, okay, as well as
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=529s)** — the urinary system. But if there's anything going on in the bile ducts where there's a blockage,
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=534s)** — that's called choleostasis, where there's just like sludge or an obstruction from a gallstone,
- **[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=540s)** — that can start accumulating these toxins in the liver and interrupt this flow that should
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=546s)** — normally happen. And the way that you would know that you would have that is usually like
- **[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=550s)** — right shoulder pain or a fullness underneath the right rib cage or burping or belching.
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=555s)** — And the remedy is to thin the bile with more bile. And I like to use a remedy called TADCA,
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=563s)** — which has been known to greatly assist in the detoxification process of the liver and
- **[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=569s)** — in other parts of the body. What about if the urine is obstructed? Okay, I mean,
- **[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=574s)** — let's say the person has a large prostate and they just don't eliminate like they should and
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=578s)** — they retain urine. Well, we have this accumulation of toxic material that just cannot exit the body
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=585s)** — and it backs up all the waste. Not to mention someone that having diabetes and having a kidney
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=591s)** — problem, which also causes them to retain these chemicals. But the question is, what can you do
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=596s)** — about it? What can you do? Well, the diet. Out of all the things you can do, and I'm
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=602s)** — talking about supplements and remedies and all this stuff, the diet can help you the most
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=608s)** — when you detoxify. And I'm not talking about a two-week cleanse. I'm talking about
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=614s)** — something you do on a routine basis, a consistent basis where you're eating these foods over and
- **[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=619s)** — over and over again. So I'm going to describe a meal that I think would be the best meal to help
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=624s)** — your liver and other organs detoxify. We want to start with the egg. Okay, eggs are one of
- **[10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=631s)** — the perfect foods because they're high in sulfur, complete amino acid profile. They pretty
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=637s)** — much have every nutrient including choline, which is really good for the liver as well as a
- **[10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=642s)** — fatty liver. And then you would cook those eggs with onions and garlic. Two things that are very
- **[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=648s)** — high in sulfur, not to mention all the antioxidants in onion and garlic that can help counter the
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=655s)** — phase one detoxification. And don't forget the sea salt to get some of the trace minerals. And
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=660s)** — then we add our cruciferous vegetables. Now, there's any number of cruciferous vegetables that
- **[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=665s)** — you can do. You can do roasted brussel sprouts. You can do cauliflower. Or you can do broccoli,
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=671s)** — steamed broccoli. Or even cabbage or sauerkraut. And if you want to do a salad, you can just do
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=677s)** — arugula. The more bitter the vegetable, the better for your liver. Out of all the salad greens,
- **[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=684s)** — arugula is at the top of the list because it's cruciferous. These cruciferous vegetables
- **[11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=689s)** — activate the genes that cause these enzymes to be produced and work. So if you have a genetic
- **[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=696s)** — mutation with one of these genes, consuming those foods can speed up this process. Now,
- **[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=702s)** — just so you know, this is my meal. This is what I eat very often as my first meal of the day.
- **[11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=707s)** — And then as a kind of a dessert, I'll have kefir, which is way better than yogurt. Then
- **[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=713s)** — I'll put some walnuts in there. And sometimes I might put some low carb, no sugar chocolate
- **[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=720s)** — chips, just a little bit. That's my dessert. But that can actually help with the calcium that
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=725s)** — you need as well as to your microbiome. What's unique about kefir is that it has a lot more
- **[12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=731s)** — friendly bacteria as well as friendly yeast, whereas yogurt has less bacteria and no friendly
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=737s)** — yeast. And of course, that's not the only meal, but that's just an example of something
- **[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=740s)** — that could be good. You definitely want enough protein too with complete amino acids,
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=746s)** — because all these enzymes are made from amino acids. So it's very, very important to have
- **[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=750s)** — some animal meat or eggs with your meal. And to put the icing on the cake,
- **[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=756s)** — I probably shouldn't talk about cake, add additional herbs if you can. If you can add
- **[12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=763s)** — thyme, sage, oregano, cayenne pepper, turmeric, rosemary, any of these herbs are going to
- **[12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=770s)** — help you in the detoxification process. Now, if you haven't seen this video on how to get
- **[12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vtMP3laIBc&t=776s)** — rid of a fatty liver, I put it up right here. Check it out.
