- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to show you how to cleanse your liver within three days.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=5s)** — I've done every single cleanse that has ever been invented.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=10s)** — And I'm going to tell you many many cleanses that I've done. I've gotten sick.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=14s)** — I start the cleanse and then I'm in bed for two weeks.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=17s)** — This particular liver cleanse that I'm going to talk about is very different
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=21s)** — than my usual cleanses that I talk about in a lot of other videos where I'm talking about
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=26s)** — drinking apple cider vinegar, lemon drinks, ginger, but they're not going to even produce
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=32s)** — close in results of what I'm going to show you today.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=35s)** — The question is how does your liver actually clean the body?
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=40s)** — What are the things that are the most powerful so we can speed this process up?
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=44s)** — We have the detoxification of the poisons and chemicals, whether it's medication,
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=49s)** — the chemicals in your food, alcohol, etc.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=53s)** — And then you have also the cleaning of all the dead cells, the waste,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=58s)** — the pathogens that are in your body. If you've ever taken biology,
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=62s)** — this is a cell and inside the cell you have these different things.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=66s)** — And this little thing right here is the garbage disposal of the cell.
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=71s)** — That's called a lysosome. A lysosome is the little incinerator,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=77s)** — the garbage disposal that burns up the waste and cleans up the dead cell.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=83s)** — And it actually helps recycle dead cells and pathogens like microbes and viruses and bacteria
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=90s)** — and fungus and turns all that into new cells. So that whole process is called autophagy.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=98s)** — So the body is actually eating some of its own tissue and it's recycling this waste into new
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=105s)** — cells. So let's go through the seven things that trigger autophagy, starting with the
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=110s)** — maybe the weakest trigger to autophagy. And that would be certain
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=115s)** — phytonutrients. It has a mild effect of triggering this autophagy, this recycling effect.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=120s)** — Then number six, we get the ketogenic diet, cutting down your carbohydrates.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=125s)** — Then number five, we get into exercise. Exercise will trigger autophagy. Then we get
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=130s)** — into sleep. Okay, when you sleep, you go through this process. Then we get into calorie restriction.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=138s)** — Okay, when you cut down your calories, that also helps this process to occur. And then
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=144s)** — number two, we have water fasting. And water fasting is basically you're not eating anything
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=149s)** — except you're drinking water. But there's one additional thing that is three times more
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=157s)** — than water fasting. And that is... are you sitting down?
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=164s)** — Dry fasting. No food in no water. Dry fasting hands down is probably one of the most
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=172s)** — powerful things you can do to stimulate autophagy and truly cleanse the cells.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=179s)** — And I'm not talking about doing dry fasting for 12 days. Okay, that's for a different video.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=184s)** — I'm talking about doing dry fasting for only a day. So in other words, you start dry fasting,
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=190s)** — sunrise, and then you stop at sunset. And at first, I didn't think there was anything to this.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=196s)** — But the more I got into it, I'm like, wow, this is incredible. Because one day of dry
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=203s)** — fasting is equivalent to three days of water fasting. You've probably been told that you
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=209s)** — only survive three days without water. I'm not going to get into that in this video,
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=215s)** — but that's a complete myth. That's absolutely not true. And that's just because when you
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=219s)** — stop drinking water, what happens is your fat cells, as they're burned, start releasing a lot
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=227s)** — of water. But my whole point on this is we're only talking about 12 hours of not drinking
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=231s)** — water. Okay, so you're going to be fine. You're going to greatly enhance your immune
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=236s)** — system. Another benefit is your kidneys and your liver finally have a chance to rest.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=244s)** — Sometimes we have this idea that we have to drink all this water to flush the toxins out.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=250s)** — Right? Guess what you're doing all day long when you're drinking a lot of water?
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=253s)** — You're peeing. Okay, so you're causing your kidneys to work really hard to get rid of this
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=259s)** — extra water. Another cool benefit is mental clarity. You're going to grow new brain cells
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=264s)** — when you do this. And another big benefit is your inflammation is going to come down.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=269s)** — And what's also cool about this is you're going to go to sleep and you're going to get
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=274s)** — more hours of dry fasting as well. This second part involves getting rid of
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=282s)** — toxins, poisons, chemicals. And this happens in the liver. It happens in the kidney. It
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=287s)** — happens in different parts of the body as well. You have these enzymes that go through
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=292s)** — series of steps that take the poisons and then they break them down to the point where they're
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=300s)** — harmless. And so this program is kind of like what's called OMAD, which is one meal a day.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=304s)** — What are you going to eat that one meal of the day? And by the way, you'll eat that
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=309s)** — when the sun sets. You're just going to eat two things. Some type of cruciferous vegetable
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=314s)** — and you're going to eat meat. Well, what is a cruciferous vegetable? Broccoli,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=319s)** — Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, arugula. Now you can do broccoli sprouts and that's going to be
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=328s)** — 20 to 50 times stronger than adult broccoli. And you can have that in a salad. That would be
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=333s)** — considered a great thing. You can do kale or even blend kale and you drink that as a shake.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=340s)** — Then you get something called bok choy. And then the other thing that I consume a lot is
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=344s)** — different forms. Raw sauerkraut is really awesome because it's fermented. So then we get to the
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=350s)** — meat part. Now meat is loaded with certain amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=357s)** — Some of these amino acids work in different ways. Like for example, glutamine helps build
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=362s)** — up your glutathione, which is the most powerful antioxidant in the cells to help you get rid of
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=368s)** — free radicals and things that create rusting in the body. Meat also has iron as well as
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=374s)** — the B vitamins, which also help you detox. And then if we add on top of that, this dry
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=380s)** — fasting, you have a sure winner to help clean out not just your liver and your kidneys,
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=387s)** — but the entire body. And you're going to do this three days, a month. Now one last point,
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=392s)** — how do we prevent the detox reaction that a lot of people get when they cleanse?
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=397s)** — Well, with this cleanse, we're not necessarily using herbal remedies to push toxins out of the
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=405s)** — cells. However, anytime you do any type of cleansing, anything, the key is making sure
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=412s)** — that you do not have any bile sludge or any type of blockage within the little bile ducts.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=419s)** — And those are little tubes between your liver and your gallbladder. You know, some people
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=423s)** — might have gallstones, but a lot of people have like gall sludge. And what happens is
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=429s)** — start a cleanse and it backs up to the liver and they get really sick. So it wouldn't hurt
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=434s)** — before you do this to take some bile salts, okay, in a supplement. You can also do
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=441s)** — another type of bile salt that I've recommended in other videos called
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=446s)** — Tudka. Okay, and I'll put that down below if you want more information on that.
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=449s)** — You can also use food to help thin the bile. One of the best things to thin the bile would be to
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=456s)** — consume beets. One last thing is apple cider vinegar with water. I've known of people who
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=460s)** — started to cleanse and they get this rock right stuck in their stomach and they become
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=466s)** — really severely constipated. And it happened after they started a cleanse. And the quick
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=472s)** — remedy that I always give them is some bile salts and on an empty stomach and that starts
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=477s)** — opening up the sludge and they get relief within hours. So don't forget that. Now since
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=483s)** — we're talking about the liver and phase one, phase two detoxification, there's a little bit
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=488s)** — more information about the liver that you really need to know about. And for that information,
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wd5a4veej8&t=493s)** — watch this video right here.
