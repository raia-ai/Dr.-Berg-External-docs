- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=0s)** — I wanted to do this quick video on how to get rid of painful periods, which are also called
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=6s)** — menstrual cramps, or known as period pain. They're all really the same thing. You have a
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=12s)** — cramping going on in the lower part of your body. Now the question is, what is cramping? Well,
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=19s)** — it's the uterus. Yes, the uterus can cramp. Because when you think about like even pregnancy,
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=23s)** — it's the uterus that contracts. Well, during your menstrual cycle, the uterus also contracts
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=29s)** — as well. And so we're dealing with a spasm of a muscle. There's a really quick thing that you can
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=35s)** — do to give relief to yourself. So what you do is just lay on your stomach. That's called a prone
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=39s)** — position. And then you put your arms up and you stretch backwards, hyper extending your lower back,
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=47s)** — which will stretch out the uterus in front of your back. So that's the quick thing to give
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=52s)** — you immediate relief. And it will help if you can do it. Sometimes it's so painful that you
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=56s)** — can't even do that. But at least that's something I would attempt as a first thing.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=61s)** — All right, so now you can't keep stretching all day long. So what can you do to really get to
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=66s)** — the root of the problem? If you look up painful periods or menstrual cramps, you will
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=72s)** — always see this word prostaglandins. Well, it's a chemical that signals certain parts of
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=81s)** — do certain things like create inflammation. And this is why prostaglandins are behind inflammation
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=88s)** — in the brain. And when people take medication like ibuprofen for pain or a headache, it is
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=95s)** — blocking these prostaglandins. But there's different types of prostaglandins. And the
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=98s)** — one that we're going to talk about has a very specific purpose of causing a vasoconstriction
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=104s)** — in the uterus if it's too high. And I will get into why it's too high in a minute. But
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=110s)** — let's talk about what you can do to inhibit or lower prostaglandins. Most people take
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=117s)** — ibuprofen. Okay, and it does work. The problem is there's side effects. There's a lot of side
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=121s)** — effects that can affect your stomach and create other issues, which I don't want to get into.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=126s)** — But what I do want to get into is an alternative similar to ibuprofen that has virtually
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=131s)** — no side effects. There is one study and I'll put the link down below that showed the
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=135s)** — of ibuprofen to this remedy. Okay, and it was very, very close. Ibuprofen did win out in
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=143s)** — being more effective. But initially, both of those proved to be very, very similar or compatible
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=148s)** — in effectiveness. And the remedy is cinnamon. That's right. So just sprinkle a little cinnamon
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=153s)** — and sugar on your toast and you'll be good to go. And I'm being very sarcastic. The type
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=158s)** — of cinnamon that you want, is it going to be in a capsule? Okay, because you need to get
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=162s)** — a gram or 1000 milligrams and you're going to take that three times a day. But cinnamon has
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=168s)** — a lot of different properties for regulating blood sugars. But in this situation, it gives an
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=173s)** — anti-spasmodic effect. Okay, it gets rid of spasms and it could help you reduce inflammation.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=180s)** — Why? Because it lowers prostaglandins, the specific ones that are affecting the uterus.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=186s)** — Now, the question you're probably asking right now is why are these prostaglandins
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=189s)** — too high in the first place? It's really in a balance with two hormones. We have an excessively
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=197s)** — lowered amount of progesterone and we have too much estrogen. That is the combination
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=203s)** — that creates this problem. And it just so happens that cinnamon lowers estrogen and it
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=212s)** — increases progesterone. So it not only affects that prostaglandin, but it helps to go deeper.
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=219s)** — A couple other things that I recommend that also will directly inhibit prostaglandins. Vitamin D3
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=225s)** — and I would take about 10,000 IUs three times a day throughout the day. At the same time,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=231s)** — you're taking the cinnamon as well as calcium and magnesium together. And the vitamin D helps
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=237s)** — the absorption of the calcium and the magnesium go into the tissues, helping to relax the spasm.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=245s)** — Vitamin D is also a potent anti-inflammatory as well. And the third thing that might be very
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=250s)** — beneficial is Omega 3 fatty acids in the form of cod liver oil. Omega 3 is a natural
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=258s)** — pain reliever, a natural anti-inflammatory. So now you have a very potent solution
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=263s)** — for menstrual cramps or period pain. Now because of the censoring and the suppressing
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=269s)** — of the algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=274s)** — a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube unfortunately. So to make sure you have full
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=279s)** — access of all my information, go to DrBurglar.com and subscribe to my newsletter by clicking the
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=285s)** — link down below in the description. I will see you on the other side. So now that you know
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=290s)** — that, the question is what actually is behind this imbalance of too much estrogen and not
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HEr110HKg&t=296s)** — enough progesterone? And for that, I put this video up right here. Check it out.
