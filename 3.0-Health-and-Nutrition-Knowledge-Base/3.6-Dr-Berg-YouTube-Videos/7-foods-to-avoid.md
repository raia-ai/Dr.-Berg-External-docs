- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the foods that you definitely need to avoid if you have a thyroid problem,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=6s)** — specifically a hypothyroid condition. And so the biggest thing that you need to be aware of
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=11s)** — are these things called goitrogens. Now what is a goitrogen? It's things that cause a goiter.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=19s)** — Okay, now what is a goiter? Basically a goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland and the thyroid
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=24s)** — gland is right at the bottom of your neck about two and a half inches wide. So when
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=28s)** — things start swelling up, that's called a goiter. And there are foods that cause that. And those are
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=34s)** — the foods that you need to avoid because what they do is they interfere with certain enzymes
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=39s)** — and they stimulate certain enzymes and they increase certain other hormones. Like they
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=45s)** — increase the thyroid stimulating hormone which comes down from the pituitary and then it makes
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=51s)** — the thyroid actually get bigger. So there are many different aspects to what a goiter can do
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=57s)** — for the thyroid. But I'm just going to make you aware of what these goiter foods are specifically.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=63s)** — All right, number one, cassava. Cassava is a goitrogenic food. Number two, lima beans.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=70s)** — Number three, sorghum, which is a type of grain. Number four, sweet potato. Number five,
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=78s)** — flax seed. Number six, cruciferous vegetables. And that would include broccoli, kale,
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=84s)** — brussels sprouts, cabbage, radish, watercress, bok choy, cauliflower,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=93s)** — horseradish, and arugula. But you do want to avoid consuming a lot of cruciferous. But if
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=98s)** — you're consuming like small amounts like less than five ounces, you're not going to have a
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=104s)** — problem. Okay, I'm talking about large amounts. And even if you do have cruciferous, if you
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=109s)** — cook them or steam them or ferment them, as in sauerkraut, you're going to reduce the amount of
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=115s)** — this effect. And also if you have a little sea kelp, that will also help as well. I mean,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=120s)** — if you look at the research, you would have to consume a good amount of this over a period of
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=123s)** — time to create a goiter. I'm just bringing up all the foods because you may be consuming
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=129s)** — a lot of these foods, maybe not individually in large amounts, but across the board.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=133s)** — Another one is a grain called millet. The next big one is soy. Tofu, soy milk especially,
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=142s)** — soy protein, isolates, any soy. Now the next one might surprise you, but onions are the food
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=149s)** — that have the most quercetin. And quercetin can give you a goitrogenic effect. So if you
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=155s)** — have a goiter, you probably should be careful about consuming too many onions. Now this
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=160s)** — last thing I want to talk about isn't classically considered a goitrogen, but it definitely destroys
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=168s)** — the thyroid especially the autoimmune thyroid Hashimoto's. In fact, 90% of all hypothyroid
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=175s)** — cases are Hashimoto's. And the biggest culprit is this gluten in grains, a lot of different
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=183s)** — grains. So gluten is something you have to avoid. Now the question is why? This is related
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=189s)** — to an area called molecular mimicry. If you have antibodies to gluten, which a lot of people do,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=196s)** — those antibodies can cross over and start to attack the thyroid because of this
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=203s)** — molecular similarity. Now when dealing with the thyroid, you would also want to avoid
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=208s)** — anything that depletes selenium, iodine, iron, and vitamin A. These are key nutrients
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=216s)** — that you want sufficient amounts. So to get enough iodine and selenium, that would be all the seafood,
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=222s)** — that would be also the sea kelp, Brazil nuts, and also you can get both of these if you do
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=226s)** — sea salt. Of course iron is pretty easy to get if you're doing like red meat or animal
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=232s)** — products. And vitamin A, you can get that from egg yolks, butter, cod liver oil, beef liver,
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=240s)** — things like that. Now that I talked about what foods to avoid,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJG0kYFUIyE&t=244s)** — let's talk about what you should eat. And for that, check this video out.
