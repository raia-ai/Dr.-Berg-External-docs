- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=0s)** — Hey, Dr. Berg here again. Today we are going to talk about the 7 visible signs that you have hormonal imbalance.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=7s)** — And you can see these things very easily when you look in the mirror.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=10s)** — At the end of this video, you are going to be able to look across the room and observe something.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=15s)** — And pretty much know if that person has too much of a certain hormone or not enough.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=20s)** — Let's first start out with the thyroid gland. Your thyroid gland is like right here. It's like
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=24s)** — 2.5 inches wide. The thyroid is a small gland, but it controls your metabolism.
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=28s)** — If these hormones are too high, your eyes are actually going to start bulging out.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=34s)** — Your metabolism is going to be very fast to the point where you are going to lose a lot of weight.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=38s)** — This is not a good thing because it's going to be a very unhealthy weight loss.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=44s)** — And you might see a lot of sweating with a hyperthyroid problem.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=47s)** — On the flip side, if the thyroid is not working enough, that's called a hypothyroid condition.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=54s)** — This is going to cause more weight gain. And the hair, you are going to see that the hair is going to be
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=58s)** — thin. It's going to be dry. 90% of hypothyroidism is a type of thyroid problem that is related to
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=65s)** — the immune system. It's called Hashimoto's. It's an autoimmune condition where your own body
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=71s)** — is creating antibodies against your own thyroid, destroying it, creating an underactive thyroid
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=77s)** — coming from the immune system. A very important thing about that condition is to avoid gluten
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=83s)** — from grains. You need to take more selenium. You can get enough selenium from having one
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=88s)** — Brazil nut. Selenium also improves the immune system and so does vitamin D. So you're going to
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=93s)** — need high doses of vitamin D3 for Hashimoto's. Let's move to number two, which is androgens.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=100s)** — One is testosterone and the other is DHT. If there's too much androgen, you're going to get
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=108s)** — acne around your jawline, around your back, and both men and women. In women, their voice is
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=115s)** — more deeper, more facial hair. And they will also start noticing receding in the top part of their
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=121s)** — hair versus if men have too much androgen, they'll start having male pattern baldness.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=127s)** — This is why it's so important to avoid carbohydrates, sugars, starches, and also not
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=133s)** — to eat so frequently. On the flip side, if someone doesn't have enough androgen, let's say
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=140s)** — men, if they're low in testosterone, they're going to get lowered amount of muscle. Men will
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=146s)** — also lose hair on the bottom part of their legs if they don't have enough testosterone.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=152s)** — The other thing is to avoid plastics. So you want to get a really good water filter
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=156s)** — because that's where most people get their plastics from city water. Let's move to number
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=161s)** — three, cortisol. Cortisol is a stress hormone and if it goes too high, you're going to
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=170s)** — get like a buffalo hump on the back part of your neck. You'll tend to gain weight
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=175s)** — in your midsection. In females, a lot of times you'll see exaggerated stretch marks from too
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=182s)** — much cortisol. Cortisol will age you. It makes your skin thin and wrinkly. Number four is
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=189s)** — estrogen. What happens when the estrogen goes high? Your face will be puffy. You might see
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=198s)** — melasma, which is this pigmentation thing on your skin. You might see little patches of a
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=203s)** — darker complexion, but you can also see estrogen dominance from someone on birth control pills
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=208s)** — or estrogen replacement therapy. What happens when your estrogen goes down during menopause,
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=214s)** — for example? The skin and collagen start to disappear. This is why you start looking older
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=220s)** — or you get wrinkles or the skin looks thinner. You also have to realize that estrogen comes
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=224s)** — from cholesterol. So if you're on something that lowers cholesterol or you're on a low-fat diet,
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=230s)** — that could be a major reason why your estrogen also is excessively low. Number five,
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=237s)** — growth hormone. Typically, if your growth hormone declines too much, it's just going
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=240s)** — to make you look older and it's also going to affect your muscle. When growth hormone goes
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=245s)** — down, we gain weight, especially in the midsection. A couple things to know about
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=250s)** — growth hormone. To increase it, it's the intensity of the exercise. So sprinting or
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=256s)** — anything high intensity, short duration. Also keeping your carbs low will help increase
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=262s)** — your growth hormone. Also sleeping more can help your growth hormone because the majority
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=267s)** — of your growth hormone occurs when you're sleeping. This is another reason why some people
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=271s)** — age more quickly. Their sleep is poor. If your sleep is poor, you are going to look older.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=278s)** — Number six, progesterone. Progesterone goes up. It's actually very, very rare. Probably have some
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=284s)** — mild fluid retention. A much more common problem is when it goes too low, which is super common.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=289s)** — Those symptoms would be a puffy face, the person will look dull and tired, and sometimes
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=294s)** — have acne. Number seven, insulin. What visual signs occur when your insulin is too high?
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=299s)** — Well, number one, you're going to have a midsection that's going to stick out. You're
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=306s)** — going to get rid of it. Skin tags, swollen eyes. If we shift gears to low insulin,
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=313s)** — that's when you're actually losing too much weight. But again, not in a healthy way.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=316s)** — You see this in a type one diabetic. Now we have an issue of craving for carbs,
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=321s)** — being hungry all the time. The big thing that triggers insulin is sugar and starches,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=327s)** — as in bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, biscuits, waffles, pancakes, and also just the
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=332s)** — meals. This is why telling someone to consume a balanced diet, or this concept of everything
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=340s)** — in moderation is the worst advice ever. Out of all these hormonal imbalances, the one that I see
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=346s)** — most commonly as a problem is too much cortisol. How to bring it down naturally
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFWspXbN8jY&t=352s)** — and keep it normal. So watch this video right now.
