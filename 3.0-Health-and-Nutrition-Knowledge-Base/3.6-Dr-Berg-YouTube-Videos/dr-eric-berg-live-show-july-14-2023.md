- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=36s)** — Welcome back everyone. We are here with another Q&A. We are going to talk about everything
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=40s)** — keto and you guys might have some additional questions. Anything that I say is definitely
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=44s)** — not meant to replace your medical care check with your doctor before implementing any of
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=49s)** — the things we are going to talk about. We have some great people in the green room
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=53s)** — as well as people on social media. So bring your questions and let's get started.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=57s)** — Okay, very good. We do have a great one. And also this is a milestone for us. We have in
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=63s)** — Dr. Berg show history the longest single question in terms of word count of any other
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=69s)** — one. So that's very exciting news for all of you. We will get to that shortly. But
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=73s)** — why don't we jump all... we love everyone, green room participants, of course Dr. Berg
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=77s)** — and also social media. So why don't we kick it off with some social media questions
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=82s)** — to begin with. And let's start with Robbie from YouTube. Please discuss the best ways
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=87s)** — to naturally cleanse the liver. I've heard a regimen of olive oil, Epsom salts, and
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=92s)** — citrus juice is very effective. Any comments on that, Doc?
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=97s)** — Yeah, just one thing you need to know about the liver. It's not a storage of
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=102s)** — toxins. It doesn't store toxins. The fat maybe in the liver might store toxins,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=108s)** — but not the liver itself. It's a detoxifying machine. So it goes through this whole
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=116s)** — biochemical enzyme pathway, two different phases, or actually three different phases,
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=121s)** — to be able to turn poisons into harmless particles. So how can you increase that?
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=128s)** — Well, you want to strengthen the liver. Cruciferous vegetables also can help
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=135s)** — stimulate your own genes to actually detoxify. And there's also things in
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=141s)** — those cruciferous that can help dismantle poisons as well. So you have the cruciferous
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=146s)** — vegetables. Now as far as lemons, yes, lemon is definitely a great thing to help
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=152s)** — that process. You also have olive oil can help that process as well. It supports
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=159s)** — the liver. But you have many of the different herbs, like milk thistle, stinging
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=164s)** — nettle root, anything bitter, dandelion greens, arugula. Any of these bitter
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=172s)** — vegetables are really good to help increase the ability for that liver to
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=178s)** — detoxify and get rid of poisons.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=181s)** — Very good. Okay, good luck with that, sir. Steve from YouTube, I've lost
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=185s)** — 65, excuse me, 62 pounds on healthy keto and intermittent fasting.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=189s)** — I have to ring that. And let's see he says but he's got crepe skin C R E P E Terry
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=198s)** — Is that right? Does that make sense? crepe skin? And wants to know on his arms
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=203s)** — and so on and wants to know how to get rid of it.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=206s)** — A couple things related to that. You may want to make sure that you have
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=213s)** — electrolytes to hold the fluid in your tissue so your tissues are not
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=218s)** — too dehydrated. Also, you want to make sure you have enough of the right fats,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=223s)** — not just the saturated fats to come with the keto, but also the omega-3
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=227s)** — fatty acids. That might be helpful as well. And then you may want to just
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=232s)** — raise your carb level up to but not more than 50 grams because the
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=237s)** — carbs tend to increase water retention. Okay, a little bit more.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=243s)** — This is why I like bodybuilders might go into competition and carb load,
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=248s)** — which I don't recommend you do. But just we're talking just raise the
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=251s)** — carbs up a little bit. You just the carb load tends to it doesn't increase
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=256s)** — muscle. It basically increases a fullness around your body. So you so
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=262s)** — you hold more fluid. And that might just handle it right there.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=266s)** — Interesting. Now I can visualize the crepe skin sort of rippled or something
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=271s)** — like that. Well, good luck with that, Steve. But congratulations again on a
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=275s)** — tremendous weight loss. That's healthy. The other is just an annoyance,
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=280s)** — I'm sure. Jane from Zambia on YouTube, I am on peripheral neuropathy
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=288s)** — supplements. Boy, couldn't get that out. That have 18 milligrams of
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=292s)** — calcium citrate. Can I increase my intake to support bone growth?
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=298s)** — Well, peripheral neuropathy is if you're done supplements for that,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=303s)** — then you want to take more calcium for bones two different problems.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=308s)** — To build bone, you really want it's not just about calcium. I would
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=313s)** — recommend having the full array of trace minerals to build bone, make
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=319s)** — sure you have enough of the amino acids high quality amino acids from
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=323s)** — animal meats, specifically red meat. And then also, you definitely
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=329s)** — need calcium for sure. But also the vitamins that help the calcium
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=334s)** — go into the bones like vitamin K two. And so where do you get that?
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=340s)** — That's from sauerkraut, cheese, which then you can also get the
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=344s)** — calcium as well. fatty liver, things like that, that'll give you
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=350s)** — And of course, don't forget vitamin D. So you can get that from the sun,
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=355s)** — a caliber oil, or a supplement. Those are the things that I would
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=357s)** — focus on if you want to strengthen the bone. Of course, the
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=360s)** — peripheral neuropathy, that would be a combination of benfotamine
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=364s)** — and alpha lipoic acid.
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=367s)** — All right. Now, I just don't know of many other shows that have
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=370s)** — the worldwide support and viewership that the Dr. Berks show has.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=374s)** — And once again, here's today's evidence of that. A good morning
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=378s)** — to all of our viewers joining us today from the UK, Canada. By the
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=382s)** — way, we got a couple of folks in the green room from Canada,
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=384s)** — Mexico, Zambia, Jordan, Switzerland, the Czech Republic,
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=388s)** — Chile, South Africa, India, Japan, Colombia, the Netherlands,

- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=396s)** — the Philippines, Sweden, Australia, France, Taiwan, Brazil,
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=400s)** — the Virgin Islands, Indonesia, the Ukraine, excuse me, the
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=405s)** — Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine,
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=407s)** — New Zealand, Peru, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Poland, Ireland,
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=410s)** — Bermuda, Oman, Trinidad and Tobago, Norway, Austria, Greece,
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=415s)** — Dubai, Martis, Uganda, Spain, Albania, Aratria, Israel,
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=422s)** — Croatia, Kurdistan, Bulgaria, Turkey, Finland, Kashmir,
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=427s)** — Iran, Qatar, Armenia, Bahrain, Yugoslavia, Hong Kong,
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=432s)** — Moldova, Tanzania, Russia, Portugal, Scotland, Thailand,
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=436s)** — and of course all across these United States of America. And I'm always
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=439s)** — really nervous to read that because our producer Terry is a broadcast,
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=445s)** — degree, an English major, and he's a real grammarian. And he always catches me on
- **[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=451s)** — mispronouncing something. So I'm just in an absolute sweat and panic each week as I
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=455s)** — read that for fear that I have somehow butchered the English language or foreign
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=461s)** — pronunciations of countries. So Terry, I'm doing the best I can. Trish from Facebook,
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=466s)** — is mushroom coffee a good alternative for a regular coffee? I think it is. I think it is. I
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=473s)** — kind of wish I never started drinking coffee, but now I'm addicted. So
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=477s)** — but yeah, mushrooms, there's some fascinating benefits with these different mushroom
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=482s)** — beverages and supplements from anti-aging to anti-cancer to incredible cognitive function as
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=489s)** — well. So I would definitely go that route if you're not addicted like myself.
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=495s)** — Okay, very good. And speaking of our grammarian, Terry sent me a message that
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=500s)** — crepe is pronounced crepe. So it's crepe skin. Thank you for that, Terry, that public humiliation.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=506s)** — Alberto from YouTube, if the absorbic acid form of vitamin C is not good for us, how do
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=514s)** — we get the best forms of vitamin C without using fresh fruits and fresh fruit juices?
- **[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=521s)** — You can get them from fresh vegetables like the bell pepper. Bell peppers are loaded. And also
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=529s)** — you're going to get vitamin C in all the vegetables and onions, salad, as well as
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=535s)** — lemons, juice the whole lemon. And then you can also get it from sauerkraut.
- **[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=542s)** — That would be a good source. And berries are some berries are acceptable on the ketogenic diet.
- **[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=548s)** — Okay, very good. Here is the first quiz question of the day, Dr. Berg.
- **[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=553s)** — Okay. All right, question. Which part of the lemon contains most of the nutrition?
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=561s)** — I'm scared of what you're going to say. But there it is, doc, which is
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=565s)** — our audience, excuse me, which is the most nutritious part, the delicious
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=568s)** — inner part or something else, maybe who knows? Okay, let's go back once again to social media.
- **[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=576s)** — Matt from YouTube, what is the best way to remove toxic metals from our skin cells so that
- **[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=581s)** — our immune system can properly do its job? So he's filled with shrapnel.
- **[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=587s)** — The first thing to do is to find out the source where it's coming from and avoid that.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=591s)** — And the second thing is cilantro happens to be a good
- **[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=596s)** — remedy for toxic metals, as well as
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=603s)** — drinking distilled water. That will help as well. But then you can put the minerals that
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=610s)** — you want back into the body. But I did a complete video on it. Heavy metals is a problem,
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=616s)** — for sure. And so there's many different hidden sources and it can really mess you up.
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=623s)** — Unfortunately, because of the food supply, it grows in things that have runoffs from different
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=633s)** — chemical companies. We're exposed to these toxic pollutants and not just heavy metals,
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=641s)** — but all sorts of plastics and things like that. So there's other things you can use too.
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=651s)** — I can't recall, but there's many different remedies. But I think those two would be a good start.
- **[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=658s)** — All right, very good. Felipe from Facebook, besides physical therapy,
- **[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=663s)** — what would you recommend to alleviate the horrible, I put that in, symptoms of sciatica?
- **[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=670s)** — Well, you can try chiropractic. But I have a lot of videos on sciatica. I think
- **[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=678s)** — the sciatic nerve is composed of more than one nerve and it branches from your lower lumbar to
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=685s)** — the lower sacrum. And it comes out through a little... it bundles into one nerve,
- **[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=691s)** — which is the largest nerve of the body. And it comes right up through your butt and up
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=693s)** — through a little notch that goes down the back of the leg. So usually what happens is
- **[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=698s)** — some type of pinching in the lumbar area could be part of a protruded disc or some scar tissue
- **[11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=708s)** — in that area. So what you can do is you can keep that curve arched inward. So you want to
- **[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=717s)** — take a lumbar support or some type of cushion or foam roller, lay in your lower back to keep
- **[12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=722s)** — that curve in there. Because when you lose the curve, you start putting undue pressure on
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=727s)** — lower back. There's also certain vitamin deficiency things that can be related to that as well. I do
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=734s)** — videos on that. But I think the most important thing is to keep that curve in there. And
- **[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=739s)** — you don't want to necessarily stretch your hamstring on the same side you have that
- **[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=744s)** — pain. You want to stretch in the opposite way. So if you just stretch your thigh muscle,
- **[12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=749s)** — that would give you probably more relief. But I will say that long term sitting or driving
- **[12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=755s)** — just can really aggravate that sciatic nerve. All right, well, good luck with that. We hope
- **[12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=762s)** — that you can get over that Felipe. It's an awful thing. I've suffered from that. But we
- **[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=767s)** — have not suffered from an unresponsive audience because they already have the answer to quiz
- **[12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=772s)** — question number one, which asks which part of the lemon contains the most nutritious part.
- **[12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=779s)** — And 98% of the respondents say it's the skin of the rind of the lemon yuck and 2% say it's
- **[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=785s)** — seeds. No one voted for the gushy part. They are correct. So if you're going to eat a lemon,
- **[13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=793s)** — just eat the rind and the seeds and throw the rest away. Well, there's some vitamin C in the
- **[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=798s)** — pith or not. Yeah, the pith, I think it's called the meat of that lemon. So yeah,
- **[13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=804s)** — there's vitamin C in there. But and it's kind of a trick question, because I didn't tell
- **[13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=808s)** — what nutrients. So mainly the flavonoids. Flavonoids are a general term of over,
- **[13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=816s)** — I think, six to 8,000 to even more different molecules. So there's quite a few. And that's
- **[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=823s)** — what lemons are known for, especially the little white part underneath the rind.
- **[13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=828s)** — So this is this is why the best way to consume a lemon is to blend it
- **[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=835s)** — in the water. But you can still do that you're going to get some nutrition, but you're going
- **[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=840s)** — to get probably 10 times more if you blend the whole lemon and I put a little face minerals or I
- **[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=845s)** — might put a couple drops of stevia or a little couple blueberries drink that drink down. It's
- **[14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=850s)** — really good. If you if you ever drink lemonade, sweet lemonade, you have to try,
- **[14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=859s)** — try this blending a lemon and putting a couple drops maybe a little bit of lemon juice in
- **[14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=863s)** — it. And then you can add a little bit of lemon juice. And then you can add maybe 10 drops of
- **[14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=864s)** — stevia in there. I swear you this is like the totally acceptable version of lemonade that you
- **[14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=870s)** — can have. And I think you'd really enjoy it. And if you don't want to blend it, just take
- **[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=874s)** — the juice from it and add that stevia. And it's a great alternative to the sweetened
- **[14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=880s)** — lemonade that so many people consume. All right, I'm going to blast one up in the blender this
- **[14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=885s)** — afternoon and try it out. Now, would you also add water to that once you blast all of this?
- **[14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=889s)** — Yes, yes. Yeah, add add a couple or two of water for sure. All right. I'll report back
- **[14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=895s)** — with my findings. Carrie from YouTube. What's the best form of potassium supplements,
- **[15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=900s)** — potassium chloride or potassium citrate? I like the citrate because the citrate
- **[15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=907s)** — is something that is involved in our mitochondrial
- **[15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=911s)** — Krebs cycle pathway. And it kind of gives the raw material for everything else to work.
- **[15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=917s)** — And citrates also bind with oxalates, which actually prevent kidney stones. So you have a
- **[15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=923s)** — couple other nice things about that citrate that can help you. But I will say this,
- **[15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=929s)** — when you buy a potassium citrate, a lot of people just get it in electrolyte powder.
- **[15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=934s)** — Be wary of the manufacturing of that product, because a lot of companies get the cheaper
- **[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=941s)** — version and it's loaded with Maltodextrin. Now, how would you know if that powder, that
- **[15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=949s)** — potassium powder that you have that's loaded with this starch, all you have to do is put
- **[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=955s)** — some water in it, put in a little glass and then put a couple drops of iodine in it.
- **[16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=961s)** — And if there's starch in there, it'll turn dark purple. If there's not, it'll just stay
- **[16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=969s)** — yellow or almost transparent. So I did a video on that and you'd be shocked to find out how many
- **[16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=976s)** — companies have this hidden Maltodextrin. Maltodextrin, think about this, on the glycemic
- **[16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=982s)** — index, sugar is like 70, what, 73 or 74. Glucose is 100. Maltodextrin is like 110 to 130.
- **[16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=993s)** — So it's way, way, way worse than actual sugar, but it's not even classified as a sugar.
- **[16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=999s)** — They made it as a starch for probably marketing purposes, so you wouldn't see this hidden sugar.
- **[16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1007s)** — Interesting. Okay, well now, drum roll, it's time to go to our wonderful green room
- **[16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1012s)** — with the all-female cast today. We're going to start off with Stacey in Alberta, Canada. And
- **[16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1018s)** — Stacey, I'm going to unmute you if you'll do the same thing. And she's going to ask you one
- **[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1023s)** — question in 30 seconds and get a great answer. Go ahead. Okay, go ahead, hit it.
- **[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1029s)** — Hi, I've been watching you. April 23rd of this year, I started keto, intermittent fasting,
- **[17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1036s)** — quit drinking, blah, blah, blah. I've lost 60 pounds. In that strict, I went through all my
- **[17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1045s)** — cupboards. Anyways, that's not my question, but I'm on it. So a year and a half ago,
- **[17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1050s)** — I had a hip replacement on my left hip. And I was supposed to get another hip replacement on my
- **[17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1059s)** — right hip. But three days after I started doing the keto intermittent fasting, I haven't
- **[17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1065s)** — taken one pill or nothing for it. Yeah, like I'm everybody knows about you in my world. I'm
- **[17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1074s)** — just wondering, is there any way I can prevent from having another hip replacement?
- **[18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1080s)** — Well, you're not hurting, right? I mean, no, not at all. Now. Here's the thing, I would ride the
- **[18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1086s)** — wave because that's a major surgery. And you know how the recovery is for that. So I mean,
- **[18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1092s)** — the fact that you went on keto, you dropped your inflammation, things can start healing in
- **[18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1097s)** — that area. Let's say worst case scenario, you can also even possibly do some stem cell,
- **[18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1103s)** — there's some miraculous stuff done with that if you need it. But I think I would ride the
- **[18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1109s)** — wave. I've had patients come in to see me when I was in practice, bone on bone. And yet,
- **[18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1115s)** — they're doing fine. So yeah, you know, if you don't have pain, I think I would,
- **[18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1121s)** — I think a lot of people who were in your boat would be shocked to find out if they
- **[18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1126s)** — just change their diet, how much inflammation will go away. Oh, exactly. Exactly. It is,
- **[18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1132s)** — it is phenomenal. And my brain function, I think way better than I've ever thought.
- **[18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1138s)** — That's so great. Yeah. And the you can of course support, there's a lot of joint formulas out
- **[19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1145s)** — there with the chondrodontin sulfate and glucosamine, you can take those as well. But
- **[19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1153s)** — it's all... Oh, I'm so glad you said about the sauerkraut. I eat that every day. I love
- **[19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1159s)** — sauerkraut. And I grow microgreens. And I sell them because of you. Awesome. Yeah. And
- **[19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1166s)** — on top of that, you're from Alberta, which is even more awesome because I've been through
- **[19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1170s)** — there. It's beautiful. Yeah. I went up to see Lake Banff. I think it's called... Oh, Banff.
- **[19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1175s)** — Yeah. Lake Louise. Yeah. Actually Waterton is nicer. Oh, nice. Yes. Okay. And not too
- **[19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1184s)** — Okay. Now listen, I just want to show off her microgreens. So I shifted the camera. There
- **[19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1189s)** — they are baking away in the background. And that's not all of them. Wow. Great job.
- **[19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1196s)** — You betcha. People love them. I'm spreading the word. You're my hero. Yeah. Thank you.
- **[20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1204s)** — I appreciate you. Thank you. All right. Thanks so much, Stacey. You did very well with the
- **[20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1209s)** — questioning protocol. And we're very proud of you for that. So let's see. Let's move on to...
- **[20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1215s)** — What time is it? It's time for quiz question number two. And this drum roll is what I said
- **[20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1221s)** — the longest in history by word count question, but it's a fun one. And here you go.
- **[20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1228s)** — Okay. So definition of medical misinformation, A, false misleading or inaccurate medical
- **[20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1236s)** — information, or B, anything that conflicts with the World Health Organization Foundation,
- **[20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1242s)** — or now it's World Health Organization, not foundation, or general medical consensus.
- **[20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1250s)** — What's the answer? What's the true answer of that? All right, audience. I know you're on it.
- **[20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1255s)** — And let's go back to social media. Let's see. Katrina from Facebook. Which foods and protocols
- **[21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1265s)** — would you suggest for someone with Dupitrins, he phonetically did that for Dupitrins,
- **[21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1273s)** — contracture, a condition in which one or more fingers becomes permanently bent in a flexed
- **[21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1279s)** — position. Ouch. So there's a couple different theories of it. They don't really know exactly
- **[21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1286s)** — why it is. But I will say that I would take, because we have a contracture, I would take
- **[21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1295s)** — magnesium first. Okay. Well, you can take different versions. Glycosinate is a good
- **[21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1302s)** — type of magnesium. And I wouldn't also avoid calcium. I would probably take the calcium.
- **[21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1309s)** — Usually you can get magnesium with calcium in there. And that way you have the minerals to
- **[21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1313s)** — allow the contraction and relaxation of muscles. Now, the other point about this
- **[21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1318s)** — is that if your pH is too on the alkaline side, that can create these minerals from
- **[22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1327s)** — working correctly. So you may find that if you acidify the body with either ongoing
- **[22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1332s)** — apple cider vinegar and or butane hydrochloride, you can take it when you eat with your
- **[22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1338s)** — digestive system. You may find that that allows us minerals to work a lot better as well. So
- **[22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1343s)** — it's either a pH problem, I'm guessing, or a mineral problem between magnesium and calcium.
- **[22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1351s)** — Very good. So Sean from Facebook writes, bless you, dude. Canada loves you. I've lost 80
- **[22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1358s)** — pounds thanks to your intermittent fasting videos. Exclamation mark. And there you go,
- **[22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1363s)** — Sean. You get a couple of those. That's terrific. What a great story. And there's
- **[22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1367s)** — thousands of those. I didn't lose 80 pounds, but I'm down about 45 and never felt better. So
- **[22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1372s)** — that's terrific. Now the audience's promise has
- **[22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1378s)** — bared through the entire huge question number two, which asks definition of medical
- **[23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1383s)** — misinformation. A. False misleading or inaccurate medical information or B.
- **[23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1390s)** — Anything that conflicts with the World Health Organization or general medical consensus. And
- **[23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1397s)** — 50% there's a split of our respondents say it's A and 50% say it's B.
- **[23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1403s)** — Well, according to YouTube, it's B. So in other words, anything that doesn't align with World
- **[23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1409s)** — Health Organization or medical consensus is misinformation and that would be false information.
- **[23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1414s)** — So unfortunately, they're starting to censor anyone who doesn't comply with that. So this
- **[23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1420s)** — is why you may have a hard time finding my videos. So you want to just type Dr. Berg and
- **[23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1425s)** — the topic, because they kind of deranked a lot of us, especially even in the ketogenic
- **[23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1431s)** — world, unfortunately. So I'm going to release a video on that soon. But to me, I think
- **[23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1438s)** — misinformation is incorrect, invalid, false information. I mean, that just would be
- **[24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1445s)** — doesn't mean regardless of how many times is general medical consensus have been wrong.
- **[24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1452s)** — Right. I mean, just recently, they changed their they flipped their idea. And if you
- **[24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1458s)** — take omega three before surgery, because it could thin the blood. So it's constantly changing
- **[24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1463s)** — all that time. So unfortunately, if you have the opposing viewpoint, you're not going to be
- **[24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1470s)** — heard on YouTube. So a lot of people are, are switching to other platforms.
- **[24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1477s)** — Yeah, the idea that the sort of infallible, infallible, you know, medical community
- **[24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1482s)** — sticks with it. Dr. Berg and I both have a great friend, MD in Bethesda, and he graduated from Yale
- **[24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1488s)** — as a doctor. And he said on his graduation day, the Dean said, Congratulations, you've gotten the
- **[24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1494s)** — finest medical education of any place in the world. However, half of what we've taught you
- **[25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1500s)** — is incorrect. And he said, Your job over the next 30 years or so is to figure out which half.
- **[25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1505s)** — So isn't that isn't that, you know, makes you feel comfortable with all that. And it's very
- **[25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1513s)** — true, things change. So, but the medical community will admit themselves that they,
- **[25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1518s)** — they don't know everything and things change constantly. So I'm sorry to hear that other
- **[25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1523s)** — people are speaking on behalf of the medical community. Alright, let's see, let's go back to
- **[25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1530s)** — social media. Raquel from YouTube, could you share any remedies for constant throat clearings?
- **[25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1541s)** — Now, I think it's, I would take the best remedy for that. And this can also cause
- **[25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1547s)** — laryngeal spasm, which will cause coughing as well and a clearing of the throat is to take
- **[25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1552s)** — calcium. Take calcium, I would get the calcium lactate is a good one. But you can take other
- **[25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1558s)** — calcium as well. But that just usually means you need more calcium and that will usually
- **[26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1562s)** — handle that clearing. Now, you could also have acid reflux coming up, that could be a situation,
- **[26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1570s)** — in which case you would use the tain hydrochloride as a remedy. So sometimes you
- **[26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1574s)** — want to differentiate or you might have like some immune infection that is, that's, that
- **[26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1581s)** — you're having this post nasal drip, in which case you would want to take vitamin D, zinc, and
- **[26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1589s)** — also vitamin C. So there you have it. Okay, very good. Stand by, I just pushed the wrong
- **[26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1598s)** — button. Alright, back to social media. Spam Mouse from YouTube, great fellow, which is a
- **[26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1611s)** — I like bell peppers, because you have less sugar, less fructose. But you know,
- **[26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1619s)** — if you have a garden, boy, you should just grow those bell peppers. Oh, I just recently had one
- **[27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1624s)** — of my bell peppers. What a difference between a garden bell pepper and the store bought.
- **[27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1630s)** — I mean, just night and day, when I buy these bell peppers in the store, I'm just like,
- **[27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1634s)** — just nothing to them. Same as like eating a tomato at the store. So I encourage you to
- **[27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1640s)** — either buy them at the farmers market or grow your own. I am going to be starting a channel
- **[27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1646s)** — on growing very soon. I know I've been saying that for some time, but we finally are working
- **[27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1652s)** — on our greenhouse in West Virginia. So we're going to actually film a lot of things
- **[27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1659s)** — related to that. I think it's going to be pretty, pretty exciting, because we're going
- **[27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1662s)** — to do a lot of research and then share what we found in that area, which will
- **[27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1668s)** — help a lot of people who are trying to just decide what the best how to create the best soil and
- **[27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1674s)** — all the other factors that contribute to healthy food. That is excited. We're all waiting for
- **[27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1679s)** — that, Dr. Berg. So great news to hear that it's underway. Okay, let's put up the third
- **[28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1686s)** — quiz question for the day. Then we're going to go over to our green room. And here's the
- **[28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1690s)** — true falser for today. All right, true or false? The average amount of added sugar,
- **[28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1695s)** — a person in the US consumes daily is 26 teaspoons. Sounds like a lot. Is that true
- **[28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1703s)** — or false, audience? Okay, let's we're going to go over to Victoria, who's from Toronto, another
- **[28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1710s)** — area that you're familiar with, Doc. And here she is with her one question, 30 seconds.
- **[28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1716s)** — Hi, Dr. Berg, how are you? Great, thanks. Good, good. I love all of the videos that you
- **[28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1727s)** — post. So thank you. Thank you for all the information that you post. So I wanted to ask
- **[28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1733s)** — a really quick two questions, if I may, I promise I'll get it within 30 seconds. So
- **[28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1738s)** — I have been suffering from endometriosis now for about 20 years. It's a horrible problem in
- **[29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1744s)** — my life. I have two questions about endometriosis and a healthy keto diet with IF. First,
- **[29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1749s)** — on which days of my 25 day cycle should I follow the healthy keto diet, for example,
- **[29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1754s)** — any specific foods that I should avoid during my cycle? And then second is regarding your
- **[29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1759s)** — videos regarding endometriosis and pain relief. Is there a recommended amount of stinging metal
- **[29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1765s)** — root tincture, maybe, if possible, that I should take? And I want to make sure that I
- **[29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1770s)** — don't take too much. Thank you. Yeah, so the cool thing about stinging metal root
- **[29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1774s)** — is it helps to regulate estrogen as well. There's an enzyme called
- **[29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1780s)** — aromatase, which it inhibits. So that can actually help a lot. And I would take,
- **[29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1786s)** — I would take some, right, and then I would keep increasing it until
- **[29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1791s)** — you feel better. And it might be five times the normal amount that you would normally take
- **[29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1796s)** — during when you need it. As far as the foods to avoid with you, unfortunately, dairy is a
- **[30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1809s)** — estrogen more than any other thing. A key trace mineral that you should be focusing on right now
- **[30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1815s)** — is iodine. And c-kelp is a good source. But iodine is one of those wonderful things that can
- **[30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1820s)** — actually help balance this estrogen problem and reduce the formation even of endometriosis.
- **[30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1830s)** — There is some additional data that I recently stumbled on that you could probably do further
- **[30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1839s)** — research on something called natokinase. It's an enzyme to help dissolve fibrous tissue.
- **[30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1847s)** — And that's what endometriosis is. So you might want to see if there's any connection between
- **[30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1855s)** — natokinase and endometriosis. You might find something there.
- **[31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1860s)** — Thank you. Thank you. The c-kelp, because I ordered all of your supplements, by the way.
- **[31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1864s)** — So your c-kelp, does it have iodine? Because I don't remember.
- **[31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1868s)** — Yeah, yeah, it has iodine in the right amount. So yeah, you're good on that for sure.
- **[31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1872s)** — Perfect. Thank you.
- **[31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1874s)** — You're welcome.
- **[31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1875s)** — Great question. Thank you so much, Victoria. And can't wait to hear,
- **[31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1880s)** — you know, fair weather times for you in the future with your continued pursuit of getting
- **[31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1886s)** — some relief from that irritating and troubling disease, if that's what it's called. Okay,
- **[31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1893s)** — let's go and ask a question from Lou from YouTube. I've been suffering from migraines.
- **[31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1899s)** — I suspect it's from high histamine levels because of my eczema and insomnia. What's the
- **[31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1909s)** — part of his problem? Corsetin is one remedy. And a lot more vitamin C
- **[31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1917s)** — can help reduce histamine levels too. And there's also, you might want to do a search on
- **[32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1923s)** — high histamine foods and start avoiding those as well. And there's quite a list on that.
- **[32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1929s)** — But the biggest thing is the corsetin is a good remedy for that and in higher amounts.
- **[32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1936s)** — So try that. Onions actually are loaded with corsetin. So start eating a lot of onions as well.
- **[32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1944s)** — Very good. Good luck with that. Okay, quiz question number three was a true-false, sir.
- **[32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1949s)** — And it asks true-false. The average amount of added sugar a person in the U.S. consumes
- **[32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1954s)** — daily is 26 teaspoons. That's a pile, I believe. And 72% of our respondents say it's true,
- **[32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1962s)** — 28% say that's just impossible. No way. It's true. It's true. Now that doesn't even
- **[32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1969s)** — count for the amount of sugar that's in the other carbohydrates, like all the breads,
- **[32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1975s)** — pasta, cereal, crackers, that type of thing. So you have to realize that an average American,
- **[32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1979s)** — I mean, who's average? There's quite a few people that are eating way more than that.
- **[33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1984s)** — And there's a lot of people eating a lot less than that, including myself. So
- **[33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1992s)** — unfortunately, that's going to create something called hyperglycemia. Now,
- **[33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=1999s)** — this is interesting. If you look at a trusted source of medical to learn about hyperglycemia
- **[33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2006s)** — from, of course, Wikipedia, we know they're the most trusted source. If you look down to
- **[33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2011s)** — the cause of that, it doesn't even mention dietary sugar at all. I wonder how that got
- **[33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2017s)** — omitted. I mean, that just blew my mind. So, you know, it could come from glandular endocrine
- **[33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2023s)** — problems or diabetes or, or infection or excess eating, but no one didn't mention this excess
- **[33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2031s)** — sugar in the diet. It's kind of like the elephant in the room. And
- **[33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2038s)** — apparently that's an omission. Yeah. Okay. And here's evidence of someone that probably
- **[34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2043s)** — doesn't do that anymore. Jack from Facebook, I've lost 50 pounds on healthy keto and intermittent
- **[34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2048s)** — fasting. Thank you, Dr. Berg with several exclamation marks. So good for you, Jack.
- **[34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2054s)** — That's a tremendous achievement. And I know you feel terrific. So, and there's lots of
- **[34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2059s)** — those again, audience, we could spend most part of the show, recanting people's pleasure
- **[34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2066s)** — from feeling better and being healthier. But we want to stick with your questions as the
- **[34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2071s)** — paramount thing so we can get you feeling healthier and better. Let's see.
- **[34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2079s)** — How about Rebecca from Facebook, what would you take to alleviate shaky hands?
- **[34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2086s)** — And what do you recommend to address varicose veins?
- **[34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2093s)** — Well, I mean, there are people that have a dopamine deficiency and Parkinson's,
- **[35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2100s)** — Parkinson's that shake their hands a lot. And I don't, that's more rare. So I wouldn't
- **[35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2106s)** — go in that direction. I will say that there's some interesting data about a vitamin B1
- **[35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2112s)** — deficiency and that affecting part of the brain that controls this involuntary movement.
- **[35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2120s)** — So I might, I would recommend taking a natural source of B1, but take larger amounts. That
- **[35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2129s)** — would go right to that whole lemon that's loaded with the bioflavonoids that can help
- **[35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2135s)** — support this, the vein collagen outer part of that vein and artery. And that would help
- **[35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2143s)** — your circulation as well. Also realize that if you have estrogen dominance,
- **[35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2150s)** — that can also cause increase in varicose veins and spider veins. So you might want to deal
- **[35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2157s)** — with that as well with iodine or the cruciferous vegetables, which help balance out that excess
- **[36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2163s)** — estrogen. Okay, I think this is an interesting question. Boika from Facebook,
- **[36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2168s)** — is it okay to consume colostrum during intermittent fasting?
- **[36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2174s)** — Good question. I think it's okay. It's not not too much of a dose. And there is some
- **[36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2181s)** — small amount of calories in there. If you can find colostrum from a sheep or a goat
- **[36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2186s)** — versus a cow, you might it might work a little bit better. But I'm not saying the cows
- **[36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2192s)** — won't work. But I know some people there have sensitivities to casein,
- **[36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2198s)** — and even lactose, which could be in that colostrum. But colostrum has like,
- **[36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2203s)** — all these amazing immune factors. And if we just talk about colostrum, we talk to talk
- **[36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2209s)** — breast milk, which is the most amazing liquid gold nutrition that a human or baby could consume.
- **[36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2219s)** — And unfortunately, the baby infant formulas, the companies are really discouraging,
- **[37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2227s)** — in indirect ways, women breastfeeding. And I think if you take a look at some of these
- **[37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2233s)** — formulas, they're like at the epitome of ultra processed junk food. I mean, look at the
- **[37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2239s)** — ingredients in this stuff. I would not want to give that to an infant. If you can't breastfeed,
- **[37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2246s)** — there's something called a Loleche League, you could get some donations from breast milk. But
- **[37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2250s)** — the colostrum is really important for the immune system. And even if you have like,
- **[37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2255s)** — if you had to take a lot of steroids, or, and you damage your immune system, colostrum
- **[37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2260s)** — is one way to kind of help recover it. So I talked about that in a video. So
- **[37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2264s)** — can you describe for the audience what colostrum is? Is it different from breast milk in itself?
- **[37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2270s)** — It's the thing that's produced in the first time, first few times that you
- **[37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2278s)** — give milk when you're breastfeeding, there's a colostrum that's released. And that has a
- **[38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2285s)** — tremendous amount of immune building properties. And it's called the part of the innate immune
- **[38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2293s)** — system. Not something, not the other system that you acquire from being infected, but
- **[38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2299s)** — something that the mother gives you. And the other thing in breast milk, and I don't know
- **[38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2304s)** — about colostrum, is you have a lot of probiotics as well from the mother to the infant.
- **[38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2310s)** — So you get a lot of great things from colostrum, but mainly immune factors that are in the first
- **[38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2317s)** — part of that cycle of breastfeeding. Okay, very good. Let's see. Kelly from YouTube,
- **[38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2325s)** — I need your help to quit smoking. That's a rotten thing. Please share your suggestions.
- **[38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2332s)** — I think smoking tends to help people reduce stress. They drink, they smoke to
- **[38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2339s)** — relax, reduce stress. So if you were to take some type of natural combination of things,
- **[39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2347s)** — like let's say ashwagandha, natural vitamin B1, and lemon balm tea, and you just
- **[39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2353s)** — started adding that as a replacement, that might help you. And if it's really bad,
- **[39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2358s)** — maybe you need to add like a whole desiccated adrenal supplement with that. But there's going
- **[39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2363s)** — to be a couple weeks of withdrawals and difficulty coming off cigarettes or nicotine.
- **[39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2371s)** — But that's what I would recommend, because it's definitely all the chemicals and the actual smoke
- **[39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2380s)** — and the carbon monoxide, the arsenic, all that stuff ends up right through your lung
- **[39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2386s)** — into your bloodstream, into the arteries. And it messes with your arteries and it creates
- **[39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2392s)** — problems that you don't want. So
- **[39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2397s)** — it also kind of increases your risk for cancer and other issues too. So it's best that you take
- **[40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2403s)** — this and substitute that stress relief with other things that can reduce stress. Keep
- **[40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2412s)** — yourself really busy as well. Yeah, Kelly, I tell you, and all those people in the audience,
- **[40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2416s)** — and there's millions still that are smoking, that was one of the most difficult but rewarding
- **[40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2420s)** — things that I ever did. I quit about 35 years ago. And when I asked a few people nervously while
- **[40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2426s)** — I was 15 minutes into quitting smoking, you know, how do you do it? And many people would
- **[40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2431s)** — say, well, you know, you have the physical part for three days, and then the emotional part
- **[40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2436s)** — for five days, and then you're fine. And I thought, that doesn't sound right. And I finally
- **[40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2440s)** — talked to one guy and he said, Look, just forget about the calendar. He goes, it's going
- **[40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2444s)** — to suck for a while, but it's well worth it. So just don't look day by day, just just
- **[40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2450s)** — stating it's okay to want a cigarette and it's okay not to smoke one and just keep with that.
- **[40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2455s)** — And I'm so glad I did. But that is an insane addiction. I mean, it's hard to describe people
- **[41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2462s)** — that haven't been, but it is just bugs you every second. And so I'm so grateful. I'm
- **[41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2468s)** — free of that. And Kelly, you can be too. So why don't you check back in with us?
- **[41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2472s)** — And one last thing, I bought a bicycle for the first time in my life, right when I quit
- **[41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2477s)** — smoking, because I said, I don't think I can smoke a cigarette while I'm riding.
- **[41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2480s)** — And then every time I thought, Well, why don't you start smoking? Okay, good. I'll just bend
- **[41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2484s)** — up the bicycle. I won't be needing that anymore. And that that little routine kept me off long
- **[41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2489s)** — enough. And I still enjoy riding bikes. So good for you, Kelly, keep it up.
- **[41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2495s)** — All right, let's see. Lynn from Facebook, what would you recommend for someone diagnosed
- **[41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2501s)** — with S. Jogren syndrome, a long term autoimmune disease that affects the body's moisture
- **[41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2509s)** — producing glands? That's interesting. You heard of that? Oh, okay. Vitamin D in high
- **[41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2517s)** — quantities, anything with autoimmune, you want to take vitamin D, and I'm talking like maybe
- **[42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2522s)** — 40 to 50,000 I use per day. That would be a good thing to take. There is some other types
- **[42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2530s)** — of remedies to help lubricate the eyes in the meantime, and you can get those online,
- **[42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2537s)** — they're natural remedies. But yeah, this, the tear glands and start drying up and you have
- **[42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2544s)** — all sorts of issues with even your connective tissue and your skin. So high levels of vitamin
- **[42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2550s)** — D tend to act as like a natural steroid without the side effect. You know, we think about
- **[42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2558s)** — vitamin D as a vitamin, but really, it's a hormone. And it has very similar functions
- **[42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2564s)** — to cortisol. But it does, it's like an anti inflammatory, and it helps your immune system.
- **[42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2571s)** — But cortisol suppresses the immune system. Vitamin D regulates or moderates
- **[42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2579s)** — the immune system. So it won't, it'll turn off like a cytokine storm, but it will,
- **[43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2584s)** — it will not shut it down like cortisol will. Interesting. Okay, I'm going to use the same
- **[43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2589s)** — routine we did a few minutes ago. And that is to ask a question. And then we're going to go
- **[43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2593s)** — to our final green room participant, Joyce. So Joyce, stand by for a minute. And here's
- **[43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2599s)** — quiz question number four. All right, most of your vitamin E is stored in which body organ?
- **[43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2610s)** — All right, well, Joyce, boom, we replace the question and bring you up. One question,
- **[43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2615s)** — please, in 30 seconds. Good morning, Dr. Berg, thank you for all the information that you share
- **[43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2621s)** — with everybody. I love your program. The question I have today is about my husband.
- **[43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2628s)** — About a year ago, he was diagnosed with slow AFib. So only when he's relaxed as he go into
- **[43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2635s)** — a atrial AFib. He also he takes meds for high blood pressure. He has psoriatic arthritis,
- **[44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2645s)** — which he no longer takes biologics for because keto and IF has helped that tremendously.
- **[44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2652s)** — And my question is, what can we do? Well, actually, he had a cardioversion too. I forgot
- **[44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2658s)** — in March he had a cardioversion which lasted three days. What else can we do to help this
- **[44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2667s)** — situation? The doctors are saying, you know, blood thinners for the rest of your life. We
- **[44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2672s)** — live a very active lifestyle and you know, he exercises and it's just a little unsettling.
- **[44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2681s)** — So yeah, just so you know, like, I'm just going to give you areas of research because,
- **[44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2684s)** — of course, I can't. I'm not going to cure anything. But here's some things to look at.
- **[44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2689s)** — Number one, you said he was he he is or he was an athlete at one time, right?
- **[44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2694s)** — Yeah. Did he did he do biking? No, not so much. He played lacrosse, running, surfing.
- **[45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2704s)** — Yeah, we used to be big runners, but not so much anymore. Because because one of the things
- **[45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2709s)** — that can happen if someone was an athlete is their heart becomes stronger and bigger.
- **[45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2715s)** — And when the heart becomes bigger, it does alter the pacemakers. You have four of them.
- **[45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2721s)** — And that that can that can create a rhythmia just from the heart being bigger. So that's
- **[45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2728s)** — just one as a side note, because I did a lot of biking. And I started having arrhythmias.
- **[45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2734s)** — What's going on? So there's a couple of things. And of course, the elephant in the room is
- **[45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2742s)** — electrolytes. Definitely the magnesium and potassium. And larger amounts over a longer
- **[45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2747s)** — period of time will be necessary to really build up the body. I think a really good test
- **[45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2753s)** — if you could find do a search on the internet. It's called interest. It's called
- **[45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2759s)** — interest cellular magnesium test. So you want to check not in your blood, but inside the cells.
- **[46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2767s)** — And you send you a kit and you take a little scrape of the inside of your
- **[46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2772s)** — your mouth. You send it in and it'll tell you where your interest cellular potassium is.
- **[46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2776s)** — I'm sorry, magnesium. I think they might check potassium too. But that would be a
- **[46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2781s)** — really good test to see what's going on with that mineral. Because I know the
- **[46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2787s)** — electrolytes are involved in arrhythmias problems. You also have electromagnetic fields from cell
- **[46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2797s)** — phones. And like I found, if you get a tester, I don't think I have mine here, but a trifield
- **[46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2806s)** — EMF tester, go around your house. And I found not only my computer, but right in the head of
- **[46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2815s)** — wall where I sleep was radiating magnetic fields eight feet off the wall. So every time I went to
- **[47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2822s)** — sleep, I was bathing in this electromagnetic field. I had an electrician open the wall,
- **[47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2829s)** — looking in there, they found all these cross wires and all these problems electrically that
- **[47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2833s)** — they fixed all that. And my arrhythmias went away. That was my the cause of mine.
- **[47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2839s)** — Okay, so you have that. And then the other things with arrhythmias, if you take a look at
- **[47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2847s)** — if the body is too astra to alkaline, you can have arrhythmias on both spectrum. So it's just
- **[47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2853s)** — something else to look at in relationship to arrhythmias. Worst case scenario, if he has
- **[47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2859s)** — to take a blood thinner, I would I would try to find one that is doesn't restrict his ability
- **[47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2866s)** — to consume dark leafy green, vitamin K rich vegetables. I know they have them out there.
- **[47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2874s)** — Because the Coumatin doesn't allow you to do that. So that restricts certain things. So
- **[48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2882s)** — I'm not sure if the one that he's on he I don't know if I can say the name of it. But
- **[48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2886s)** — so relto if that restricts I don't remember the doctor saying that you he couldn't have
- **[48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2892s)** — leafy greens. I'm not sure. But okay, something to look at. But those are the things that I
- **[48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2899s)** — would recommend. And hopefully one of those will help him. Thank you so much. You're
- **[48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2907s)** — welcome. That's great, Joyce. You know, keep us posted on your husband's progress, we hope. So
- **[48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2915s)** — get back to the bicycle or whatever. I guess he didn't do that. Get back to his active life.
- **[48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2920s)** — Would be terrific. Okay, so let's see. We did get answers in the interim while Joyce was
- **[48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2927s)** — giving us her husband's condition. And the question asked most of your vitamin E is stored
- **[48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2932s)** — in which body organ and 55% of the respondents say it's the skin 35% say it's the liver and
- **[49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2942s)** — stuck in the brain. Okay, the answer is adipose tissue. It's your fat. Your fat is an organ that
- **[49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2953s)** — produces hormones, but your fat stores the majority of your vitamin E, but not just vitamin
- **[49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2960s)** — A, vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K. And so when you lose weight, when you do a fast,
- **[49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2970s)** — for example, you have to realize you're releasing some of these fat soluble vitamins
- **[49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2975s)** — into circulation. And this allows you to not be deficient. So think about an overweight person
- **[49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2983s)** — that can't tap into fat. They can't tap into some of these fat soluble vitamins as well.
- **[49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2990s)** — But what's interesting about this is that when you consume water soluble vitamins,
- **[49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=2995s)** — like the B vitamins and vitamin C, the question is, how long are these water soluble
- **[50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3003s)** — vitamins stored in the body? And for that question, I should probably ask that next weekend,
- **[50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3009s)** — or next week, because it's a really good question with a very interesting answer.
- **[50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3013s)** — Interesting. Well, we can't wait for that. And speaking of questions, here's the final one
- **[50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3017s)** — for this show. Okay, what is the advantage of consuming fermented foods over just fiber
- **[50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3024s)** — rich foods? Climb on it audience. Okay, Anila from Facebook, the root cause of most diseases
- **[50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3031s)** — inflammation. What steps should we follow every day to change that condition?
- **[50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3037s)** — I think inflammation is not the root cause. It's the tip of the iceberg. There's something
- **[50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3043s)** — deeper. What's causing the inflammation, you got to pull the string deeper. And that's usually
- **[50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3048s)** — related to this thing called diet. So there's something that a person's eating that's
- **[50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3054s)** — creating inflammation. The most likely reason is the sugar and refined carbs, refined sugars and
- **[51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lp4My1qcVo&t=3062s)** — refined carbs. Then we get the omega-6 fatty acid type oils, the seed oils. So we're
