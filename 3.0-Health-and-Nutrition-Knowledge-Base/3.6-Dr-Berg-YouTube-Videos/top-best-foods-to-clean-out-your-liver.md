- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the best foods to clean out your liver. Or shall we say just make the liver cleaner.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=6s)** — Because many of us don't realize that the liver is not like a sponge that holds toxins.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=13s)** — It's an organ that detoxifies, it removes toxins, unless you have a fatty liver.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=19s)** — So three different problems with the liver. You can have a fatty liver, you can have an inflamed
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=23s)** — liver or a combination, and then that inflammation creates scar tissue. And then you
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=28s)** — develop cirrhosis. So the question is like what type of foods could you eat to make the liver
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=34s)** — healthier and cleaner? Let me just first briefly touch on what the liver does.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=40s)** — I'm not going to go through all 500 functions, but it does a lot. It actually turns ammonia
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=47s)** — into urea. So if there's a problem with the liver, you get this backup of ammonia. And you
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=52s)** — can even actually smell it on someone's breath. Sometimes when you go to like a nursing home,
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=57s)** — it smells like ammonia. That is what's happening. Liver damage, it's backing up,
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=62s)** — it can go into the brain and create a lot of toxicity. So that's one thing it does. It
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=67s)** — helps detoxify ammonia, which comes from certain protein metabolism breakdown. Then we
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=72s)** — get the next one, the buffering of hormones. There's certain things in the liver that help
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=77s)** — buffer hormones. So if they're too much or they're too little, the body will regulate
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=83s)** — the amount of active form of a certain hormone based on the needs, especially estrogen,
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=90s)** — cortisol, and even testosterone. So for example, if you have cirrhosis of the liver,
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=96s)** — you can get a massive buildup of estrogen. And if you're male and you're older and you
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=102s)** — have cirrhosis of the liver, your skin becomes very, very smooth. You lose body hair,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=108s)** — you might get man boobs, creating all sorts of estrogenic effects.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=111s)** — Your cortisol can go up, you can be stressed because there's something in your liver that
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=116s)** — helps buffer cortisol. And because estrogen goes higher, you become lower with testosterone.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=122s)** — So there goes your muscles, there goes your get up and go, there goes your libido. Okay,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=127s)** — T4, that is the inactive form of the thyroid hormone. Did you realize that 80%
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=133s)** — of the activation of the thyroid hormone into this active T3 happens through your liver? So
- **[02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=139s)** — from T4 to T3. So we need a healthy liver to make that conversion. If that doesn't happen,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=145s)** — you start developing hypothyroidism. Growth hormone, which is the anti-aging hormone,
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=151s)** — it has everything to do with proteins, building proteins, helping you sleep at night,
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=157s)** — longevity. That hormone works with the liver as well. And there's kind of like an
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=162s)** — extension of growth hormone. It's called IGF1, which does similar functions, if not
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=167s)** — identical functions of the growth hormone. So if there's a problem with the liver,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=171s)** — growth hormone doesn't seem to work that well. Then we have vitamin D. Vitamin D is
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=176s)** — activated by the liver and the kidney. So without a good liver function, you don't get
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=182s)** — the benefit of the active form of vitamin D. And even when they check the blood, they always
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=186s)** — check the inactive form. They don't check the active form of vitamin D. They're checking the
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=192s)** — inactive form, assuming that it's being converted. But what if the liver and the kidneys are
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=198s)** — damaged? Okay, you're not going to be able to get a true picture of what's going on with
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=202s)** — vitamin D if you're just measuring the inactive form of vitamin D. But one of the
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=207s)** — main functions of the liver is to detoxify toxins and poisons to harmless water soluble
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=213s)** — particles. So whether that's pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, heavy metals,
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=218s)** — or even toxins from cigarettes or alcohol or processed foods, your body tends to break that
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=224s)** — down. If this liver function doesn't work, you get a backup of toxicity. There's also a
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=230s)** — function of producing bile to help you extract the fat soluble nutrients from the food,
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=235s)** — including omega-3, vitamin A, D, E, and K. So without this, you're going to have all sorts of
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=241s)** — problems with nutrients and being able to create an anti-inflammatory effect because the
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=246s)** — omega-3 just can't go into the body, can't work. Next one is glycogen. That's stored glucose in
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=252s)** — your liver. So the liver holds glycogen to allow you to run off that fuel between meals.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=261s)** — And so let's say, for example, your liver is fatty or it's dysfunctional, you have cirrhosis,
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=265s)** — and you can't run off glycogen between meals. You're going to have issues with your brain
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=270s)** — because your brain doesn't store glycogen. It depends on the liver glycogen or whatever you
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=275s)** — eat for its fuel, unless you're on the ketogenic diet, in which you're going to live off the
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=279s)** — ketones that are going to generate it. But a lot of these ketones are generated from the liver.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=284s)** — So again, we're going to have a problem with fuel if the liver is damaged, especially for
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=289s)** — your brain and other cells. Immune function. Until recently, I did not know of the
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=298s)** — magnitude of how important the liver is for your immune system. You have specialized immune
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=303s)** — cells in the liver. You have a lot of different lymphatic sinuses in the liver that help you
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=309s)** — from all sorts of different angles for the immune system. And so the more we lose the liver
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=314s)** — function, the more we lose the immune function. There are some really key things you want to
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=319s)** — avoid first, because you can eat a lot of healthy foods. But if you're eating these at
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=324s)** — the same time, the liver is just not going to work that well. And I'm not going to get into
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=329s)** — the obvious stuff like alcohol, like regular sugar, things like that. I want to get into
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=334s)** — some hidden things that you need to be aware of. Number one, soy protein isolates. Okay,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=339s)** — that's in a lot of different foods. Now, if you do research on this, probably the first five
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=343s)** — pages in Google, you'll see that it's all healthy for the liver. It's totally fine. I
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=347s)** — don't buy that because I've had people when I was in practice come in and be on a certain
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=353s)** — diet for a bit of time. And in that diet, it was a weight loss diet. And one of the diets was
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=359s)** — called ideal protein. There's many others, but there are a lot of weight loss programs that have
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=363s)** — this as their main protein. It's low fat, highly refined protein in soy. And the way they
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=371s)** — process it, there's nothing that's going to resemble the actual soybean itself. So anyway,
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=376s)** — here's what I've noticed after someone being on this diet, being exposed to soy protein
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=381s)** — isolates for a period of time, I noticed that a common denominator is their liver. They have a
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=387s)** — lot of liver issues, like gallbladder issues, right lower abdomen heaviness and pain. And some
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=395s)** — people had to go to the doctor and have their gallbladders removed. So I can't buy
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=400s)** — that something that process can be good for the liver because the liver thrives on things
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=406s)** — like whole foods, not refined foods. So I would read the ingredients and avoid soy protein
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=413s)** — isolates. Soy protein meal might be good for animals, especially if they take out the fats
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=419s)** — out of it so it doesn't turn rancid. But for humans, I don't think it's the best protein.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=423s)** — The next thing is seed oils, highly processed and is processed with hexane,
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=428s)** — which is a solvent. But that exposure of this highly refined fat, omega-6 fatty acid.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=436s)** — Yes, we have oxidative stress, we have inflammation, but I think also it's replacing
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=440s)** — ourselves. It's going deep into the tissue. It's not a natural thing, but we consume so much
- **[07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=446s)** — of it. All right, the next food I would definitely avoid. And you probably already
- **[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=450s)** — know this high fructose corn syrup. But what you probably didn't know, they're not starting
- **[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=454s)** — out making this high fructose corn syrup with this sweet corn that people eat during
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=459s)** — the summer, right? They don't start out with that. They use what's called dent corn or field
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=464s)** — corn. It's completely inedible. I don't care how much butter you put on that corn or you
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=471s)** — add salt. It's disgusting. And the majority of corn grown is this field corn to fatten cattle,
- **[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=478s)** — right? To make the meat marbly. What is it doing to us? And they also use it for
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=484s)** — high fructose corn syrup and glucose syrup and the modified starches. And so they start
- **[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=492s)** — with this inedible corn, okay, and they go through probably like 18 different steps. I don't
- **[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=498s)** — even know the exact number, but it's a lot of different steps. And they're taking the protein
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=502s)** — out and they're breaking it down with enzymes and acids. And then they add this chemical
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=506s)** — to it and that chemical and they use high heats. At the end of this chain of event,
- **[08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=510s)** — you get something that does not resemble anything related to corn. And we're putting
- **[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=515s)** — this in our body. And it's been in the food supply since I think 1977, when farmers were
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=522s)** — paid or subsidized because of the corn. But the problem, it's so heavy in this
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=526s)** — alter processed foods, aka junk foods and flavored and sweetened in a way that makes it
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=535s)** — taste somewhat good, but highly addictive. And high fructose corn syrup has some very
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=539s)** — unique properties in that the majority of it is processed by the liver. Okay, not all,
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=543s)** — but the majority. So the liver takes the beating. It creates inflammation. It leads to
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=549s)** — insulin resistance. It leads to problems with your blood fats and cholesterol. It leads to
- **[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=555s)** — problems with the fatty liver. It stimulates more hunger. The high fructose corn syrup is
- **[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=560s)** — very, very different than the fructose from fruit. And it's just ultra refined. Okay, so
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=566s)** — that's one I would definitely stay away from. Then we get to refined starches. I'm talking
- **[09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=570s)** — about maltodextrin. I'm talking about modified food starch. And like, for example, like in
- **[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=577s)** — this food right here, we have corn starch, corn syrup, dextrose, all made out of corn. Okay,
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=585s)** — so that's what this is made out of. So you're feeding kids and some adults, I don't even call
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=591s)** — it food, because it doesn't fit the definition of food. Food is something that gives you fuel
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=595s)** — and help nourish the body. Well, this fuel will not give you energy. It'll make you so
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=600s)** — tired. And the only nutrients in there are the synthetics that they spray in there,
- **[10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=605s)** — but they're all made from, you know, chemicals and things like that. And then we get glucose
- **[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=609s)** — syrup itself. Now, what's interesting, there's no sugar in here from sugar cane. Okay,
- **[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=616s)** — we replace sugar cane, which even I think growing up back in the early 70s, we use a lot of
- **[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=623s)** — sugar cane and a lot of sodas and things like that. That's all been replaced with this
- **[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=627s)** — synthetic or highly synthesized sugar, which I think behaves a lot differently than even
- **[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=634s)** — sugar cane. And so it's all day coincidence, right, with this ultra processed food, which is
- **[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=639s)** — mainly highly refined corn and other starch products with the GMO on top of that. And if
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=646s)** — you look at liver function, I think ultra processed foods, which what I just described
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=650s)** — is probably at the very top of the list as far as destroying your liver. So the question is,
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=655s)** — what can you eat to keep liver healthy? Okay, you want to eat whole foods. Let's first talk
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=660s)** — about fats. Okay, some of the best fats would be like olive oil. Okay, but also a different
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=667s)** — type of fat called medium chain triglycerides, MCT oil type fats, and that would be in butter.
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=674s)** — So you'd want to cook with butter, put butter in your food, but make sure it's from grass fed,
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=679s)** — you know, cow milk. But the MCT fats, the medium chain triglycerides are very different
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=685s)** — because they don't require bile. So they're less stressful on the liver when you consume them.
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=693s)** — I also found some research that these MCT oils or fats help protect against a fatty liver.
- **[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=700s)** — You want to make sure you cook with it. And then on your salad, you put olive oil,
- **[11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=703s)** — extra virgin, high quality olive oil. Don't use the seed oils. Make your own salad dressing.
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=709s)** — Very important if you want to help your liver. Number two, fish. Okay, wild caught fish,
- **[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=715s)** — preferably high in omega-3 fatty acids, because omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory.
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=721s)** — They're liver protective. They help balance the cholesterol issues. All right, number three,
- **[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=727s)** — organic pasture raised eggs, not commercial eggs. But egg yolks have probably the highest
- **[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=733s)** — amount of choline of any food that I know. I'm not sure about liver. Liver might have
- **[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=738s)** — more choline, but egg yolks have a lot of choline. Choline is great for a fatty liver.
- **[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=743s)** — If you're deficient in choline, you can end up with a fatty liver. But choline helps remove fat
- **[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=748s)** — off your liver. Not to mention the high quality protein in eggs, as well as all the other
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=754s)** — nutrients. The next food on the list is a general category of dark leafy green vegetables,
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=758s)** — or just leafy green vegetables. Why? Because of the vitamin C, because of the folate,
- **[12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=765s)** — which is very important to the liver, because of the magnesium, the potassium,
- **[12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=772s)** — and the phytonutrients. There are so many great properties, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory
- **[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=777s)** — properties that are really good for the liver. Now, the only time I wouldn't recommend them,
- **[13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=781s)** — if you had some type of inflammatory gut issue, which you can't deal with the fiber. But for
- **[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=786s)** — everyone else, I would recommend that. Number five is a type of vegetable. It's a category
- **[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=790s)** — of vegetables. It's cruciferous. Out of all the cruciferous, radish is probably the
- **[13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=795s)** — best thing for the liver. Unfortunately, I just can't eat radishes. I don't like them.
- **[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=798s)** — I know my wife likes them. She just can eat them like candy. I can't consume them. But
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=803s)** — if I did like them, I would eat a lot of them. Radishes have this higher sulfur compound
- **[13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=808s)** — that is really good for the phase one, phase two detoxification. So we talked about this
- **[13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=815s)** — poison turning into water soluble things. Well, this enzyme complex takes this poison from
- **[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=823s)** — very toxic and starts to break it down. And when you consume cruciferous vegetables and other
- **[13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=830s)** — herbs, there are certain things in them that activate our own phase one, phase two detoxifying
- **[13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=838s)** — enzymes, as well as give us enzymes to help break down these chemicals. So this is why
- **[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=845s)** — we recommend cruciferous. So radishes are good. Second favorite is arugula. It's a little
- **[14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=850s)** — bitter. Anything bitter is good for the liver. And of course, we get brussels sprouts,
- **[14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=855s)** — cabbage, really good for the lower bowel, which support the liver as well. There's this whole
- **[14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=863s)** — connection between your bowel or your friendly bacteria and your liver. If one goes down,
- **[14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=868s)** — the other one goes down. So cabbage is good for anything inflamed in your gut and even in
- **[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=874s)** — the liver. There's other cruciferous vegetables, but those are the four that I like the most.
- **[14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=878s)** — Number six category, probiotic foods. I just mentioned this, the friendly flora greatly
- **[14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=884s)** — supports the liver. If you were exposed to an antibiotic or something to destroy your good
- **[14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=891s)** — flora, the liver suffers. If you're exposed to something like aspartame or some other synthetic
- **[14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=897s)** — artificial sweetener, that alters the gut microbiome, which then raises liver enzymes
- **[15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=905s)** — and puts you at risk for a fatty liver. So the three top foods for that that I like,
- **[15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=909s)** — sauerkraut, make sure you get it raw, kimchi, same thing. And then we have kefir, make sure
- **[15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=915s)** — that it's organic kefir, unsweetened. If you can get goat kefir or sheep kefir, that's even
- **[15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=920s)** — better. Kefir is better than yogurt because it has strains of friendly yeast and friendly
- **[15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=925s)** — bacteria. It has a lot more than just the yogurt. And the last category is grass-fed meat
- **[15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=930s)** — in different forms. You can do lamb, you can do goat, you can do beef, deer meat. I would just
- **[15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=937s)** — make sure that it's grass-fed, grass-finished. That would be the ideal situation if you can. If
- **[15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=942s)** — you can't, well, then get what you can. But I will tell you from personal experience, when I
- **[15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=946s)** — consume high quality meat, my liver feels great. It feels good compared to me eating
- **[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=955s)** — peanut butter or nuts or seeds. I have some experience with liver problems. I destroyed my
- **[16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=962s)** — liver from eating ultra processed foods and a lot of bad foods for many years. In fact,
- **[16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=966s)** — there was one year I remember I consumed every night margaritas, just every single night,
- **[16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=973s)** — and they were sweetened. And at first it was great, right? But then towards the end of the
- **[16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=977s)** — year, boy, my health started going down, down, down, down. And of course, then I
- **[16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=985s)** — went to a sugar coma to help myself sleep. And to perceive both of these actions,
- **[16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=990s)** — I lived on junk food for years, never ate anything raw or healthy. Everything was refined,
- **[16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=996s)** — lots of pasta, lots of bread, lots of refined carbohydrates, lots of cereal,
- **[16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1002s)** — and a lot of Doritos and chips. Until I eventually started noticing a heavy,
- **[16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1007s)** — full feeling underneath my right rib cage that little did I know it was my gallbladder,
- **[16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1012s)** — which is connected to the liver. And then it started referring pain to my right shoulder,
- **[16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1017s)** — which I've had this pain for years, like at least 12 to 15 years. I didn't know what it
- **[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1023s)** — was at the time. And of course, I had a lot of bloating and indigestion and I didn't connect
- **[17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1028s)** — the dots. And it wasn't until I started getting rid of these grains and getting rid of the
- **[17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1032s)** — cereal and replacing it with meat that I started nursing relief. And so I started
- **[17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1038s)** — noticing, wow, that that sensation is going away. So it actually helped my blood sugar,
- **[17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1044s)** — it helped my brain fog, but it took the inflammation away from my liver. Sometimes you
- **[17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1049s)** — hear that meat is bad for you, but they're not differentiating grass fed grass finished
- **[17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1055s)** — beef and processed meat. They put them all in one big category with junk food. Now let's
- **[17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1061s)** — compare that with the fake meat products, right? You have soy protein isolates, you have
- **[17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1067s)** — modified food starch, you have potato starch in there, maybe pea protein, maybe rice syrup,
- **[17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1075s)** — solids, things like that. I mean, think about when you eat that, what you're going to feel
- **[17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1078s)** — like. I was at Whole Foods a long time ago and I was at the deli and I was really hungry.
- **[18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1084s)** — So I said, wow, those those chicken wings look pretty darn good, right? So I bought some
- **[18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1089s)** — chicken wings. They looked all the same size and shape, but I didn't question it. I just
- **[18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1094s)** — said, oh, okay, so there must be just some chicken meat, you know, that's maybe formed into one.
- **[18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1100s)** — Little did I know that was the soy protein isolate fake meat with probably the textured
- **[18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1105s)** — vegetable protein, whatever. Anyway, I was eating it on the way home. I thought, wow,
- **[18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1110s)** — this is just tastes pretty good until I got home. And then I got really, really sick,
- **[18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1117s)** — bloated. My eyes started feeling irritated. Not good. And there's two last supplements. I think
- **[18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1124s)** — I'm going to recommend just if you have like cirrhosis of the liver, because the problem
- **[18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1128s)** — with cirrhosis is that a lot of times people are on the liver transplant list and there's a
- **[18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1134s)** — long waiting list. But why don't we just maybe try to revive the liver and to try to
- **[19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1140s)** — reverse this damage if we can in the meantime. So tokatrinols, it's a type of vitamin E,
- **[19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1146s)** — really good for everything liver. The next thing is called tutka. Tutka is a type of bile salt
- **[19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1152s)** — that really keeps the liver healthy and keeps the sludge from building up in the liver.
- **[19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1158s)** — And you'll feel much better if you take that. I would take two in the morning,
- **[19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1162s)** — okay, empty stomach, take two in the afternoon, empty stomach. I'm not going to recommend any
- **[19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1168s)** — brands. You just have to just search that out and look at various products and their reviews to
- **[19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1174s)** — see if you could find a good one. So those are the two supplements. Now, if you have not seen
- **[19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1178s)** — my video on how to diagnose your liver by using your foot, it sounds kind of funny,
- **[19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT_1LXlJqM&t=1184s)** — but it's really interesting information. I put that video up right here. Check it out.
