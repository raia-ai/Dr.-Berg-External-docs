- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=0s)** — Today I'm going to give you 11 really bizarre wild vitamin D deficiency symptoms.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=6s)** — Now, of course, most people know the usual vitamin D symptoms.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=9s)** — Lower back pain, depression, high blood pressure, inflammation, autoimmune diseases, things like that.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=14s)** — But I will guarantee you do not know these.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=17s)** — Now, I'm going to break this up in two sections.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=19s)** — The first part of this video is for the person who wants just bare bones information.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=25s)** — They don't want anything too tactical.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=26s)** — And then the second part of the video, I'll go into those people who want the science behind it,
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=31s)** — the mechanism behind these symptoms, and like the underlying reason why they develop in the first place.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=36s)** — You have about 25,000 genes in your body and 10% of those genes are greatly influenced by vitamin D.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=44s)** — Not to mention when you get your blood tests with vitamin D, they're only showing you the inactive vitamin D.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=49s)** — They're not showing you what's happening in the cells.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=51s)** — And so the blood levels of vitamin D do not correlate very well with the vitamin D that are in your cells.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=57s)** — It's an active suppression of anything positive about vitamin D in the news, in medical research,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=64s)** — because it directly competes with the top selling drugs.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=67s)** — I got up and presented this data to, you know, these were the top vitamin D researchers in the world all assembled there.
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=74s)** — It was vicious. The attacks of how vitamin D doesn't do this. How could you say this?
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=80s)** — I said I'm just presenting the data that we have assembled.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=84s)** — You're walking on guys careers that have spent their whole career doing this stuff.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=88s)** — They never conceived that this could be true.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=91s)** — So let's dive in. Okay, number one, head sweating.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=94s)** — Now, typically you'll see this in infants, but you can also see it in teenagers, adults.
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=99s)** — But if you notice like a child or yourself sweating just more in the head, suspect a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=107s)** — Number two, sweating more at night, even if your temperature is cool.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=111s)** — Now this can also show up with your pillow being moist in the morning.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=116s)** — So excess sweating, especially at night, is a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=119s)** — Number three, mood swings.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=121s)** — A person going from a condition or emotion of happiness down to feeling irritable, down to angry.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=129s)** — And then they get sad because vitamin D controls the regulation of your mood.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=135s)** — And it heavily influences emotions.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=138s)** — And this has a lot to do with how vitamin D affects your brain.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=141s)** — But if you notice that yourself or a loved one is just like rollercoastering with these emotions,
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=145s)** — it could be a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=146s)** — Number four, procrastination, being backlogged, and you just don't feel productive.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=152s)** — I mean, it's pretty wild that someone's motivation is connected to a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=157s)** — Alright, number five, panic attacks.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=159s)** — Now in other videos, I talk about panic attacks being a vitamin B1 deficiency.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=164s)** — But you also have a vitamin D connection to this as well.
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=168s)** — A panic attack is a very severe fear or a very high anxiety condition.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=174s)** — And it definitely relates to certain hormones and neurotransmitters like serotonin.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=179s)** — But for those people out there that have panic attacks, resort to drugs,
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=182s)** — they might want to consider trying high doses of vitamin D3.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=186s)** — I've done videos on certain breathing techniques that a person can do as well, like breathing through your nose.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=190s)** — And I will put that link down below.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=192s)** — But don't forget vitamin D.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=194s)** — Number six, achiness in your pelvis, in your lower back, in your hips, in your upper legs.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=202s)** — Vitamin D is intimately connected with the formation of bone.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=206s)** — And one symptom of that is literally pain, but not sharp pain.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=213s)** — This achiness that's the inside of the bone because that's where you're losing the bone on the inside.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=218s)** — It's sad because it's so easy to fix, but you would have to take higher amounts, not lower amounts.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=223s)** — I'm talking like 10,000, 20,000 at least.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=226s)** — If you have any concern about 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3 being toxic,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=231s)** — I just want to let you know that being out in the sun in the summer for 40 minutes will give you 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=237s)** — Is that toxic? No.
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=239s)** — 200,000 IUs of vitamin D3 taken over months.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=244s)** — That's when you get into the toxic effect. Not 20,000 IUs.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=247s)** — So then we have number seven, which is loss of muscle strength.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=251s)** — Vitamin D has a direct effect on calcium itself.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=253s)** — And without vitamin D, calcium is going to be deficient in the muscle.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=257s)** — Calcium allows the muscle to contract, but not only contraction, it's also involved in the production of muscle itself.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=264s)** — So without vitamin D and calcium, you cannot create muscles.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=268s)** — And we also get this weakness within muscles that control power and strength, primarily your legs and your shoulders.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=275s)** — And on top of that, vitamin D also controls and regulates pain.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=280s)** — Number eight, stiffness. And the stiffness usually occurs in the knees and in the fingers.
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=286s)** — And of course, this definitely relates to inflammation, but it also has to do with what vitamin D does to your cartilage and your collagen.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=295s)** — So you might find that when you stretch backwards and create tension on the cartilage in your breastbone, you might feel stiffness in that area as well.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=304s)** — And that can also affect breathing, things like that.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=308s)** — Number nine, chronic fatigue. This has a lot to do with those little energy factories in your cell.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=315s)** — They're called mitochondria. And how important vitamin D is to support that little factory.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=322s)** — And if you don't have enough vitamin D, you just can't make energy.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=325s)** — Number ten, your ability to think quickly is diminished.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=330s)** — Basically, you have too many applications open on your desktop computer, but related to your brain.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=334s)** — And number eleven, it's just very difficult to be satisfied.
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=337s)** — When you eat a meal, it could be that the food is just nutritionally empty and you keep eating to get these nutrients.
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=345s)** — It can also be certain things in the food that cause you to be addicted.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=349s)** — But if you're low in vitamin D, you're just not going to feel satisfied.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=353s)** — You will definitely have a tendency to overeat.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=355s)** — So now that you know the general information, let me just kind of give you another layer of this data on each point, which is actually very interesting.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=363s)** — Okay, number one was head sweating.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=364s)** — There's something different about the head versus the rest of the body as far as certain sweat glands.
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=370s)** — We have a lot more sweat glands in our head than other parts of our body.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=374s)** — It affects the autonomic nervous system, causing this excess sweating in the head.
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=378s)** — Now, this also relates to number two when we talked about night sweats.
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=381s)** — But there's something else going on with night sweats.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=383s)** — Vitamin D suppresses an overactive immune system.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=387s)** — And just think about the immune system of all the things that happen.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=389s)** — One would be like a fever, right? That's a normal response.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=393s)** — And so when you're deficient in vitamin D and you have a slightly overreactive immune system,
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=399s)** — this whole mechanism of sweating is controlled by this little tiny computer chip in your brain called the hypothalamus.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=405s)** — And when you have a vitamin D deficiency in this overreactive immune system,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=408s)** — it's going to trigger excess sweating to compensate for this immune imbalance situation.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=413s)** — And one aspect of this is a fever.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=415s)** — Your body is generating more heat, and with that comes more sweat to compensate.
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=420s)** — All coming from a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=421s)** — Alright, number three is a mood swing.
- **[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=423s)** — Now when we kind of come up and down on this emotional roller coaster,
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=426s)** — you have your adrenals involved.
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=428s)** — Now the adrenal gland, starting with the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal is on this HPA axis,
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=434s)** — this circuit thing going on.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=436s)** — But when you're vitamin D deficient, cortisol is going to go up.
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=440s)** — Now, I don't know if this is just because it's trying to help you get rid of inflammation.
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=444s)** — I don't know about that.
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=445s)** — But with a vitamin D deficiency, you're going to have a dysregulation of this cortisol pattern.
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=449s)** — And if you have too much cortisol, it's going to put you more in a different emotional state.
- **[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=456s)** — Let's go to number four, which is low motivation to do.
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=459s)** — In the brain, there is this little center.
- **[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=461s)** — It's a tiny little nerve bundle.
- **[07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=465s)** — It's quite fascinating.
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=466s)** — It's called the nucleus accumbens.
- **[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=468s)** — And this is the heart of a lot of things, including addictions.
- **[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=474s)** — It kind of runs on dopamine.
- **[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=475s)** — And yes, dopamine is involved in addictions, but it's also a neurotransmitter that's involved with
- **[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=481s)** — motivation, reward, doing things, getting things done, that type of thing.
- **[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=487s)** — All right, number five, panic attacks, a high level anxiety, a very strong fear.
- **[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=494s)** — Panic attacks from a physical standpoint in the body are related to that structure I talked
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=499s)** — about in the brain called the amygdala.
- **[08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=502s)** — That's more like an adrenal in the brain.
- **[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=504s)** — It regulates fear.
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=506s)** — That needs vitamin D.
- **[08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=507s)** — We have several things going on.
- **[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=509s)** — We have serotonin, which is kind of like a happy hormone.
- **[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=513s)** — And so vitamin D is necessary to balance these two things.
- **[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=516s)** — All right, number six, achiness in the pelvis area, in the lower back,
- **[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=520s)** — in the upper thigh muscle.
- **[08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=522s)** — Now this relates to a condition called osteomalacia.
- **[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=526s)** — Now what is osteomalacia?
- **[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=528s)** — That's a severe vitamin D deficiency that's affecting the calcium in the bone.
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=531s)** — Now think about this.
- **[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=532s)** — Vitamin D deficiency is the number one cause of osteomalacia.
- **[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=536s)** — This is basically where the bones become very soft.
- **[08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=539s)** — I think this is going on in a massive scale in society right now,
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=543s)** — but they have a subclinical version of osteomalacia.
- **[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=546s)** — I think I had it in high school because I was eating poorly and I know I had a
- **[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=551s)** — vitamin D deficiency and I started getting fractures.
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=554s)** — But the bones are soft, certain proteins that are just not developing as well.
- **[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=558s)** — You have to realize that vitamin D controls calcium absorption by 20 times in the small intestine.
- **[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=565s)** — And in other videos, I talk about the two systems of vitamin D.
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=568s)** — You have the one that controls calcium and the other system that is non-calcium.
- **[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=573s)** — Yes, you can check the vitamin D in the blood.
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=575s)** — If you tested that, chances are that it's going to be pretty low.
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=578s)** — It's probably going to be 30 or less.
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=580s)** — In which case you just need to start taking vitamin D3.
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=583s)** — And I would take a lot of it.
- **[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=584s)** — I would take at least 10,000 to 20,000.
- **[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=589s)** — Until you can get your levels a little bit higher.
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=591s)** — For this bone problem, you could probably get away with taking it sporadically like once a week.
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=597s)** — If you want to do that. But I wouldn't do that if you had the problem.
- **[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=600s)** — So that's number six. Let's go to number seven.
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=602s)** — Loss of muscle strength. Why?
- **[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=604s)** — Because vitamin D controls calcium and calcium controls the contraction of the muscle.
- **[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=611s)** — If you're missing calcium because you don't have enough vitamin D and you can't contract,
- **[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=617s)** — what's going to happen with that muscle?
- **[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=618s)** — Pain that's kind of all over. It's hard to pinpoint. It's just achy.
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=622s)** — Alright, number eight is stiffness.
- **[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=624s)** — Mainly in the knees and the finger joints because the cartilage needs vitamin D and it's
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=630s)** — not getting vitamin D. So it's going to be more inflamed.
- **[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=633s)** — And the weight bearing joints on your knees could be the hips as well.
- **[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=637s)** — But also if you use the computer a lot or your fingers, you're going to notice in the
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=641s)** — fingers. This can definitely lead to osteoarthritis.
- **[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=644s)** — This is a lack of vitamin D.
- **[10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=646s)** — Vitamin D is essential for maintaining this cartilage and maintaining the ligaments and
- **[10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=652s)** — the tendons. And think about this.
- **[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=654s)** — Your ribs attached to the sternum with cartilage.
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=657s)** — So you're going to notice it right through here too.
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=660s)** — And so this is why stretching is so important to really keep this rib cage opened up.
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=667s)** — Because it'll tend to be contracted, inflamed and pull you forward down here.
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=671s)** — So you end up having bad posture and kind of a hunchback.
- **[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=674s)** — And not just take vitamin D, but they need to do a lot of stretching to reverse that.
- **[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=679s)** — All right, number nine, chronic fatigue syndrome.
- **[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=682s)** — There's two different reasons for chronic fatigue syndrome.
- **[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=685s)** — One is that your vitamin D controls the number of mitochondria that are produced.
- **[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=690s)** — The mitochondria are the energy factory.
- **[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=692s)** — So you're going to have less mitochondria.
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=693s)** — It's less energy.
- **[11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=694s)** — So without vitamin D, you're going to have dysfunctional mitochondria.
- **[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=697s)** — But the second reason for chronic fatigue syndrome is the immune connection.
- **[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=702s)** — If you are low in vitamin D, certain viruses will come out of remission and be active.
- **[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=709s)** — These viruses, especially the Epstein-Barr virus, will start to come out of remission and be
- **[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=714s)** — active. One of the symptoms that they produce is fatigue.
- **[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=718s)** — So it's not like you have this full-blown infection.
- **[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=721s)** — Now you get certain aspects of that infection, like chronic fatigue.
- **[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=725s)** — Nearly 100% of the people that have this reactivation of this Epstein-Barr virus
- **[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=730s)** — or chronic fatigue syndrome, it came after a severe loss.
- **[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=734s)** — Loss of a loved one or loss of a job or something like that.
- **[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=737s)** — But also it could be a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=740s)** — Which by the way, if you have vitamin D deficiency and you go through a loss,
- **[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=743s)** — boy, that stress is going to hit you a lot harder.
- **[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=746s)** — You just need a lot of vitamin D.
- **[12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=747s)** — I would take 50,000. I use a vitamin D3 every single day
- **[12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=751s)** — to pull yourself out of chronic fatigue syndrome.
- **[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=754s)** — Alright, number 10.
- **[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=756s)** — Mental sluggishness or slowness with decisions.
- **[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=758s)** — Thinking, focus is distracted.
- **[12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=761s)** — Vitamin D has a profound effect in the front part of the brain,
- **[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=764s)** — which kind of our relay system.
- **[12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=766s)** — And even communication between one neuron and the next needs vitamin D3.
- **[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=773s)** — And then we get to the last one. Feeling satisfied.
- **[12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=775s)** — So leptin tells the brain that you're full.
- **[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=778s)** — If you don't have enough vitamin D, it's not going to work that well.
- **[13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=781s)** — Vitamin D helps make leptin work better.
- **[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=784s)** — Then we also have insulin.
- **[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=785s)** — If you don't have enough vitamin D, insulin doesn't work as well.
- **[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=789s)** — And you're going to be hungry.
- **[13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=791s)** — Insulin allows all the nutrition to go into the cells.
- **[13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=793s)** — So if you have insulin resistance, because you're low in vitamin D,
- **[13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=797s)** — you're not going to be satisfied.
- **[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=798s)** — So just by taking vitamin D, insulin becomes more sensitive
- **[13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=801s)** — and you start getting more fuel to the cells.
- **[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=803s)** — You get more nutrients in the cells.
- **[13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=805s)** — I hope this helped you to understand these bizarre,
- **[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=807s)** — unusual symptoms of vitamin D deficiency.
- **[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=810s)** — Start taking vitamin D. Make sure you also take magnesium,
- **[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=813s)** — vitamin K2, zinc, and B6 as the cofactors to prevent any issues
- **[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=819s)** — and just to help it work better.
- **[13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXq2ZdXXFCU&t=820s)** — Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.
