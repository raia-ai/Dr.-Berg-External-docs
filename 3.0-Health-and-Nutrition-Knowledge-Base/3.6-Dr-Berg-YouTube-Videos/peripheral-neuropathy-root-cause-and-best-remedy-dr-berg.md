- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=0s)** — I'd like to show you how to not only get rid of the symptom of peripheral neuropathy,
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=6s)** — but also the root cause as well. Now, many doctors, practitioners will just tell you what remedy to
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=13s)** — use without really giving you the understanding of this root mechanism in a simple way. That's
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=21s)** — what I want to do with you because once you really understand this, it's very unlikely you're
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=26s)** — ever going to get it again because you're going to know exactly what to do. Diabetic neuropathy
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=31s)** — is a condition that affects usually the bottom of your feet and sometimes the hands. Now, of course,
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=38s)** — the question is why does it affect those areas? Well, it's one of the first signs that you're
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=44s)** — having some pretty severe problems with your blood sugar. And because you have very long
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=48s)** — nerves in the body, the very last end of the nerve is going to be affected first because
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=54s)** — that's the area of your body that gets the least amount of oxygen or fuel compared to
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=60s)** — some nerves that are closer to the heart. And I'm primarily going to focus on diabetes
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=64s)** — and blood sugar problems because there are other causes of peripheral neuropathy, but not
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=69s)** — as common. Like, for example, chemotherapy could cause it. Hypothyroidism could cause it.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=75s)** — Some type of autoimmune disease, some medication of virus, and Lyme disease.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=80s)** — Diabetes tends to affect four tissues, nerves, arteries, eyes, kidneys. But this
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=88s)** — peripheral neuropathy can be a real pain because you have to walk. Sometimes it's hypersensitive,
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=93s)** — sometimes it's burning, sometimes it's severe pain, and sometimes it's just itching. But
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=99s)** — there's some weird thing going on with the nerve. And the problem is over time, if we don't
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=104s)** — it could end up with ulcers in your lower part of your body, gangrene. But when you understand
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=110s)** — the mechanism, the solution is really simple. So a couple things going on with the nerves on
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=115s)** — the bottom of your feet. If you look right here, you'll see this insulated wire, right?
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=121s)** — This would be compared to an insulation around your nerves. And that insulation is
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=126s)** — called myelin. And what happens with a diabetic is the myelin is breaking down to
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=132s)** — point where you have like a raw nerve. The second thing is you're getting a lack of blood flow to
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=137s)** — or circulation in general, nerve and blood flow to the bottom of your feet. Because you're not
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=144s)** — getting the circulation because there's damage in the vascular system, you're going to
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=149s)** — basically have nerves that are getting starved. But I'm going to go a little bit deeper, but
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=153s)** — in a simple way, because I really want you to understand what's happening at the cellular
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=158s)** — level. Because if you remember in some of my other videos, I talk about the mitochondria,
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=163s)** — which is this little energy factory. And what happens when you consume too much sugar,
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=170s)** — as in a diabetic situation, you overload the motor. Okay, but really there's a kind of a
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=177s)** — pre-motor even before the mitochondria that has to break down glucose into something that
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=184s)** — mitochondria can use. That is where the real problem is. Because we start with maybe glucose,
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=191s)** — and then it goes through all these different steps on this assembly line to the point where
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=197s)** — eventually the mitochondria can use that fuel and then everything works nicely, right? But
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=203s)** — in the last step of this assembly line, there's an enzyme that stops working because
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=209s)** — you're overloading this carburetor with too much fuel and you put out the spark plug
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=215s)** — like vitamins and minerals. This problem really is a nutrient deficiency because when you consume
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=221s)** — so much sugar going through the bloodstream, the increased demand for nutrients goes way, way,
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=227s)** — way, way up. And so eventually you're going to deplete these nutrients from your tissues
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=231s)** — and you're going to be high and dry. There's not going to be any nutrients there for the
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=235s)** — glucose to be able to convert into the form of fuel that your mitochondria needs. So you can
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=242s)** — imagine it's kind of like this biochemical pathway that you now get this bottleneck.
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=246s)** — It just kind of dams up and then that backs up in the system and creates lactic acid doses
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=252s)** — and for radical damage and all sorts of issues. Enzymes basically do all the work in the body.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=258s)** — They can transform one thing to another thing. And all these enzymes have coenzymes or co
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=265s)** — factors, which basically are the vitamins and minerals. But I just want to interject one other
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=270s)** — additional thing that happens in this process. Your body has all sorts of backup plans, like a
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=276s)** — plan B to try to give the body energy. So one alternative pathway, the byproduct of that
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=282s)** — pathway is sorbitol, which is a sugar alcohol. Here's the problem with sorbitol.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=289s)** — Sorbitol gets stuck in certain tissues, like the lens of the eye, to cause cataracts, like the
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=299s)** — retina, which causes diabetic retinopathy, which is a problem with the retina. Because
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=306s)** — what's happening, the cells are swelling up. Also, sorbitol gets into the cells that make
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=312s)** — insulation around the wire, around the nerve. That swells up and that breaks up and goes haywire.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=320s)** — And then sorbitol also can convert to fructose, which creates more problems. The big question is,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=327s)** — what are these co factors that allow that enzyme to work and start to heal these nerves
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=333s)** — so you can get rid of the pain? The first one is vitamin B1. But here's the big problem.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=338s)** — If you try to get your B1 from your diet when you've already had diabetes, you're going to have
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=343s)** — a really hard time because you would need a lot of it therapeutically to fix this problem. And
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=351s)** — this is a common thing that I hear even with doctors that don't really understand nutrition.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=354s)** — They'll say, well, you can get all your nutrients from your food. Well, maybe some,
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=358s)** — but it's really hard to get all of your nutrients, especially if you're trying to
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=362s)** — therapeutically correct something. Now, can you just take B1? Well, here's the problem with B1.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=369s)** — B1 is water soluble. So the water soluble has a hard time getting into that fat soluble
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=375s)** — nerve to fix it. So it's a synthetically made fat soluble B1. It's called Benfotamine.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=382s)** — Normally it comes in, I think 300 milligrams. You take just one of those four times a day.
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=387s)** — Sometimes supplements come with the next remedy I'm going to talk about, and that's called
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=390s)** — Lipoic acid. Lipoic acid is another co-factor for that enzyme that's not working. And this is
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=398s)** — based on working with tens of thousands of people over 30 years. And I had a huge practice
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=404s)** — with a lot of diabetics. So I've used this over and over. So I have a lot of experience
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=409s)** — getting success with this condition. There's three more nutrients that are involved.
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=415s)** — Vitamin B5, vitamin B2, and vitamin B3. Those are all the co-factors for that enzyme to allow
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=424s)** — you to metabolize the glucose. So then it can be converted to something that your mitochondria
- **[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=431s)** — can actually use. So hypothetically you could actually be a diabetic and not have peripheral
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=436s)** — neuropathy if you took a lot of this nutrition. But why would you want to do that?
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=440s)** — Why not correct it by lowering the carb? Okay, so you want to go on low carb plus
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=445s)** — intermittent fasting. Now there's another reason why you want to do this because diabetes over
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=452s)** — time chronically creates a cascade of all sorts of problems that go very deep into your nervous
- **[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=460s)** — system up into the brain. On one hand, the first type of symptoms are the foot pain and the
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=466s)** — pain. Things like that. But then it can spread to other parts of your body, especially the
- **[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=472s)** — autonomic nervous system. Constipation, you might get stomach pain, things like that.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=477s)** — You might start having heart problems. Now you could just change your diet, right? And you're
- **[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=483s)** — going to feel great relief on the bottom of your foot. But I've noticed certain people
- **[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=489s)** — get relief but it doesn't always go away 100% unless they do high doses of benfotaminolipoic
- **[08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=496s)** — acid. But ultimately, it's very, very important to correct the real problem,
- **[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO3X3WNR5Jg&t=500s)** — which is the diet. And for that, you need to study and watch this video right here.
