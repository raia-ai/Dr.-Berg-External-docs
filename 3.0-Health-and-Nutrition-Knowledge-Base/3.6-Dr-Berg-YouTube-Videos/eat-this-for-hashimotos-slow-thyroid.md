- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=0s)** — Would you be willing to consume two of these each day to help prepare your thyroid?
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=6s)** — And I'm talking about Brazil nuts for a very specific reason.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=12s)** — Most hypo low thyroid condition problems is Hashimoto's. This is an autoimmune problem.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=20s)** — It's not usually related to lacking iodine, but Hashimoto's is the most common type of autoimmune
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=26s)** — disease of all the autoimmune diseases. 14 million people a year get it just in the U.S. alone.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=32s)** — And when you have Hashimoto's, you're more at risk of developing other types of autoimmune diseases
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=37s)** — as well. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is inflammation of the thyroid, doesn't always
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=43s)** — cause hypothyroidism, but usually it does. And so what's fascinating about these Brazil nuts
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=49s)** — is their selenium content and what selenium can do for Hashimoto's. I mean, it's
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=55s)** — First of all, selenium is a trace mineral needed in very tiny amounts. Selenium is involved in
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=61s)** — over 25 different genes involving antioxidants, giving anti-inflammatory effects. Selenium also is
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=69s)** — in shellfish and seafood and organ meats, but it's the highest in Brazil nuts. And so if you
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=76s)** — had two of these nuts, you would get close to like 200 micrograms of selenium every single day.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=81s)** — In 17 randomized control trials, it has been shown that selenium reduces the antibodies
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=90s)** — that are attacking your thyroid and selenium can slow down that attack. Even the way they
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=96s)** — diagnose thyroid conditions like hypothyroidism, they look at the hormone that's released from
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=101s)** — the pituitary that goes down to the thyroid. It's called the thyroid stimulating hormone. And
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=106s)** — that hormone goes up. That means it's not connecting with the thyroid. And chances are you have a
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=112s)** — hypothyroid condition. Well, it just so happens that selenium also helps that condition too.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=119s)** — With an Hashimoto's situation, you have a lot of hydrogen peroxide being generated. So by
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=125s)** — taking selenium, you can help neutralize the effect of hydrogen peroxide. And even too much
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=132s)** — hydrogen peroxide itself can trigger an autoimmune disease. Selenium also controls the T helper
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=140s)** — cells that orchestrate the entire immune response. And it also feeds the T reg cells,
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=148s)** — preventing autoimmune diseases. And because our brain and our immune system and our reproductive
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=155s)** — system are so heavily dependent on selenium, there's probably not a lot left for the
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=161s)** — to have enough to function correctly. And so the person starts developing this Hashimoto's and
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=168s)** — they start getting tired, cold, they gain weight, hair loss, the hair becomes brittle.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=173s)** — So here's what I would recommend. Start consuming two Brazil nuts per day. I mean, you could
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=177s)** — take a little bit more, maybe up to four, but I wouldn't take more than that. Because
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=181s)** — you can have problems with the deficiency of selenium and also a problem if you have too
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=185s)** — much selenium too. So you just need the right amount. In addition to Brazil nuts, I would
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=190s)** — also recommend either getting enough sun or taking high doses of vitamin D3. Why? Because
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=197s)** — vitamin D3 also helps to regulate an overactive immune system. Now, since I mentioned a little
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=204s)** — bit about vitamin D, I think there's some more to know about vitamin D in relationship
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iARMPdrblY&t=208s)** — to autoimmune diseases. So for that information, I put it up right here. Check it out.
