- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=0s)** — Now I have a very simple, inexpensive tip for you that I think can not only help you with your hair,
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=7s)** — your nails, and having useful skin, but a lot more. In fact, you may find that this natural remedy
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=14s)** — solves many of the problems that you have right now. And this all wraps around this one topic of
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=19s)** — collagen. What is collagen? It's your connective tissue, tendons, ligaments, cartilage. One third
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=26s)** — of all of your collagen is made by one amino acid, glycine. And glycine is not an essential
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=33s)** — amino acid, which means that our bodies can make it. But here's the thing, our bodies really
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=39s)** — don't make enough glycine. And if you're not getting it from the diet, chances are you're
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=45s)** — going to be deficient. Because normal proteins, red meat, or chicken, or fish, or even eggs,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=52s)** — or even dairy, are not very high in glycine. You'd have to be eating the skin on the chicken
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=58s)** — and the cartilage, like on the chicken bones, or organ meats. And a lot of people do not do that.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=64s)** — So we can be consuming a lot of protein, but not getting this one amino acid that could
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=68s)** — lead to all sorts of issues. Check this out. Glycine is needed to make the most important
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=76s)** — of all your cells. That's called glutathione. If you don't have glycine, you can't make
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=82s)** — glutathione, which means you can't detoxify. Which means that you're going to have a buildup
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=86s)** — of toxicity, which relates to inflammation. This is one of the reasons why glycine is
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=93s)** — very anti-inflammatory. So glycine is very, very important for your liver. Glycine is also
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=98s)** — used to help with a leaky gut because it helps prevent inflammation in your gut, which I've
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=105s)** — talked about this extensively in many different videos, as the gut inflammatory conditions
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=111s)** — are the start of autoimmune diseases. Glycine is also used in a lot of enzymes
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=117s)** — in different proteins. One being called catalase, which helps you get rid of hydrogen
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=123s)** — peroxide in the body, which also could explain why someone could have premature
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=127s)** — graying of the hair, because the hydrogen peroxide is just bleaching out the pigment
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=131s)** — in the hair. Glycine is essential to make the heme in your blood. So if you don't have
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=136s)** — glycine, you can't make blood. And even your gums around the teeth need glycine. Glycine
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=140s)** — is so foundational, you need it for your DNA as well. If you're deficient in glycine,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=144s)** — you might not be able to achieve the deep delta wave sleep that you need to feel regenerated.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=149s)** — Also, I found that glycine is very important in helping people detoxify uric acid. And so
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=157s)** — it's even used as a treatment for gout, because glycine competes with uric acid. And glycine is
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=164s)** — also good to make your insulin more sensitive. So it's really good for blood sugars and can
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=169s)** — help you with a lot of different things. Weight loss, fatty liver, visceral fat. In fact,
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=174s)** — the Greek word for glycine means sweet. It can actually even be turned into glucose as fuel.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=180s)** — You see, certain parts of the body, especially the brain, need a certain level of glucose.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=185s)** — But if you're not consuming sugar, your body will make it. Well, guess what? Glycine can be a
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=192s)** — precursor for that sugar. And I think some people might be concerned too, if that's going
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=195s)** — to bump me out of ketosis. If I take glycine, it's going to increase my sugar. But at the
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=200s)** — same time, look at the benefits. It actually helps stabilize your blood sugar, as well as
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=205s)** — maybe a little bit more insulin spike. But it's going to make insulin more sensitive. So it's
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=210s)** — more corrective on insulin versus regular sugar that doesn't improve your blood sugars.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=217s)** — But there's something else that's interesting when you consume glycine. It stimulates the
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=221s)** — opposing hormone to insulin, which is called glucagon. Glucagon does the opposite of insulin.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=228s)** — And this is why when you're consuming amino acids, protein, you don't really have to be
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=235s)** — concerned about the blood sugar spike. But it also at the same time, stimulates the opposing
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=242s)** — hormone to keep things in check. And if something could make insulin more sensitive, it's not
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=246s)** — going to worsen the insulin resistance situation. It's going to help it. And I also read a
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=250s)** — study, which I'm going to put all the stuff down below, on how glycine could even interfere
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=256s)** — with the binding of oxalates to calcium crystallization to prevent kidney stones. So
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=264s)** — here's how someone's deficient. First of all, the diet, if you're not consuming nose to tail,
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=270s)** — if you're not eating all the things with collagen, then chances are you could be
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=275s)** — deficient because our bodies don't make enough. There's a massive demand for glycine if you're
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=281s)** — under stress, if you're taking medications, if you're drinking alcohol, if you're exposed to
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=286s)** — toxins, if your liver is working overtime to get rid of poisons for some reason.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=292s)** — Just so happens that one third of collagen is glycine. And a real simple way to get collagen is
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=300s)** — gelatin Knox blocks. You can buy it in these packets. You can get it on Amazon. You can look
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=304s)** — it up, pull a little stevia in it and consume that on a regular basis to get your glycine.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=310s)** — I think that's a really easy way to get your glycine. Now you can also get a supplement
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=315s)** — with glycine. And if you do, the amounts that an average person need would range anywhere
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=320s)** — between four grams to 10 grams a day. Here's some other ways you can get collagen. You can do
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=329s)** — bone broth. The problem with bone broth, you'd have to have a lot of it to get enough glycine,
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=334s)** — but that's a possibility. Another way to do it is to have chicken soup and you take the whole
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=339s)** — chicken, put it in the crock pot and just cook it all day long and see if all this
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=344s)** — great collagen, which is very high in glycine, you can even do like pork rinds, right? Just
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=349s)** — make sure it doesn't have added MSG or other chemicals. You'd have to have a good amount of
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=354s)** — it, but it can contribute to your glycine. So in different countries, they do it differently.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=358s)** — They might in certain countries use, just cook the entire fish with the head and everything
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=364s)** — to make their broth. Certain people have recipes for chicken feed or they cook their
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=370s)** — bone down in some broth. So there's many different ways to get collagen. You may have
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=375s)** — term hydrolyzed collagen, right? What does hydrolyze mean? It basically means you're breaking
- **[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=381s)** — down the protein into smaller chains. Okay. They're called peptide chains. So it's just an
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=386s)** — easier way to get your collagen because it's already broken down. And also beyond Knox
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=390s)** — blocks, gelatin. There's another great product called Great Lakes beef gelatin. If you do
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=395s)** — take glycine, okay, do you have to be concerned about taking too much of it? Yes,
- **[06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=401s)** — but you would have to have something like 600 grams. Okay. 600 grams. We're only talking
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=407s)** — about between four and 10 grams a day. If possible, I would recommend taking the glycine
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=413s)** — with food, not an empty stomach. But here's the thing as we age, the need for glycine goes
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=418s)** — up. This could potentially help people with osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, thinning of the
- **[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=428s)** — insomnia, gout, or even kidney stones. Now I did another video on this topic related to hair
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=434s)** — loss. If you haven't seen that one, you should check it out. A lot of people watched it. They
- **[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiybCei-ls&t=439s)** — loved it. I put it up right here.
