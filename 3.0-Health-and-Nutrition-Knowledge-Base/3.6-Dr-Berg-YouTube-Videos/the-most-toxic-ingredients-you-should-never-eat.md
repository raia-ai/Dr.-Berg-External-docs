- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=7s)** — chronic health problems. So check this out. Let's start with some granola bars. Do a little scan.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=12s)** — Wow! 28% sugar, 15% seed oil, and 41% starch. Let's go with Cheetos. Do a little scan. Boom!
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=21s)** — Oh, look at that! Zero sugar, but 35% seed oils and 52% starch. Let's see what's in Coca-Cola.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=29s)** — Do a little scan. It's all sugar. No surprises there. And of course, high fructose corn syrup
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=35s)** — sugar. Let's try some healthy cereal. Lucky charms. Do a little scan on the barcode and
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=40s)** — wow! 40% sugar, 40% starch. And by the way, starch is hidden sugar. Let's look at mayonnaise.
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=49s)** — Do a little scan. Yeah, I'm not surprised. 82% seed oils. Let's check out Nature's Own
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=56s)** — White bread. Do a little scan. 57% starch, 4% seed oils, and 6% sugar. The biggest realization
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=64s)** — I had in this project was that the great majority of all junk food, this stuff right
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=69s)** — here, mostly is three simple ingredients. Sugar right here. Okay, sugar. Then we have
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=75s)** — the starches, right? But not just any starch. Highly industrial processed corn starch. And
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=82s)** — my favorite is seed oils. These are the three ingredients. And we're not talking like really
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=89s)** — healthy seed oils. We're talking about seed oils that are so rancid, so oxidized,
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=94s)** — they're going to go into your cell membranes and create a lot of inflammation. And if you
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=98s)** — were to eat this right now, this disgusting mixture, you would probably vomit. What they
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=103s)** — had to do was they had to add artificial flavors. Then they would have to add
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=108s)** — to it. And then they have to put some chemicals to preserve it. And then more chemicals to make
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=113s)** — you keep eating it called MSG. And what's interesting about this slop is there's barely
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=119s)** — any protein. And one reason they don't put protein is that protein is satisfying. But
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=123s)** — without protein, it's going to make you want to keep eating it over and over and over again.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=126s)** — But to get you to buy this, we have to create incredible packaging. Look at how amazing.

- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=143s)** — life. The big problem with processed foods, ultra processed foods, junk foods, is that they're
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=147s)** — just basically dead. There's no longer any phytonutrients or vitamins or minerals. They
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=152s)** — have to add some of those in later. And they're basically synthetic. They just put a
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=156s)** — couple more vitamins in there because if they didn't, you would develop all sorts of diseases.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=160s)** — Like a vitamin B3 deficiency is called polygara, where your skin looks like leprosy. Junk food
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=166s)** — does not fit the definition of actual food. There's another thing that I think a person needs
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=170s)** — to put on the radar and that has to do with starches. Starch is a chain of sugar molecules.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=178s)** — And when you process it, heating it, grinding it, putting chemicals in it, that starch now
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=184s)** — that has become severely altered or manipulated will act worse than sugar. In this app that you
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=196s)** — And just to point on this heart healthy seed oils, the problem with these oils is they actually
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=202s)** — get lodged in your membranes. It's in the organs. It's in your brain. The problem is,
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=206s)** — is now it's going to take about a year and a half to get that out of the body.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=209s)** — If you were to use this app to identify these three things in your pantry and your
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=214s)** — refrigerator and avoid them, your health benefits would be amazing. The average person

- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=256s)** — starches and seed oils, the magnitude of what that does to our bodies compared to everything

- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=305s)** — food. We then looked at every single ingredient on each food item and I had to manually
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=310s)** — teach him the difference between junk food and real food, which took a very long time.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SjqPQL6WM&t=315s)** — I mean, memorizing every single ingredient is just overwhelming for the average person.
