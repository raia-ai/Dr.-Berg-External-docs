- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=0s)** — So the topic of today is oatmeal. And I used to love oatmeal. I used to have it every single day
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=7s)** — as a breakfast. And I was told that it was healthy. And so today I want to share three things that
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=15s)** — you probably have never heard before relating to oatmeal. And the reason I'm bringing this up is
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=20s)** — because if you're consuming oatmeal for health reasons, you may change your mind after watching
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=26s)** — this video. Now of course I'm not telling you not to consume oatmeal. I just want to give you some
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=31s)** — additional information to think with that is not necessarily easy to find when you type oatmeal
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=38s)** — on the internet. And I'm not going to even cover what you probably already know.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=42s)** — The sugary type of oatmeal in these little packets. This instant oatmeal, tons of sugar.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=47s)** — You know you already know that's really bad. I want to talk about the oatmeal that's actually
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=51s)** — But it's interesting even in the packets of instant oatmeal that has tons of sugar,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=58s)** — apparently you could still have a little claim there that says that it's heart healthy.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=62s)** — I mean you'll see articles out there that will say that oatmeal is one of the
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=66s)** — healthiest foods that you can possibly eat. It's considered a superfood. It will lower your
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=71s)** — cholesterol. It will help your diabetes and blood sugars. It will make your heart healthy.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=77s)** — So the first thing I want to dive into, I'm going to put a bunch of studies down below so
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=80s)** — you can verify what I'm saying is true, is some studies done on oatmeal in relationship to
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=88s)** — blood sugars and insulin as well as cholesterol. Now when you read these studies it does
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=94s)** — definitely say that there is a significant improvement in cholesterol as well as blood
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=101s)** — sugars. Okay both. And that's pretty exciting. I mean like wow because if something is
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=105s)** — cholesterol friendly or it's blood sugar friendly then you know sign me up. But if you actually
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=110s)** — read the studies it will say there's a significant decrease in cholesterol and blood glucose
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=116s)** — compared to the control. Now what does this mean compared to a control? What is that all
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=124s)** — about? Well you're comparing it to something else right? And that comparison is white bread.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=130s)** — That's right, white bread. So if you compare anything to white bread it's going to be better
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=137s)** — in a significant way. So let's say for example you eat some white bread okay and let's say
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=143s)** — it spikes your blood sugars by 10 points. And then when you eat the oats it only spikes
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=151s)** — your blood sugars by five points. And then we can say in the study there's a significant
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=155s)** — difference. There's a much less like 50% less spike in blood sugars than the controls. But
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=163s)** — that 50% improvement is not just you know adding this to your diet and seeing an improvement
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=168s)** — in blood sugars. It's compared to something else. And then when you read on in the study
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=172s)** — it says the improvement in blood sugars only occurred right after the meal okay. It didn't
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=178s)** — occur later on probably because there's a nice spike of blood glucose when you eat white bread.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=185s)** — So that was one point. The other thing that they mentioned in the studies is that part of the
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=189s)** — study was just consuming three grams of beta-glucan. Not consuming oatmeal but just that
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=196s)** — compound and that created a lowering of cholesterol. And so then by inference you know
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=200s)** — we can just say well there's beta-glucan in oats and just by deductive reasoning it then
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=205s)** — must create the same effect. But that's a little confusing because that's an isolated
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=210s)** — compound versus eating it as a whole grain. And then there's other studies that 29 participants
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=216s)** — enrolled in the study. They all had diabetes and they did not see any change with blood
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=222s)** — glucose levels between the two. So when we talk about the benefit there's only certain
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=227s)** — studies are talking about. And so when they quote it's heart healthy they're kind of
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=232s)** — cherry picking certain parts of studies and not giving you the full understanding of what it
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=238s)** — is going to do to your cholesterol levels or blood sugars. In fact the best thing I think
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=243s)** — you should do is just start testing your blood sugars when you consume it and then
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=246s)** — not consume it and then you'll know for yourself. But also I could not find any of
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=251s)** — these studies involving the instant oatmeal with all the added sugar. Okay somehow those
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=256s)** — studies are really hard to find in relationship to them improving your blood glucose levels
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=262s)** — insulin levels or cholesterol levels. The next topic is gluten free right because we all know
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=268s)** — that oats are gluten free. Well apparently they do have a type of gluten. It's called avanin.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=277s)** — Okay and this protein has been known to increase cytokines which are like an inflammatory
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=284s)** — response in your body. But here's the catch 22 it's delayed you may not feel any symptoms
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=293s)** — for days later so it's going to be very hard to make the connection between
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=297s)** — the two. But if you have irritable bowel syndrome or inflammation or celiac you may find
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=306s)** — that eating oats can worsen the situation. And you have to realize that these glutens,
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=312s)** — which is just a category of a lot of different types of proteins, is like one of the primary
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=318s)** — triggers for autoimmune diseases especially Hashimoto's which is a thyroid problem.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=325s)** — Number three, wheat killer called glyphosate. It's interesting that the FDA when they did
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=331s)** — the reports for studies on different foods they kind of omitted oats for some reason. But we
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=337s)** — have to worry about that because Monsanto did their own studies and that was the creator of
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=342s)** — glyphosate and they said that it's completely safe so we don't really have to worry about that.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=348s)** — But of course the World Health Organization did say that glyphosate is a carcinogen and there
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=354s)** — was a lawsuit that was won in court by someone being exposed to glyphosate and winning
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=361s)** — millions of dollars because they developed cancer. And the type of cancer apparently increases the
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=366s)** — risk for is called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. But another organization called EWG, which I'll put a
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=373s)** — link down below, when they found traces of glyphosate, wheat killer, in over 95% of samples
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=380s)** — of oat products. And it's not that this oat is genetically modified. They use glyphosate
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=388s)** — as a pre-harvest drying agent because it can kill the plant really quick and dry it up.
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=396s)** — And that's what they use not only in oats but in wheat. I mean this kind of goes beyond the
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=402s)** — genetically modified foods like in the corn, the soy, canola, that type of thing. So anyway,
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=408s)** — if you do have oats, of course, you know, steel cut would be much better than the the
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=415s)** — instant oats. And if you're going to eat it, make sure it's organic, okay? Unless you want
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=420s)** — some wheat killer in there. But you may also want to try something. You might want to just
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=424s)** — skip your breakfast altogether and do intermittent fasting. You'll probably be shocked to find out
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=429s)** — how good you actually feel by not doing a breakfast in general. But that being said,
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=434s)** — if you want to do a breakfast, I think eggs would be a much better choice. Now, since we're
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=438s)** — on the topic of breakfast, if you have not seen my video on how to transition out of
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faup23zVDJU&t=445s)** — doing a breakfast and the benefits, I put that video up right here. Check it out.
