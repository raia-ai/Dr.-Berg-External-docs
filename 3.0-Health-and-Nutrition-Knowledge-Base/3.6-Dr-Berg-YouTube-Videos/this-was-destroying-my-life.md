- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=0s)** — How do you go back to sleep if for some reason you wake up between 2 to 3 a.m. in the middle of the night?
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=8s)** — I would consider myself an expert at insomnia because I had this for over a decade and it was
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=14s)** — destroying my life. It was not just getting up at 2 or 3 in the morning. Sometimes I wouldn't even
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=19s)** — sleep for one minute the entire night. I would lay there. It was basically torture. What's
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=29s)** — rhythm with cortisol? This is a stress hormone. Cortisol should be at the lowest point in this
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=36s)** — rhythm at 2 a.m. and the highest point at 8 a.m. For me, everything was backwards. I was very, very
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=42s)** — awake at 2, but I was extremely tired at 8 a.m. in the morning. I tried everything. I even tried
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=48s)** — prescription medications. It didn't work. In fact, what I didn't know at the time was those
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=53s)** — medications actually worsen your cortisol. They raise your cortisol. We can also look at things
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=59s)** — that help you lower cortisol. One big one is magnesium. Magnesium has the ability to actually
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=67s)** — lower cortisol. Your cortisol can actually go up if you're deficient in magnesium. Also,
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=72s)** — if you're sitting there watching right now and you have any tightness in your muscle in your
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=76s)** — upper back, lower back, or if you point your toe and it cramps, that's a sure sign that
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=82s)** — you are deficient in magnesium. The type of magnesium that I would recommend to take is
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=85s)** — called magnesium glycinate. It can actually help relax your muscles and help reduce cortisol.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=91s)** — When you want to take it is at night before you go to bed. Towards the later part of the
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=95s)** — morning, right around 6 o'clock a.m., is when you have the least amount of magnesium in
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=100s)** — your tissues. This is also probably why a lot of health problems occur in the early morning,
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=106s)** — like heart attacks, stroke, restless leg syndrome, because a lot of these things are influenced
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=112s)** — by magnesium. One last indication of magnesium deficiency is twitching. So if you're getting this
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=118s)** — twitch underneath your eye or in your arm, that's a sure sign that you are deficient in
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=122s)** — magnesium. Magnesium controls calcium and when you don't have enough magnesium, you get more
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=127s)** — calcium and calcium just causes cramping in different areas of the body. The other thing
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=132s)** — that can raise cortisol at 2 a.m. is a low blood sugar situation. Let's say your diet is
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=140s)** — heavy in the carbohydrates and so you raise your blood sugar, go to sleep at night and the blood sugar
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=146s)** — goes down. Guess what happens when your blood sugar goes too low? The body's going to raise it.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=151s)** — How does it raise it? With cortisol because of your diet. We've talked about magnesium
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=156s)** — deficiency and by the way, when you eat a lot of carbohydrates and starches, that creates
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=161s)** — the magnesium deficiency. But if you're just eating sugar in general, you're going to have
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=166s)** — a blood sugar issue that's going to affect cortisol and wake you up in the middle of the night.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=170s)** — This is what you should do. If you're getting up at 2 a.m. you want to evaluate what you ate the day
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=175s)** — before. Did you have fine starches? Do you go out to a restaurant? Did they give you something called
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=180s)** — MSG which also can affect your blood sugar? Also alcohol. Alcohol will really make you feel
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=187s)** — like you're sleeping but you're not really sleeping that well. You're probably going to wake
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=191s)** — up at 2 or even 3. The snack at night, you're going to raise your blood sugar and it's
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=200s)** — so important not to snack after 6 30. Let's say for example, you ate very very late at night
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=207s)** — and you ate a lot of protein. Protein tends to stimulate the body and that can interrupt your
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=213s)** — sleep. In fact, one thing that I find that really works for my sleep is if I have my last
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=219s)** — meal later in the afternoon and then I don't eat after that. Boy, do I sleep a lot better
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=224s)** — if I don't eat too late at night. Another thing with salt cravings. Let's say for example,
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=230s)** — you crave salty chips at night. The reason why people crave salt is because they're usually
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=236s)** — deficient in sodium. Sodium helps lower cortisol. When you're deficient in sodium
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=242s)** — or you're not having enough salt, your cortisol will go up. Add more sea salt to the
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=248s)** — meal through the day. Do that to the point where you crave no salt at night. Another thing
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=253s)** — will increase cortisol is watching a suspense or action movie before you go to sleep. This is
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=260s)** — why I watch boring movies or something that's really light because if I watch an exciting movie,
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=266s)** — I'm not going to sleep at night. It's also important not to have the blue light from
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=271s)** — this thing or your computer before going to sleep because the blue light interferes with
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=276s)** — melatonin that helps you wind down and go to sleep. Another thing that can increase melatonin
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=282s)** — at night is getting enough sun exposure. Getting more sun during the day does definitely help you
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=289s)** — sleep at night. Over 50% of the sun as well as the light from a fire or even candles can give
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=296s)** — you infrared. That infrared will increase melatonin in the cells. If you're deficient in B1,
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=303s)** — you're going to have a lot of energy in your body because you have more of an energy
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=306s)** — capacity problem that you have to do something to get that energy out of your body. So if
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=310s)** — you don't exercise, you're going to have a harder time going to sleep. So I highly recommend you
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=314s)** — go for long walks, do some workout that will get you tired. But I have to work out to get
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=320s)** — the energy out of my body. Another thing that can affect your sleep at 2 or 3 am is something
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=326s)** — going on with your liver. The liver is the organ that detoxifies between one and three in
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=333s)** — the middle of the night. If there's anything that's related to that, let's say alcohol,
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=338s)** — you're trying to get rid of alcohol or you're taking medications that your liver is trying
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=342s)** — to get rid of something that can throw off your sleep. Take milk thistle before you go to
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=347s)** — bed. That's really good for the liver. Another thing that happened with me is restless leg
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=352s)** — syndrome. That is a classic B1 deficiency or it's a magnesium deficiency. Probably because
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=359s)** — you're consuming too many carbs. I was. If you can just fix that, you won't have restless
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=364s)** — legs anymore. It's a real easy thing to fix. Just start consuming natural B1 and magnesium
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=369s)** — before bed. Check your pulse rate because if your pulse rate is too high, that could be
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=374s)** — a potassium deficiency. I remember one time I was trying to sleep and I noticed like I felt
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=379s)** — this pounding and I checked my pulse rate. I'm like, oh my gosh, my pulse rate is like boom,
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=383s)** — boom, boom, boom, boom. There's two things that cause a high pulse rate. It's low
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=387s)** — potassium, usually because you're eating too many carbs or your pH is too acidic. In the
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=393s)** — case of me, I would take kombucha tea or I would do apple cider vinegar right before bed
- **[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=398s)** — and I would take it too concentrated and that acidified myself. That was a problem that I ran
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=404s)** — into. For some people, drinking apple cider vinegar more diluted can help them, but also
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=409s)** — the apple cider vinegar really helps stabilize the blood sugars to the whole night. If you
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=413s)** — suspect blood sugar problems, apple cider vinegar is great before you go to bed and
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=418s)** — it'll also help you increase the absorption of certain minerals. And if that doesn't work and
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=422s)** — you're laying there for a longer period of time, I would pull out a book. Nothing too exciting.
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=427s)** — We just start reading a book until you get tired and fall asleep. The next day, what I
- **[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=432s)** — would do is I would go for a really long walk, not to raise the pulse rate, but just to
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=438s)** — kind of like have this a lot of oxygen. So you can kind of just drain out this cortisol
- **[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=443s)** — and adrenaline that has built up. Go ahead and try these things and then comment down below
- **[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ9xTMkGxXg&t=449s)** — how they've helped you.
