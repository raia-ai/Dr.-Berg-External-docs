- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=0s)** — Depression has absolutely nothing to do with your brain.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=4s)** — It has everything to do with your gut.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=7s)** — So many people have been operating off of this idea.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=10s)** — Depression is a chemical imbalance that you need to fix with SSRIs,
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=16s)** — selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=19s)** — Well, this chemical imbalance theory has never been proven.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=23s)** — In fact, in some studies, it shows that people that are depressed
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=27s)** — have normal serotonin or even higher amounts of serotonin.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=32s)** — In your nervous system, you have all these different hormonal-like communications.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=37s)** — One of them is serotonin.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=38s)** — And serotonin does have an effect over your mood,
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=42s)** — just like dopamine has an effect of motivating you.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=45s)** — But what an SSRI does is it blocks the uptake of serotonin.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=51s)** — Let's say, for example, we have a marriage, right?
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=53s)** — We have a husband and a wife, and they're communicating.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=55s)** — And the husband sends a communication over to the wife, but she's wearing earplugs.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=60s)** — That's the SSRI effect, right? You wear earplugs.
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=63s)** — And so then the husband starts shouting.
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=65s)** — Is that going to fix the marriage? No.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=67s)** — Dr. Peter Gosch wrote several books on this topic,
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=71s)** — and he basically said SSRIs are basically placebos.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=76s)** — Hey, well, you know what? At least they're getting some benefit, right?
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=78s)** — Yeah, but what about the side effects?
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=80s)** — Because in his book, he talks about the massive serious side effects of SSRIs.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=85s)** — Sexual dysfunction, no orgasm, decreased libido.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=89s)** — You don't experience emotion anymore, worsening of the depression.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=93s)** — Let's just compare that with something like St. John's Wort.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=95s)** — St. John's Wort doesn't just deal with serotonin.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=98s)** — It deals with dopamine. It's an anti-inflammatory.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=101s)** — It even reduces cortisol.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=103s)** — And what does the medical profession say about St. John's Wort?
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=105s)** — They say, well, you have to be careful not to take it,
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=107s)** — because if you're taking that and a psych drug,
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=110s)** — and you might increase serotonin, St. John's Wort has very little side effects.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=114s)** — And it actually works better than the placebo,
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=117s)** — because it's a natural thing and it does a lot of different things.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=120s)** — And there's some interesting things about Prozac.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=122s)** — Prozac is an SSRI.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=124s)** — When Prozac came on the market in 1988,
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=127s)** — a couple years later, in 1990,
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=129s)** — there was a outbreak of some serious side effects
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=133s)** — where they had a bad batch of tryptophan.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=136s)** — So the FDA decided to ban tryptophan for quite some time.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=142s)** — They lifted the band of tryptophan
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=144s)** — right after the patents for Prozac ran out.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=147s)** — Let's shift gears to our gut.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=150s)** — Your gut makes serotonin.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=152s)** — It also makes something called oxytocin,
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=155s)** — a very powerful hormone that can help people with depression, stress.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=160s)** — Typically, people think about oxytocin as the hormone
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=163s)** — for bonding between a mother and a baby,
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=165s)** — or when a mother is breastfeeding,
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=168s)** — Oxytocin is also there to increase contractions during a pregnancy.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=172s)** — So it has multiple functions.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=173s)** — But just realize that your gut makes oxytocin.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=177s)** — And there is a highway between your gut and your brain.
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=182s)** — It's called the vagus nerve.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=183s)** — Communication from your gut to your brain is very, very heavy.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=186s)** — It's like 80%.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=187s)** — And then we have 20% of information going from your brain down to the gut.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=192s)** — So your brain is monitoring what's going on in your gut
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=195s)** — and then the rest of your heart and other organs as well.
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=199s)** — That's how your brain monitors the rest of your body through the vagus nerve.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=201s)** — And so if your gut microbes are not doing well,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=204s)** — this alone can create depression.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=207s)** — In fact, when other studies, when you take depressed people
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=209s)** — and you look at their gut microbiome,
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=211s)** — there are some serious missing microbes.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=214s)** — This area of gut microbiome is completely underappreciated
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=219s)** — in the area of mental health.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=221s)** — Also, if you have gut inflammation,
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=223s)** — you're not going to feel good mood-wise.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=225s)** — This is why what you eat is so vitally important with how you feel up here.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=229s)** — And this is all very interesting.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=231s)** — But when you also think about antibiotics,
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=233s)** — one of the big side effects of taking antibiotics is depression.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=238s)** — Because you're now erasing the good bacteria
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=240s)** — that controls your mood chemicals.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=243s)** — It wipes them out overnight.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=245s)** — And then you think, oh yeah, the microbes will start to grow back.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=248s)** — No, a lot of times they don't grow back.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=250s)** — So now you have this imbalance and you wonder why you're depressed.
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=252s)** — In practice, I would ask people, when did you start getting depressed?
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=256s)** — Did you take an antibiotic right before that?
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=260s)** — Many times they would say, yes, how did you know?
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=263s)** — The gut microbiome is a chemical factory.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=265s)** — Good chemicals that will send chemicals up through this nerve,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=268s)** — goes up to your brain and infects your mood.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=270s)** — If you have not seen my other video,
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=273s)** — I'm going to put a link down below,
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=273s)** — but I want to tell you a little bit about this amazing microbe.
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=276s)** — You can buy Elruderi as a microbe in a supplement.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=279s)** — But many times it's not in the potency
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=281s)** — that you really need to create the effect.
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=283s)** — And Dr. William Davis told me about an amazing way
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=286s)** — to cultivate this microbe using all to pasteurize half and half.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=291s)** — And you basically put it in a yogurt maker and for 36 hours
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=294s)** — and then you just take a half a cup a day.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=296s)** — I've been doing this for months and I want to tell you something.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=299s)** — It's a game changer.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=300s)** — The first thing that my wife actually noticed
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=302s)** — is she kept saying, why are you hugging me five times a day?
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=307s)** — What's gotten into you? I said, I don't know.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=309s)** — I just have been consuming this yogurt.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=310s)** — It just makes me very social.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=313s)** — I don't know. It's really wild.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=314s)** — She goes, well, just keep keep taking that yogurt.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=316s)** — I noticed my sleep is better.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=318s)** — My muscle is better because it increases stem cell for your muscles.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=321s)** — It reduces stress.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=323s)** — And if you watch my previous videos on this and you read the comments,
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=326s)** — it'll blow your mind.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=327s)** — How many people are just getting amazing results with this probiotic.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=333s)** — It acts as a natural antibiotic without any side effects that I could perceive.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=338s)** — Another interesting point about L-Rotoroy, where does it come from?
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=342s)** — Well, it's actually in mother's breast milk.
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=346s)** — Breastfeeding is not as common as it was years ago.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=349s)** — And antibiotics are extremely common.
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=353s)** — And so these gut microbes are something that we need to put more attention on.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=357s)** — So I highly recommend that you cultivate this L-Rotoroy.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=359s)** — I will put some information down below of exactly how to do it.
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=364s)** — And then you're going to realize that your depression really had nothing to do with your brain.
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=371s)** — It had everything to do with your gut.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJgti1K5A9g&t=374s)** — Thanks for watching.
