- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=0s)** — I want to talk about how your food actually turns into poop.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=3s)** — When you're eating food, you chew your food. You're starting to break your food down.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=6s)** — All the stuff that you're eating is giving information through your taste buds down lower into the digestive tract.
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=14s)** — And then you also have the stomach that has to get ready to break down the protein.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=18s)** — Let's talk about this valve on the top of the stomach first.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=20s)** — This valve is really important to keep the food in the stomach and from backing up into the esophagus.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=27s)** — Because if that food backs up, you have something called acid reflux or heartburn.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=32s)** — The real problem is the acid that you feel is just in the wrong location.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=35s)** — It's in the esophagus or even a little bit higher when it should be in the stomach.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=39s)** — The big mistake that people make is they start taking antacids,
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=43s)** — not realizing that they're going to start to neutralize acids in the stomach.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=47s)** — And the more you dilute these stomach acids, the less that valve closes tightly.
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=52s)** — Instead, if you have any of these acid regurgitation problems, you should be taking more acid.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=57s)** — It sounds counterintuitive, but it does work.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=60s)** — You can do an episode of vinegar diluted because you don't want to take it straight
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=63s)** — because that's going to irritate your esophagus.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=64s)** — But also you can take a really good remedy called betaine hydrochloride.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=69s)** — And I have done videos on this, but you'd probably take three or four or five right before a meal.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=73s)** — You're not actually taking hydrochloric acid.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=75s)** — You're taking something that turns into hydrochloric acid.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=79s)** — And to really understand that a little bit deeper,
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=80s)** — the stomach acid should be between one and three.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=83s)** — That is like battery acid.
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=85s)** — That's super acidic.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=87s)** — As we age, the acid dilutes and gets weaker.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=90s)** — By the time you're 50, your stomach acid is 50% of what it was when you were 20.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=95s)** — If that pH is not super acid, then we don't really absorb minerals as well as we should.
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=102s)** — In that situation, we have too much bacteria in the small intestine.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=106s)** — 90% of all the digestion occurs in the small intestine.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=109s)** — This is where you can also get leaky gut.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=112s)** — And leaky gut can occur if you eat a lot of things that are damaging, especially in the areas of grains.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=117s)** — Gluten can really create problems with that.
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=120s)** — Junk food, refined sugar, seed oils, all of these things can actually create leaky gut.
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=125s)** — And then we have enzymes within the small intestine that are helping you digest.
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=129s)** — Right at the point where the stomach releases its juices into the small intestine,
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=134s)** — pancreas also has to release something to neutralize all that stomach acid
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=138s)** — or else it's going to burn a hole in your small intestine.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=140s)** — How do you know that you don't have enough acid in your stomach?
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=143s)** — Indigestion. So you eat food and it's just like, wow, it's just not digesting.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=147s)** — It's kind of sitting there telling your pancreas to get ready, start to produce enzymes.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=152s)** — You have to then associate that with what enzymes going to be released
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=154s)** — because you have enzymes for protein, carbs, fats.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=158s)** — Information is sent down to the liver and the gallbladder to prepare to digest
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=161s)** — because we have the bile salts that are involved with that.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=165s)** — One tip on digestion is the worse off your digestion is the less food you should be eating.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=171s)** — But then we also have bile. Bile is not made by your gallbladder.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=174s)** — The bile is made by your liver. And so the liver makes the bile.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=178s)** — It goes down a little tube and then it goes right into the gallbladder
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=181s)** — and it just gets concentrated to help you break down fats.
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=185s)** — So here we have the fat, okay, and here we have bile. It's a detergent.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=189s)** — So we're going to pour it into the fat, shake it around a little bit.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=192s)** — It helps you break down fat so you can extract the fat nutrients.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=196s)** — Bile salts also kill off pathogens, bad bacteria in the small intestine.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=202s)** — Your microbes actually make bile salts as well.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=204s)** — When you become deficient in bile, you start getting bloating, burping, belching.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=209s)** — Your vision becomes a problem. And something else happens too.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=212s)** — Gallstones. If you're eating more cholesterol, bile salts will help kind of get rid of that.
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=216s)** — The specific one I would recommend is called Tudka.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=218s)** — It's a very specialized type of bile salt that you take on an empty stomach.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=223s)** — What these bile supplements do is they start to unclog the dam and just allow it to drain properly.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=229s)** — It gives you a lot of relief.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=230s)** — Let me just move right down to the large intestine.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=232s)** — This is where something gets digested. You have trillions and trillions of microbes in your large intestine
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=237s)** — that are helping you break down this fiber through an interesting process of fermentation.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=243s)** — Feeding the microbes fiber and then that's being converted into a type of fatty acid.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=249s)** — Which then feed the colon cells.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=251s)** — These trillions of microbes do so many wonderful things for you.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=255s)** — They give you 80% of your immune system.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=257s)** — They help you make neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=261s)** — Whatever is going on in your microbes down here is going to go on up here.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=264s)** — When you eat food, it has to go through this entire assembly line of things that happen to the point where it ends up as poop.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=271s)** — Poop is like mostly water. The reason why it's brown is because of the pigment in the red blood cells that ends up in your stool.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=278s)** — And the smell of your poop, it's usually some gas from bacteria.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=282s)** — And so it has a certain smell to it, but it can smell even worse at certain times depending on what's happening in your digestion
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=288s)** — or a lack thereof.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=289s)** — When you look at your poop, you can get a lot of clues on what's going on.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=292s)** — I'm just going to cover some general things.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=296s)** — Constipation, diarrhea, and that relates to missing microbes.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=299s)** — When you get an antibiotic, people might tell you that those microbes will come back eventually.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=304s)** — That's false information.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=305s)** — And just think about how many antibiotics we take.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=307s)** — Then there's also something else that acts like an antibiotic, Roundup Ready.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=311s)** — Roundup Ready has a chemical in it called glyphosate.
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=314s)** — Glyphosate is an herbicide, but they also have a patent on it acting as an antibiotic because it kills off your microbes.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=320s)** — Even things that are non-GMO like wheat are loaded with glyphosate.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=325s)** — Three times more than genetically modified foods like soybeans and corn, things like that.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=330s)** — One safe way to avoid glyphosate is just to avoid anything connected with grains and start eating more organic foods
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=337s)** — because the glyphosate can really mess with your microbes.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=341s)** — Eating fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi is really important, but also raw milk cheese is a really good one.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=347s)** — I also did a video on how to make your own probiotic from a microbe called L-Ruderide.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=355s)** — It increases something called oxytocin.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=358s)** — It makes you more social. It helps reduce stress. It helps your sleep.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=362s)** — Another really important tip is to do intermittent fasting because if you're eating too much and you're cramming all this food constantly,
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=371s)** — the poor digestive system never has a chance to clean out.
- **[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=374s)** — Another thing that I think a lot of people are doing incorrectly is drinking these smoothies with kale and banana and pineapple.
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=383s)** — And you just start drinking those in the morning.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=385s)** — Well again, if you have leaky gut or inflammation, you're just going to create more bloating and inflammation because you're dumping too much fiber down there.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=392s)** — Of course, I used to recommend it and for some people they would thrive on it because they needed that.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=397s)** — But it's not a good overall recommendation for everyone.
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=400s)** — 90% of chronic disease is coming from your food and most medications are treating the side effects of bad food.
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQKQ7pa5_ug&t=409s)** — Thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next video.
