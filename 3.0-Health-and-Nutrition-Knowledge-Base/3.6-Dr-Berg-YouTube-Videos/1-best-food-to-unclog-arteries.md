- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=0s)** — The number one best food in the world that can help unclog your arteries,
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=4s)** — prevent a heart attack and a stroke.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=6s)** — This is better than aspirin.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=9s)** — Aspirin has been around for 4,000 years.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=10s)** — And I don't know if you can see it, but there's a tiny little over-the-counter
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=13s)** — pill that's used for pain, fever.
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=16s)** — And yes, aspirin has saved a lot of lives.
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=18s)** — Hundreds of thousands of people over the years have been helped by aspirin.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=22s)** — Before 2022, a lot more people were taking aspirin.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=25s)** — And I think it was recommended for everyone over the age of 60 to take a
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=29s)** — aspirin every day to prevent heart attacks and stroke.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=32s)** — But then a report after 2022 said, no, not everyone should take this because
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=37s)** — there's some slight minor complications like bleeding ulcers, bleeding in the
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=42s)** — brain.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=42s)** — Aspirin does come with a package.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=44s)** — It can cause side effects and it's not for everyone.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=46s)** — The reason why a lot of people take aspirin to help prevent a heart
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=49s)** — attack is because it thins the blood.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=51s)** — What I mean by thinning the blood is it reduces the formation of a clot.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=56s)** — 80% of all heart attacks and strokes come from a clot, not the blockage of
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=64s)** — cholesterol building up and forming a plaque.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=67s)** — And just as a side note, almost 50% of heart attacks occur between 6 a.m.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=72s)** — and 12 noon.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=73s)** — And my theory about that is you have higher levels of cortisol in the
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=77s)** — morning and both cortisol and adrenaline can increase clotting and
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=82s)** — increase your chance of getting a heart attack or stroke.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=84s)** — This is why you have something called the broken heart syndrome, where a loss
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=88s)** — of a loved one can increase your chance of getting a heart attack and a
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=92s)** — stroke by like 2000%.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=94s)** — Let me simply explain what aspirin does.
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=96s)** — In your blood, okay, you have these arteries, right?
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=100s)** — And you have red blood cells that travel through the arteries.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=103s)** — They carry oxygen.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=105s)** — You also have white blood cells, your immune cells, but you also have
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=108s)** — these little things called platelets that are attracted and respond to
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=114s)** — injury.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=114s)** — In other words, if these were platelets and they're responding to an injury,
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=118s)** — they would start to connect and form a clot.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=121s)** — Some people take this other drug called warfarin, which blocks vitamin K1.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=126s)** — It prevents that superglue from forming, keeping the blood thinner.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=131s)** — So you can provide a clot.
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=132s)** — What else could do the same thing, but with less side effects,
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=136s)** — if any side effects.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=138s)** — And before I talk about the actual food that will do this, let's talk
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=141s)** — about the active ingredient in that food that does the magic of preventing
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=146s)** — this clot formation.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=147s)** — And that compound is omega-3 fatty acid.
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=151s)** — Now, when I say omega-3, you might think of fish oils, right?
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=154s)** — And that's true.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=155s)** — It's in fish oils, but it's going to be a little more specific than just
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=159s)** — fish oils in general.
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=160s)** — In omega-3, you have two things.
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=162s)** — You have EPA and you have DHA.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=165s)** — The real key factor is the EPA part of that omega-3 fatty acid.
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=171s)** — How does it compare to aspirin, for example?
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=174s)** — Well, in this study, they showed that EPA worked to decrease clotting
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=178s)** — comparable to low dose aspirin.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=181s)** — EPA has the ability to stabilize vulnerable arterial placking by
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=186s)** — decreasing inflammation.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=188s)** — And when you decrease inflammation, you also reduce the chance of rupture
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=192s)** — and having some plaque break off and then float through your artery.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=196s)** — There's also another study.
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=197s)** — 2019 patients were taking EPA, which is the omega-3 fatty acid, and they
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=202s)** — had significant decrease in plaque, decrease inflammation and decrease
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=206s)** — cardiovascular events by 25%.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=208s)** — What's even more interesting is EPA has another effect that goes beyond
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=214s)** — anti-clotting and it has an effect on your mood.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=218s)** — It has the effect of reducing cortisol and adrenaline.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=222s)** — Remember I talked about that?
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=223s)** — So we have this additional benefit, which could also prevent the
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=226s)** — clotting formation.
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=227s)** — How does EPA work compared to aspirin and warfarin, which are blood thinners?
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=233s)** — Instead of making super glue, you'll get platelets that float around,
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=237s)** — but they're not as sticky.
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=238s)** — The omega-3 fatty acid EPA replaces a key ingredient.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=243s)** — So the super glue can't even be formed in the first place.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=247s)** — Why do I like that approach so much?
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=249s)** — It's because there's no side effects.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=251s)** — Aspirin and warfarin have side effects, but EPA really doesn't.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=255s)** — If we look at the best food that has EPA, you do have salmon, mackerel,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=260s)** — you have any of the fatty fish.
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=261s)** — You also have fish oil and all of those have plenty of EPA, but there's
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=266s)** — one additional food that has some extra benefits to take this to the
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=270s)** — next level and that would be cod liver oil as well as cod liver.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=275s)** — But either cod liver oil or cod liver will give you EPA, but it also
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=280s)** — gives you two additional factors that can, like I said before, take
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=284s)** — to the next level.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=285s)** — Vitamin A and vitamin D.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=287s)** — Vitamin A, and I'm talking about the active form called retinol.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=289s)** — It helps to repair the internal skin of the body, the sinuses,
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=293s)** — the colon, the lungs, the inside of the arteries.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=296s)** — Vitamin A has potent anti-inflammatory effects.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=299s)** — It can also help decrease atherosclerotic placking in animal studies.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=303s)** — But adding vitamin D in there takes it to the next level.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=307s)** — In one study out of a thousand compounds, vitamin D was the most
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=311s)** — effective to prevent damage to the internal layer of your arteries.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=317s)** — And this is why a lot of people take it for high blood pressure, because
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=320s)** — it increases nitric oxide through that inside layer called the endothelial layer.
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=324s)** — Vitamin D decreases the stiffness of the arteries.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=327s)** — It's a potent anti-inflammatory.
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=329s)** — It helps to stabilize placking.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=330s)** — So the placking doesn't plug up an artery.
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=333s)** — It also has been known to help prevent rupturing and decrease
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=338s)** — arterial calcification with the help of vitamin K2.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=341s)** — So the number one best food for unclogging your arteries or
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=347s)** — maintaining the health of the arteries to prevent a heart attack or stroke
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=351s)** — is, colubr oil or cod liver.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=355s)** — And again, you can buy it in a can.
- **[05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=356s)** — Make sure it's while caught.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=357s)** — Thanks so much for watching.
- **[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELokmLIus-Q&t=358s)** — And I will see you in the next video.
