- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about the number one vitamin that controls your mental health.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=3s)** — Thinking is a good thing, right? I mean, that's a very positive thing.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=7s)** — But overthinking, especially too long, especially when you're trying to go to bed at night,
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=12s)** — can prevent you from sleeping.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=13s)** — When your thoughts dominate your mind and you can't turn it off
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=17s)** — because you're solving the problems of the world, it becomes a problem,
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=20s)** — which will also then trigger cortisol, which is more stress.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=24s)** — Thinking about stress will activate your physical hormones
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=28s)** — that will put your body into a stress state.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=31s)** — So the question is, are the hormones causing you to do that?
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=34s)** — Or is it your mind causing the hormones to be activated?
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=36s)** — Well, I think both can affect each other.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=38s)** — But a lot of times people are stuck in this loop, thinking and thinking.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=42s)** — They're very, very focused on a certain problem or a certain thought
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=46s)** — that they can't seem to unfixate their attention off that one thing.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=51s)** — And they end up, you know, looking at different scenarios,
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=54s)** — different ways of solving something, speculating.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=57s)** — Sometimes creating stress that's not even there,
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=60s)** — which in itself is like the definition of a problem.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=62s)** — It's an unresolved thing.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=64s)** — And then you get into this paralysis of analysis.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=67s)** — Another name for that is you're just stuck in your head.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=69s)** — The reason I'm bringing this up is that that would be the definition of anxiety, worry, feeling nervous.
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=75s)** — And I want to talk about the nutritional imbalance involved in this.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=79s)** — There is a major deficiency of a certain nutrient
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=82s)** — that can cause you to obsessively think and kind of be too stuck in your head.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=88s)** — And unfortunately, one of the ways that people address this is they're put on usually in SSRI.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=94s)** — That's a fancy name for a drug that blocks the reabsorption of serotonin.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=100s)** — So it basically kind of keeps the serotonin you have in your body so it doesn't go away.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=106s)** — But it comes with a big package.
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=109s)** — And the package is a lot of side effects, as well as the downgrade.
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=112s)** — of the receptor for serotonin.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=114s)** — So now you're extremely deficient in serotonin.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=117s)** — Where before you were deficient, but now it's like extremely low.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=121s)** — And one of the big symptoms of low serotonin is this obsessive solving problems and thinking all the time.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=127s)** — With the inability to unfixate your mind about a certain problem.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=131s)** — Of course, with this medication. Oh wow, it affects your other neurotransmitters too, like dopamine.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=136s)** — One of the big side effects from SSRIs.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=140s)** — It's called SSRI zombie syndrome.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=144s)** — Because you lose your emotions.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=147s)** — You feel numb to the world.
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=149s)** — You start to lose your ability to get any pleasure from sex.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=152s)** — Now, if you've been on this medication and you have that side effect.
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=156s)** — I do have a solution I'm going to talk about.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=158s)** — But I just wanted to mention if you're thinking about taking this medication, you have to be very aware of the terrible side effects that come along with it.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=165s)** — So that particular symptom is a very severe deficiency of serotonin and dopamine.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=172s)** — And so what Big Pharma has done is they have a whole bunch of other medications that manipulate other neurotransmitters in certain ways.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=178s)** — So there's several things that decrease serotonin.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=181s)** — Drugs, chronic stress, junk food, lack of sun can also create lowered amounts of dopamine.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=188s)** — But the big thing that will deplete your dopamine is not having enough vitamin D.
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=192s)** — Of course, vitamin D comes from the sun.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=194s)** — This is why during the winter months so many people get the blues because of a lack of vitamin D.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=200s)** — But now you know why. Because vitamin D helps serotonin to work.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=202s)** — And so if you're really deficient in vitamin D, you're not only going to get anxiety, it's going to drop down to depression as well.
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=209s)** — In fact, there's an interesting study that shows that vitamin D will create the exact same effects as a medication for depression, but of course without the side effects.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=220s)** — And what's missing in this mysterious puzzle is having all the microbiome.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=225s)** — Because if you take an antibiotic and all of a sudden you get depressed, now you know why.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=231s)** — Because there are certain microbes that help increase serotonin way more than others.
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=236s)** — And those microbes are very sensitive to broad spectrum antibiotics.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=243s)** — And a lot of times they'll kill them off and they never come back.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=245s)** — And now this person is stuck in a state of stress and they don't even realize they don't connect the dots.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=251s)** — Instead they go for the medication and that makes it worse.
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=254s)** — So there's two things I'm going to highly recommend.
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=256s)** — You need to get on vitamin D immediately.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=258s)** — And I'm not talking about a small amount.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=260s)** — I'm talking about at least 10,000 or more of vitamin D3 every single day.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=265s)** — But there's something else that's equally as important.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=268s)** — Making sure that you have the right microbiome, especially the ones that are involved in serotonin.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=275s)** — And the microbe that affects serotonin the most out of all the other ones.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=280s)** — That's virtually non-existent in 96% of the population because of an antibiotic they had long ago.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=287s)** — Is called Elruderi.
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=289s)** — Before you take Elruderi, I'm going to recommend that you not take it as a probiotic.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=295s)** — I recommend instead you take that microbe from a supplement and you make your own probiotic.
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=300s)** — That will allow you to get the concentrations you're going to need to really fix this problem.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=305s)** — Because this microbe not only helps you with anxiety, but it will also increase oxytocin.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=311s)** — That will greatly help reduce cortisol.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=315s)** — And this is the antidote to what we talked about before.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=318s)** — If you were on an SSRI and now you're pretty much flatlined.
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=323s)** — You don't experience pleasure anymore.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=325s)** — You can reestablish those feelings consuming it in a yogurt like form over a period of time.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=331s)** — And I have this information in other videos because it's so important.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=334s)** — And if you haven't seen this video, it'll show you how to make that culture with that microbe.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=341s)** — And I'll put it up right here.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecu697VQopI&t=342s)** — And I will also put it down in the description.
