- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=0s)** — The most common sign of a leaky gut is bloating.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=5s)** — In your gut, you have these little tiny upside down roots.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=9s)** — When you start to develop a leaky gut, you're getting this crevice or hole
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=13s)** — between these little hair-like projections where all sorts of things can travel through
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=18s)** — without getting the stamp of approval from your immune system.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=21s)** — Let's say, for example, you ate something with egg and some of that protein
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=26s)** — leaks down and gets through the intestine. Your immune cells are going to go crazy
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=32s)** — because they're going to think this is a virus or a bacteria or some type of pathogen.
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=37s)** — And so what it's going to do, it's going to tag it.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=40s)** — So the next time you eat peanuts, all of a sudden you have this immune reaction.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=44s)** — And you're like, wait a second, I didn't think I was allergic to peanuts.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=47s)** — The same thing will happen with eggs, protein, or anything.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=50s)** — So here you are all of a sudden allergic to all these different foods and you don't know why.
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=55s)** — And this generates a lot of inflammation and joint pain.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=59s)** — It's going to also show up on a lot of different types of skin reactions.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=64s)** — Psoriasis, dermatitis. You may even notice headaches
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=67s)** — because you have this connection between the gut and your brain.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=72s)** — But the most damaging thing that a leaky gut will do,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=76s)** — it can set you up for an autoimmune disease.
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=79s)** — Things like Hashimoto's, which is a thyroid autoimmune condition
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=83s)** — where your own immune system is attacking your own tissues.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=87s)** — But now the big question is, what causes a leaky gut?
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=91s)** — If we can dig down into that, then we can get rid of the bloating
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=95s)** — and all the other symptoms associated with it.
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=98s)** — The seven most common causes of a leaky gut. I'm going to start with number seven.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=103s)** — Gluten. Okay, gluten is in grains.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=105s)** — The only protein that we as humans cannot digest.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=108s)** — And many people might have an allergy to it or they might just have an intolerance to it.
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=113s)** — Now, the next thing that can cause leaky gut is sugar.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=117s)** — Consuming a lot of sugar creates like a rusting effect throughout the entire body.
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=121s)** — Number five, fiber.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=124s)** — Fiber is considered something that's beneficial to our guts.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=127s)** — And it is because it feeds our microbes.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=130s)** — But the problem is if you have leaky gut, now when you consume that fiber,
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=134s)** — you're going to have more bloating because we have a disruption
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=138s)** — of all the microbes in your gut.
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=141s)** — And they can just create a lot of gas for you.
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=144s)** — All right, number four, lectins in beans, especially.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=148s)** — It's also in grain fed dairy from cows that were fed grains.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=154s)** — If it says grass fed, you're good.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=155s)** — If it doesn't say grass fed, assume it's grain fed.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=159s)** — Number three, certain raw vegetables like broccoli.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=163s)** — It could be cauliflower. It could be cabbage.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=165s)** — Number two, seed oils.
- **[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=167s)** — I'm talking about corn oil, canola oil.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=170s)** — And these foods are highly inflammatory and they definitely will create leakiness in your gut.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=174s)** — Number one, a vitamin D deficiency.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=177s)** — Regardless of whether you're getting rid of gluten, you know,
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=180s)** — or going carnivore because you can't handle the fiber for a couple of months,
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=184s)** — you need to take good amounts of vitamin D to fully heal your gut.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=189s)** — Now, either get a lot of sun without becoming burned
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=192s)** — or start taking at least 20,000 IUs of vitamin D3 every single day.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=198s)** — Now, this will start you on the road to healing the gut,
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=201s)** — but there's some other things you need to be aware of as well.
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=204s)** — And that would be glutamine.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=206s)** — Glutamine is most important for the gut.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=208s)** — And the food that's the highest in glutamine is red meat.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=212s)** — Another food that's high in glutamine is cabbage.
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=215s)** — You can get it in sauerkraut.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=218s)** — Another food that's high in glutamine is bone broth.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=220s)** — Eggs.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=221s)** — Kefir.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=222s)** — Another thing to think about is zinc.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=225s)** — You know, oysters have the most zinc, but any type of shellfish or seafood,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=229s)** — you can also do sea kelp as well.
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=231s)** — And the last most important thing you can do is to give your digestive system
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=238s)** — a chance to rest and repair.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=240s)** — And this is called fasting.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=242s)** — That right there will probably be the most important thing to do
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=245s)** — to really turning in this situation around.
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quo5bOpK4GA&t=248s)** — And I wish someone told me what I'm telling you right now.
