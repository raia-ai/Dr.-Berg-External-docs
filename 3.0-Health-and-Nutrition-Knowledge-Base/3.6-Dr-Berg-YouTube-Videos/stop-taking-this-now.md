- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=0s)** — You never want to take iron supplements. Iron is the most toxic mineral that you can consume.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=6s)** — And so if you are unknowingly taking and being exposed to too much iron over time,
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=10s)** — your organs are going to start to accumulate iron. Your tissues are going to get iron overload.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=15s)** — Even certain people have a genetic problem where they accumulate too much iron and they cannot get
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=20s)** — rid of it, which is very dangerous. You might not even be aware of how much iron is in your
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=26s)** — I mean, this is really important because you might not even be aware of how you are getting
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=30s)** — exposed to iron from all sorts of strange places. Let me just kind of cover all the risk factors
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=37s)** — if you have iron overload. Number one, cancer, especially colorectal. Number two,
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=42s)** — liver disease. I am talking about scar tissue, inflammation of the liver, which leads to cirrhosis.
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=47s)** — Heart disease, because if you think about iron, think about rust. It rusts the inside of your
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=52s)** — body if you have too much. Low testosterone, low libido, diabetes, chronic fatigue syndrome,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=58s)** — infertility, neural degeneration, and a wide range of inflammatory diseases. You know,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=64s)** — I did a video on iron deficiency being the most common mineral deficiency. At the same time,
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=69s)** — it is the most dangerous if you are getting too much. A toxic amount of iron is the most
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=77s)** — diagnosed, overlooked condition in relationship to all the vitamins and minerals. And so,
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=83s)** — let's just cover the common ways that you get iron that you might not even be aware of.
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=88s)** — One way that people are being overloaded is with their supplements, especially the one-a-days.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=93s)** — I do not recommend getting a one-a-day supplement with iron. And you do not absorb
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=98s)** — much, which means a lot of it accumulates and sits around in your digestive tract,
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=104s)** — which means that it is time to cause constipation, nausea, diarrhea, bloating,
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=111s)** — irritation in the colon. You really only absorb like 10% of it, and the rest is kind of
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=116s)** — irritates the digestive tract. The type of iron that most people are taking through
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=122s)** — supplements is the type that will feed pathogens in your digestive tract. Pathogens love to eat
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=132s)** — and you can very easily get an overgrowth of pathogens by giving them too much of the iron
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=138s)** — food. The heme iron in red meat and even in fish get absorbed a lot more, at least 35%
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=146s)** — absorption, and it goes right into the blood, which means there is very little free iron that
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=152s)** — is left in the digestive tract. Plus, in red meat you have a lot of other nutrients
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=156s)** — like vitamin B2, B3, B1, B12, zinc, selenium, and high quality protein, which can then act to
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=164s)** — help balance out iron as compared to just like taking a supplement with higher amounts of iron.
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=170s)** — Let me just first touch on this genetic problem with iron. This is not as rare as you might
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=175s)** — think, and what is interesting in that condition is the person usually has way too much iron
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=180s)** — in their body, but at the same time they are deficient. And that is really the theme of this
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=186s)** — video. When people have too much iron or they have not enough iron, they really have a iron
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=192s)** — dysfunction. It's not as simple as just taking more iron and solving the problem. Beyond the
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=198s)** — one a day supplement, you also have iron supplements, which I'm... I highly recommend you
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=202s)** — never take those. Again, get your iron from actual food. If you're menstruating, for example,
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=206s)** — and you're losing blood, eat more red meat, or take grass-fed liver pills. When you consume
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=211s)** — bread or pasta in the U.S., it is so heavy with iron, it's going to sit in your gut. You're
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=217s)** — going to feel so bloated because the iron is messing with your microbes and it's irritating
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=221s)** — your gut because it's not absorbed that well. But the grains itself don't help. Just look on
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=226s)** — the back of the label with every junk food that you would eat. They have iron added,
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=230s)** — but you might not even read it as iron. I'm just going to give you three different types of
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=244s)** — iron. Supplements, fortification, cast iron pots. When you cook with cast iron,
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=250s)** — you're leaching out a lot of the wrong type of iron. If you drink a lot of alcohol,
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=255s)** — your liver is going to get damaged. And if you have any liver damage at all,
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=260s)** — that alone can cause you to accumulate iron. The biggest way that most people have
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=265s)** — functional iron is a lack of copper. Copper is more higher level and helps control iron.
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=274s)** — There are many, many different enzymes that are dependent on copper that relate directly to the
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=281s)** — control of iron. The first enzyme with copper converts iron to a form that is less
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=290s)** — accumulative in your body. It changes this toxic iron into something that's safer.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=295s)** — Copper also allows you to transport iron through the body. If you don't have copper,
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=301s)** — you can't transport iron effectively, so you accumulate iron. Copper is involved in a very
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=306s)** — powerful antioxidant to reduce oxidation that comes from iron. When you combine iron
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=314s)** — with something in the body called hydrogen peroxide, which your body makes, certain cells
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=319s)** — you form one of the most deadly free radicals in existence. It creates the most damage in the
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=323s)** — body and it comes from hydrogen peroxide and iron. Copper helps reduce this oxidative
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=330s)** — stress, this rusting out in the body. Copper is necessary to make
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=335s)** — heme. This is the protein that allows iron to carry oxygen. You're saying,
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=340s)** — well, wait a second, I don't think I'm deficient in copper. I want to give you
- **[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=343s)** — some data on that too, because you might be deficient in copper. I'm not telling you to
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=347s)** — take a copper supplement because just as we have copper deficiencies, there's also a copper
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=352s)** — toxicity problem as well. Let me just quickly go down the list of things that really create a
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=357s)** — copper deficiency. One is glyphosate. The chemical, roundup ready, binds more to the
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=362s)** — copper than any other mineral in the ground. If you're eating any food with that glyphosate,
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=368s)** — boy, you are not getting any copper at all. A lot of the farming methods now just completely
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=373s)** — destroy the soil. So you're not getting these trace minerals, especially copper.
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=377s)** — Certain antibiotics work by depleting copper. So that's another way to become copper deficient.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=382s)** — High fructose corn syrup blocks copper absorption big time. When you consume any of the cereals
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=390s)** — or the breads with the wheat products, that can bind up the copper as well. The point I'm
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=396s)** — trying to bring to your awareness is that iron deficiency anemia is really iron dysfunctional
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=402s)** — which many times is related to a mere copper deficiency. And so the best foods for copper are
- **[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=412s)** — oysters, shellfish, organ meats. Like I said in the beginning, never take iron supplements.
- **[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=419s)** — Get your iron from actual food, animal food. Don't forget the copper as well because many
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=425s)** — people have a problem with iron simply because they're deficient in copper. And if you want
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZB84A--178&t=429s)** — a little more information about copper, you should check out this video right here.
