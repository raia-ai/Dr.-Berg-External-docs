- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=6s)** — mind. Now I went through a lot of training on the body anatomy physiology. When we talked about fascia
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=13s)** — it was this extra passive tissue you know like bubble wrap that just packs certain things.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=19s)** — Fascia is the matrix or the material that surrounds every muscle in the body.
- **[00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=24s)** — Like let me just give you an example. If we take this weight for example and I start lifting it
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=29s)** — like this right for about I don't know 20 times. I'm going to get tired right. I'm using a lot of
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=38s)** — energy when I'm doing this. Now if we attach some fascial tissue to the weight okay and do
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=46s)** — that. I'm still lifting the weight but I'm using a lot less energy because I'm using
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=52s)** — the free energy from the elastic band that gives you a lot of transfer of energy. Running,
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=59s)** — jumping etc is not just about contraction and relaxation of muscles. It's about the
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=65s)** — loading of the tendons and ligaments in fascia and then releasing it. Fascia gives you your
- **[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=71s)** — posture. I mean you ever see people when they get older like some people literally are
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=76s)** — looking straight down when they're walking and that could have been totally prevented if they
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=80s)** — understood how to keep the fascia healthy and repair it. Which I'm going to tell you at the
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=86s)** — end of this video. Fascia also gives you your body shape. Fascia also has similar properties
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=92s)** — to liquid crystals in those like digital TVs. It has these repeating patterns of similar
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=100s)** — type shapes that have the ability to change and adapt to the environment. The little cells
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=107s)** — that make fascia or collagen are called fibroblasts. And these little cells are like
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=115s)** — little spiders that can migrate. They can move through your body and you have billions of
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=120s)** — them all over the place. And they're basically laying down this it's called ground substance
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=126s)** — to allow for lubrication and movement. And the next one is they are highly involved with
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=131s)** — This is why our fascia can be sore as in fibromyalgia and plantar fasciitis. And over time that injury becomes an
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=142s)** — adhesion. So this is why myofascial release and other techniques in massage and trigger
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=148s)** — point therapy are all really important especially if you had injuries. Now when you stop moving
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=155s)** — the collagen is going to get sticky. It's going to get stiff and the fascia is going to fuse
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=160s)** — together and stiffen. And when you start moving that tissue it's not going to let you move. It's
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=166s)** — going to be very restricted. And maybe in your mind you might think, oh wow I have a tight
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=171s)** — muscle. No you don't. You have tight fascia. And fascia is also connected from head to toe.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=179s)** — And so knowing this really helped me understand why certain techniques worked when I was in practice.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=186s)** — For example, when people would come in and have injuries on their tailbone, I found the best
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=192s)** — relief I can give them is by working on the back of the neck. The occiput. Releasing the
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=198s)** — occiput seems to help tailbone injuries. Now why would that work? Because of fascia. It's all
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=204s)** — connected. I'm basically taking this fascia and making it longer so there's more space.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=211s)** — Another example would be people that had problems with their shoulder. They couldn't
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=214s)** — elevate the shoulder. I would have them lay face down and if they had a restriction on the left
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=219s)** — shoulder, I would work on the right calf and Achilles tendon. And that always seemed to open
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=226s)** — up the shoulder. Why is that? Because the fascia on the right lower part of your body is
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=232s)** — connected to the left shoulder. Another example would be people that had right shoulder pain
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=237s)** — through here. I would work on the gallbladder area. Now in the past I would talk about the
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=243s)** — nerve being involved which is probably true. But I think also all the fascia that surround that
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=250s)** — phrenic nerve that go all the way up into the third cervical vertebra through here with all the
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=254s)** — different fascia attachments. So as I loosened this part up, it freed up this part. Fascia is
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=262s)** — extremely innervated by little tiny nerves that allows the body to know where it is in space.
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=267s)** — And this is why the fascia is very important for balance, coordination, and it has this amazing
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=275s)** — ability to be able to change its material properties. It can go from being very rigid
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=283s)** — to very elastic. If you sit all day and don't move at all, the environmental message is
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=290s)** — don't adapt. Just get tight and hold the person in that position. So you see this in
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=295s)** — nursing homes a lot with people in this one position like all day sitting, their body just
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=300s)** — grows like that. It's in communication with your environment unless you get an injury.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=308s)** — In other words, when you start walking or moving, now things have changed because we had
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=313s)** — that injury and now you're guarding a little bit on one side of your body. So the secret to
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=320s)** — fascia has to do with adding dynamic motions from different directions. So it's not just
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=328s)** — the same motion over and over and over again. I remember in my 30s, the only exercise that I
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=334s)** — did... I mean it was just biking over and over and over and over. My psoas muscles,
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=339s)** — which are the hip flexors, became so tight because I was doing that same motion over and
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=344s)** — over again. I'm going to put the videos that I'm personally doing down below but there's many more
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=350s)** — that you can find. I want to give you the general principles of what to do. Another thing
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=355s)** — that I'm adding to this program is high doses of vitamin D3. I'm doing 50,000 I use every
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=362s)** — single day. If you're ever going to do a similar thing with vitamin D, you want to make
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=366s)** — sure you take the cofactors, vitamin K2 and magnesium and zinc and B6. And that way you
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=373s)** — prevent any problems that may come up from taking high doses of vitamin D. And if you
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqGowurcVPs&t=379s)** — want more information about vitamin D and the cofactors, you should watch this video right here.
