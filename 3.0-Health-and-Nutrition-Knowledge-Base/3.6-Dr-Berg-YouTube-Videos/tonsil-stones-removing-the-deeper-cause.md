- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=0s)** — There are so many videos about removing tonsil stones, but I haven't seen any video on how to correct
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=6s)** — the deeper underlying cause of a tonsil stone, because a tonsil stone is really a symptom
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=11s)** — of something else. And I totally understand that tonsil stones can be pretty bad because they
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=16s)** — give you chronic halitosis, like really bad breath. Apparently the microbes that are involved
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=22s)** — produce what's called volatile sulfur compounds. And this is like a sulfur gas,
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=28s)** — kind of like rotten eggs, which is also involved in the smell of like a swamp or a sewage. And
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=35s)** — these microbes are making this gas in the back of your throat, so it can be pretty devastating.
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=40s)** — And the gas is called hydrogen sulfide. And so what you have is you have these microbes in these
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=44s)** — little tiny indentations in the back of your tonsils that are basically creating pus and mucus,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=52s)** — and eventually it turns into this calcium little stone. So let's first just kind of
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=59s)** — set up the tonsils. You have tonsils a little bit higher up in the back of the nasal area,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=64s)** — which you can't really see. And then you have the one that you can see called the palatine
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=67s)** — tonsils. And the word palatine is from the palatine bone, because it's the posterior part or
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=73s)** — the back part of your throat. So basically what a tonsil it is, it's kind of like a lymphatic
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=78s)** — tissue that acts as the first line of the defense against pathogens. So the tonsils are
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=84s)** — there to pick up information from these pathogens and send it to the rest of the immune system.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=90s)** — It's kind of like, okay, body, we have the pathogens in the house, we have to do something
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=94s)** — about it. Start turning up the immune system. So they're kind of like the guard at the front
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=99s)** — door to protect against pathogens going into the lung, as well as in the digestive system.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=107s)** — And a lot of times people have their tonsils removed, right? Problem over. Well,
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=111s)** — when you remove the first line of defense, there could be some complications, possibly,
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=116s)** — not always, but they have found increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections,
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=122s)** — infections of the lung, increased risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma, and also an enhancement
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=129s)** — in susceptibility to developing certain types of autoimmune conditions,
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=134s)** — probably because most of the autoimmune conditions originate in the gut. And so then
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=140s)** — invades it bypasses immigration. Now, as far as the pathogens that this tonsil is exposed to,
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=148s)** — they've calculated that if you look at the difference between viruses and bacteria,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=152s)** — the viruses are roughly about between 50 and 80% of tonsil infections. And the bacteria is
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=161s)** — only between five and 17%. And also remember that antibiotics only work on bacterial infections. So
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=169s)** — if you're automatically taking antibiotic, it's going to be hit or miss because if it's a viral
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=173s)** — thing, it's not going to do anything. The Epstein-Barr virus is notoriously known to
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=179s)** — infect the tonsils. But here's the big picture of the tonsils. You need to be able to
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=184s)** — stimulate and train your immune system to become stronger. And so we're born with an
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=192s)** — innate immune system from our mother, but we develop what's called the acquired immune system
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=198s)** — through training being exposed to certain pathogens. So when they do studies on mice that
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=203s)** — are germ-free and don't have this training system, they don't develop certain parts of
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=209s)** — the immune system later in life. And that can weaken the immune system. And the reason I'm
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=213s)** — bringing this up is because sometimes when you have kids and they have swollen tonsils,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=217s)** — you might immediately start giving them some type of anti-inflammatory ibuprofen or something
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=223s)** — to get rid of the inflammation or the symptom. When in fact, it may be a good idea just to let
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=228s)** — them go through the infection to develop this acquired immunity. This is interesting. And I'm
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=233s)** — going to put the research down below in the description. I found something fascinating in
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=238s)** — relationship to vitamin D deficiencies. There's a significant association between low vitamin D
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=245s)** — and an inflamed tonsil, as in tonsillitis. I did find another study that showed a zinc
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=252s)** — deficiency can also create an inflamed tonsil as well as an iron deficiency. And we do know that
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=258s)** — zinc and vitamin D and also iron influence the immune system. And vitamin D is like seriously
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=265s)** — powerful in helping create antimicrobial effects within your immune system. I found another
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=273s)** — interesting paper and one very specific thing about that paper that's kind of stood out.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=277s)** — One of the risk factors of having tonsil problems is lack of sun exposure. Ding ding ding,
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=287s)** — vitamin D. There's more incidence of inflamed tonsils during the winter versus the summer.
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=294s)** — Here's the problem. It's very difficult to get enough vitamin D from our diet.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=298s)** — And many times if you're thinking about kids and tonsil problems and large tonsil issues,
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=305s)** — first of all they don't get out in the sun as much and many times they don't consume salmon,
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=311s)** — coliver oil, things like that. And if they're drinking soda with high phosphates,
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=317s)** — that alone can deplete the vitamin D. The underlying predisposing factor really is vitamin D
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=324s)** — and probably throw some zinc in there too. And if you have small children, you can even get
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=329s)** — the liquid vitamin D as well. Now another point I want to bring up when I was in practice,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=333s)** — I would have kids come in all the time with these huge tonsils and that affects the breathing and
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=338s)** — creates snoring. And back then I didn't really know about vitamin D but what I did do,
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=344s)** — which was successful, is get them off milk because many times they had a milk allergy and
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=349s)** — they didn't know it. And it could just automatically create enlargement or inflammation
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=354s)** — of your tonsils. Now as far as the amount of vitamin D, as far as a maintenance dose,
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=359s)** — I would recommend 10,000 IUs. If you're trying to therapeutically correct something,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=363s)** — I would increase it to 20, maybe 30,000 IUs. But also make sure you take vitamin K2,
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=370s)** — especially since calcium is involved. And one of the points about calcium is vitamin K2
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=378s)** — removes the calcium from the soft tissues, not just the arteries and the joints. So for
- **[06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=384s)** — every 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3, you want 100 micrograms of vitamin K2. That would be a
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=392s)** — good ratio. Now since we're on the topic of tonsils, I have another video on this which has
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32KS2eeuvY&t=396s)** — been very popular. If you haven't seen this one, check it out. I put it up right here.
