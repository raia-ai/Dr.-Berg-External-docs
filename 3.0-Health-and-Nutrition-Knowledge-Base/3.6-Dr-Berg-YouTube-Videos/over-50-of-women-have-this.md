- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=0s)** — I want to share the best vitamin to help shrink a fibroid. So what is a fibroid?
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=5s)** — Fibroid is a growth, but it's not cancerous. Fibroids are the number one reason why women
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=11s)** — get hysterectomies. Fibroids are very, very common. I saw one reference that 20 to 50% of
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=17s)** — all women before the age of 50 have some type of growth or fibroid or endometriosis. So first,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=25s)** — start with the uterus. What is the uterus? Well, it's part muscle and part gland. You can look at
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=32s)** — the uterus like the soil where the seed or an egg implants and starts growing. And so it's really
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=40s)** — nutrient dense. It's rich. It feeds the egg once it's fertilized. And the uterus has incredible
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=48s)** — regenerative properties. I mean, researchers are now looking at how can they use that
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=53s)** — in different places in the body to help regenerate the tissues. The other thing that's
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=57s)** — fascinating about the uterus is that it has the ability to expand by 500x. And of course,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=64s)** — I shared that information with my wife, Karen, and her reply was, you think I don't know that
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=70s)** — after three kids? So of course, I quickly dropped that conversation. Here's the information
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=74s)** — I stumbled on relating to fibroids. There's been some studies that show that vitamin D
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=80s)** — can help reduce the size of the fibroid. Now, why would vitamin D actually help you shrink a
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=87s)** — fibroid? Vitamin D regulates the genes that control growth. And in one of the papers I found,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=95s)** — the vitamin D receptor in a fibroid are very different versus normal uterus tissue. That
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=104s)** — means that the fibrous tissue is not going to receive as much vitamin D, which means it's
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=109s)** — less controlled over the growth. I mean, if you think about it, vitamin D really isn't a vitamin,
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=115s)** — it's a hormone. When someone's vitamin D deficient, they're a lot more at risk
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=121s)** — of developing fibroids, and the uterus is very hormone sensitive. And so there's an
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=126s)** — enzyme called aromatase that converts androgens to estrogen. And so there's all sorts of
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=135s)** — and even medications that can act as an aromatase inhibitor. And guess what? Vitamin D is a natural
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=141s)** — aromatase inhibitor. Also, vitamin D can create an effect on the fibroid itself. If you have
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=148s)** — enough vitamin D, student tumors and even cancers will start committing suicide. Now,
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=153s)** — that is a normal process when a cell is damaged. But the thing about cancer and tumors,
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=159s)** — the problem with that is that somehow that controlled cell death, where the cell becomes
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=165s)** — damaged and starts committing suicide, and now the cancer cell, the tumor cell just keeps
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=170s)** — growing, growing, growing. But vitamin D can help increase that apoptosis in the fibroid.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=176s)** — Now, I'm going to explain how much vitamin D to take to create this effect. But I just
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=181s)** — wanted to mention a Dr. Bruce Hollis, who basically did a lot of the original research
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=188s)** — and he's a professor and he has over 500 papers, okay, mostly related to vitamin D.
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=195s)** — And in some of his videos, it's very interesting because this is what he said. He said that
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=200s)** — a lot of the positive result type studies in vitamin D are rejected by the top journals.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=208s)** — And he left me with an impression that it's almost as if they don't want people to know
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=214s)** — about this positive vitamin D effect. Now, relating to that, I want to bring up another
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=221s)** — study. It's a quite large study, which is called the Vital Study. So this was a study
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=227s)** — involving 25,000 adults. It's a quite large study. And apparently was no benefit to vitamin
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=235s)** — D or omega-3 in reducing major cardiovascular events or cancer. If we actually read this
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=244s)** — study, there's a couple things about this study that's a little fishy. The analysis of the
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=252s)** — study excluded the first two years of follow-up, which showed significant reduction of cancer.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=262s)** — Number two, if you separate out the people that actually weren't overweight versus the
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=267s)** — overweight and obese people, there was a much lower risk of getting cancer for the people
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=274s)** — that had normal weight. Now, the reason I'm bringing that up is because people that are obese
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=278s)** — or overweight need more vitamin D because vitamin D gets stored in the fat cells. And
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=284s)** — if someone is obese, that vitamin D is going to be diluted. They also admitted some
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=289s)** — limitations. One is there was only one dose of vitamin D per day. You think 10,000? No.
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=296s)** — 2,000 I use. They're calling 2,000 I use high dose vitamin D. Also, there's data to indicate
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=304s)** — that they really did not follow the criteria for a true randomized placebo controlled trial.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=311s)** — They also omitted the information on exposure to sun, how much people were outside versus
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=317s)** — inside. They didn't follow up and assess vitamin D in 94% of the participants. So what
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=325s)** — I do if I had a fibroid, I would take about 50,000 I use of vitamin D. Now, I know what you're
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=333s)** — thinking, boy, that's a lot. That's a toxic amount. What am I going to do about the side
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=338s)** — effects of that, etc. But if you take vitamin K2, you take magnesium, zinc, boron,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=347s)** — vitamin B6. These are all the cofactors that protect you against hypercalcemia,
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=354s)** — too much calcium in the blood. And if you're taking 50,000 I use of vitamin D3 every day,
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=359s)** — the amount of K2 that you would need, I would take about 500 micrograms with that. I would also
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=365s)** — take 800 milligrams of magnesium. Very important. Magnesium will help reduce the calcium
- **[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=371s)** — formation. I would also take 50 milligrams of zinc. And then I would also take vitamin B6
- **[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=378s)** — and boron. And as far as the amounts, whatever is recommended on the bottle. I would
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=383s)** — also get on the ketogenic diet. Why? To reduce my insulin because insulin can actually increase
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=390s)** — the growth of fibroids. And lastly, I would be consuming a good amount of cruciferous
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=396s)** — vegetables to help any other things that can mimic estrogen. Also, I would limit to the
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=403s)** — amount of milk you consume. Milk is used to grow a calf. So there's a lot of growth
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=407s)** — but also the calcium in milk can be another situation that you want to reduce if you're
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=414s)** — taking a lot of vitamin D. And the next video you really need to know about
- **[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=418s)** — is this vitamin D toxicity topic. I don't even believe vitamin D toxicity comes from
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd9JJw6sc8&t=424s)** — the vitamin D. I think it's the lack of cofactors. And for that information,
