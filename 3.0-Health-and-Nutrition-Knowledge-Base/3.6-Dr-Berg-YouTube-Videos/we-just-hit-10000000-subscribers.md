- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=0s)** — You know, I don't even know how to respond to this, but we just hit 10 million subscribers on my
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=8s)** — YouTube channel. I'm just thankful. I appreciate so much all of you watching my videos and the
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=13s)** — wonderful comments. I read most of your comments, by the way. I might not respond to all of them
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=19s)** — because there's many of them, but I read a tremendous amount of your comments. I just
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=22s)** — want to say thank you. We finally did it after all these years. It wasn't easy. I started off,
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=28s)** — I think, in 2008 and it took me two or three or even four years before I got up to 400 subscribers.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=36s)** — I remember at that time I was so excited because I was like, wow, 400 people watching
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=41s)** — my videos or subscribing. This is amazing. I mean, I was thinking about like in a room
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=45s)** — because I normally when I do a seminar, I have like 20 people. But when I think about
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=49s)** — 10 million, it's very intimidating. It's very humbling. And just to give you a little update
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=55s)** — on what I've been up to, I've been doing a deep dive into DNA. And so I may either start another
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=62s)** — YouTube channel specifically on DNA and what all that means with the different gene problems
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=68s)** — that someone might have and make it really simple. Or I may mesh it in with my existing
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=72s)** — channel. So that's coming up. There's just a lot of learning in this area. And to be
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=77s)** — able to explain it simply, you have to understand it. So, and that takes quite a bit of time.
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=82s)** — And the other thing that I'm working on, which I'm very, very excited,
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=86s)** — I decided to start to grow my own ingredients or as many ingredients as I can on my own farm.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=95s)** — That way I can control the quality. I can control the microbiome in the soil,
- **[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=102s)** — the health of the plant. I'm going to video the whole thing. So it's going to be very,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=108s)** — exciting. Let's talk about quality. And really the health of an herb or a plant
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=114s)** — is really all about the microbes in the soil. So in reality, that's what we're going to be
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=119s)** — focusing on mostly. And from that, we'll do a lot of research. We'll have courses on
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=124s)** — gardening and growing and things like that. But I just wanted to create this short video
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=127s)** — and just say thank you from the bottom of my heart. I hope I am helping you and I'm going to
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyLFwe1hiw0&t=137s)** — I value your attention and your time that you spend watching my videos.
