- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=0s)** — Let's talk about the seven foods that destroy your kidneys.
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=3s)** — Your kidneys are simply amazing. Each kidney has about a million little tiny filters.
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=9s)** — They're called nephrons. And they have the ability to selectively get rid of certain bad stuff
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=14s)** — and retain certain good things. And with the two million nephrons you have, you filter out
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=19s)** — 50 gallons of blood every single day. And so these kidneys recycle 99% of all of your blood.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=27s)** — So only a little bit is released. And one of the big problems with your kidney is high blood pressure.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=33s)** — Because if you have chronic high blood pressure, that can really destroy those little tiny filters.
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=38s)** — Another thing that's even more destructive than blood pressure to your kidneys is high levels of
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=44s)** — sugar, as in diabetes. So all the sugar that's in your blood has to go through these little
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=48s)** — tiny filters. And then what happens when it interacts with the filters is it makes those
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=53s)** — little filters smaller. So now it can't filter. So now you're going to be losing sugar and losing
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=59s)** — protein in the urine. A couple simple ways to determine if there is a damage to the kidney is,
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=65s)** — number one, do you have sugar in the urine? And number two, do you have protein in the
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=70s)** — urine? Because if you do, that can mean kidney damage. And also the color of your urine is
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=76s)** — important too, because when the kidneys stop filtering, the color of the urine is no longer
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=80s)** — amber yellow. It can get darker and it can turn actually a lot of different colors. But one of
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=86s)** — the most important things that the kidney does is activate vitamin D. And if there's damage with
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=92s)** — the kidney, you're not going to be able to activate vitamin D. And that could be one reason
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=96s)** — why people are very, very deficient. So we need strong, healthy kidneys to get rid of waste
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=100s)** — and to even retain nutrients. All right, let's start with food number one, instant noodles,
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=106s)** — like ramen noodles. So it is true that these noodles are loaded with sodium, but there's
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=111s)** — something more damaging about these noodles. It's actually a preservative. It's called TBHQ.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=117s)** — This preservative is very toxic to the kidneys. It can actually cause the kidneys
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=121s)** — to work harder, where you actually enlarge your kidney. And it also has the ability,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=126s)** — in some cases, to produce cancer in your kidneys. Now, I just want to bring up sodium
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=130s)** — for a second, because sodium definitely is a problem with blood pressure. When you go to
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=135s)** — the doctor, they might say that you're salt sensitive, so you have to reduce your sodium.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=140s)** — But the question is, do we really need to reduce sodium? Or do we need to increase
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=145s)** — potassium, which is more protective? Because there's just as many problems with too much
- **[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=151s)** — sodium as there is with a deficiency of sodium. There's a condition where a person is drinking
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=156s)** — a lot of water, but not consuming enough salt. And that's called hyponatremia. With that
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=162s)** — condition, you can even create fluid retention in your body, which puts a lot of strain
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=166s)** — on the kidney. And also just drinking more water puts a big strain on the kidney,
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=170s)** — getting rid of all this extra fluid. So when people think, oh yeah, what's good for the
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=174s)** — kidney? Oh, drink a lot of water. Not necessarily. You want to drink when you're
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=178s)** — thirsty. But forcing yourself to drink tons of water without the electrolytes could create
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=182s)** — problems in the kidneys. And anytime you consume salt, always consume sea salt.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=187s)** — All right. Number two, skittles or things like this. And I'm talking about things that
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=194s)** — contain a lot of food dyes. These artificial dyes are very hard on the kidney. The kidney
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=200s)** — has to get rid of them. Now also realize at first, the kidney is going to recycle a lot of
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=204s)** — that dye. And it's going to kind of go through your bloodstream over and over and over
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=207s)** — again. You don't want artificial dyes going through your body like that. All right. Next
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=211s)** — is fried chicken. I'm talking about the fried chicken that you would get at a fast food
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=216s)** — restaurant. You put in seed oils at very high heats. So anytime you heat a protein
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=223s)** — with a carbohydrate, as in all that flour breading, you get something called glycation.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=230s)** — Let me explain what glycation is. Here's some protein. Here's a carbohydrate. And they get
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=236s)** — connected and they bind under high heats. So now this sugar molecule is stuck to the protein.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=242s)** — Now this protein in your body can't work anymore. That's what glycation is. So let's say,
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=247s)** — for example, you took a test for diabetes called A1C. What they're measuring is the
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=251s)** — amount of glucose that's stuck to the protein, your hemoglobin, your protein, your blood.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=258s)** — And it's making that no longer available to do its job. So if you have higher amounts of
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=264s)** — A1C, you have higher amounts of sugar that's connected to your protein to the point where
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=270s)** — you start getting all sorts of complications from diabetes, where things don't work. Because when
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=276s)** — the glucose gets stuck to the hemoglobin or the protein or any protein in your body,
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=280s)** — it clogs everything up, especially in the kidneys. And so when you consume something that's
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=285s)** — fried, what you're going to get is this junk that just clogs everything up. The next one is
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=291s)** — commercial bread. Now the expiration on this was mid-July. Right now, it's September. And look
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=299s)** — at it. It's not even going bad. It's still soft. How can that be? Because it has preservatives
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=306s)** — and it also has something called potassium bromate. Potassium bromate is really harmful on
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=311s)** — the kidneys. In fact, it's banned in a lot of countries, except the U.S. and I think Japan.
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=316s)** — And apparently it's carcinogenic in our bodies, especially with kidney cancer.
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=320s)** — The next one is soda. What's in the soda that's harmful for the kidneys? Phosphoric acid.
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=328s)** — Phosphoric acid is destructive on the kidneys, not just from the phosphoric acid, but from the
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=333s)** — added sugar as well. And by the way, the number one cause of kidney damage is diabetes.
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=339s)** — Now what's diabetes? Diabetes means the person has too much sugar in the blood.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=344s)** — Well, isn't there some sugar in here? Yes, there is. And then also, why do they put the
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=349s)** — phosphoric acid in there? Well, number one, it's cheaper than other types of acid like citric acid.
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=354s)** — It can act as a preservative. It helps retain the carbonation and it's an overall flavor
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=360s)** — enhancer. All right, number six is agave syrup. Agave syrup has been known to be even keto
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=367s)** — friendly, which it's totally bogus because 80% of agave syrup is fructose. Even high fructose
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=376s)** — is a very high fructose. And corn syrup is like 55% fructose. Agave is 80, even in some reports,
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=382s)** — 90% fructose. And yes, fructose is low in the glycemic index, but all the fructose is metabolized
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=388s)** — different in the body. It goes to the liver and it overloads the liver with a lot of stress.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=393s)** — So why is that so damaging? Because the metabolism of fructose is similar to alcohol.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=397s)** — It also creates a lot of problems with insulin resistance, which is the precursor to
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=402s)** — diabetes and then diabetes. And since diabetes is the number one cause of chronic kidney disease,
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=409s)** — then agave nectar is right up there at the very top level of irritating the kidney.
- **[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=414s)** — All right, last one, cereals. Even instant cereals. Why? Not just because of the seed
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=420s)** — oils and the refined sugars and the refined starches, but glyphosate. It's not going to be
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=425s)** — listed as one of the ingredients because legally they don't have to put it on the label, but
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=429s)** — can volunteer using a different name. Bioengineered ingredients. You might see that.
- **[07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=436s)** — That means glyphosate. Now in certain parts of the world where they use a lot of glyphosate
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=442s)** — in agriculture, the workers who work the fields have a much higher risk of chronic kidney
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=448s)** — disease because of the heavy exposure to this glyphosate. The other thing to know is that
- **[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=453s)** — anything GMO like soy, corn, cottonseed is going to have glyphosate in it, but also
- **[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=459s)** — things that are not GMO like oats and wheat because they use glyphosate to dry out these
- **[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=466s)** — grains during the processing of them. And so even though it's not GMO, they're still using
- **[07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=471s)** — them. So we talked about all the foods to avoid. Okay, but now the question is what to
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcRNVf9XU-M&t=476s)** — eat to improve kidney function? And for that information, you should watch this video right here.
