- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=0s)** — So I want to revisit this topic of everyone needs to drink more water. I know last time I did a
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=5s)** — video on this stirred up a lot of opinions on this topic. So before you click off, just please hear
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=12s)** — me out. I will say right up front that I do drink water and I'm not against water. I drink about
- **[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=18s)** — two and a half liters of water every single day. However, there's some really interesting
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=22s)** — information about water because you may think that water hydrates you. It actually doesn't.
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=29s)** — It could even dehydrate you. And I'm primarily talking about drinking excessive amounts of water.
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=35s)** — There's a term for this. It's called water intoxication or water poisoning or over-hydration
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=40s)** — because if you think about it, how does this water get into your cells? Is it a passive thing?
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=46s)** — Does it just kind of go into your cells and start hydrating? No. There are very specific
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=51s)** — proteins that allow this water to go into your cells and with the help of electrolytes. And so
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=58s)** — what happens when you drink a lot of water without electrolytes? You can dilute the body's
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=65s)** — electrolytes, mainly sodium, but other electrolytes as well. And that condition is called
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=72s)** — hyponatremia. And here are the symptoms. Headache, nausea, confusion, irritability,
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=79s)** — muscle cramping, as well as brain swelling. There's even a condition called EAH. That's a
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=86s)** — condition where the person is waterlogged and it's creating a lot of swelling in the brain.
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=90s)** — And that could easily come from just drinking too much water. And this often occurs when
- **[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=96s)** — someone is exercising. And so this really pertains to athletes and people that exercise a
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=101s)** — lot, especially people that do marathons and they're drinking a lot of water. It could be
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=105s)** — quite dangerous. In fact, in the Boston Marathon 2005, at the end of the finish line, they
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=116s)** — had this hyponatremia, which is basically a diluted fluid in your body where you don't have
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=121s)** — enough sodium. Now there's other things that also can cause hyponatremia other than just
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=127s)** — drinking too much water. It could be that you had diarrhea, vomiting, you're just sweating
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=131s)** — too much. Because think about it, like when you sweat, it's really salty. And then also,
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=137s)** — if you're drinking a lot of plain water without salt, you're just going to create
- **[02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=141s)** — a situation where you're going to actually be very deficient in salt. Just as a side note,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=144s)** — the first symptoms of a salt or sodium deficiency is muscle weakness. You feel very, very weak.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=152s)** — And this could easily occur if you're doing some type of sport or exercising and you just
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=157s)** — you feel like your muscles are weaker and weaker. Well, obviously you need more salt.
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=161s)** — And some people that have these sports drinks might not have enough salt or other
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=166s)** — electrolytes in them. Instead, they might have a few electrolytes and a lot of glucose,
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=171s)** — which by the way can tie up a lot of these electrolytes, especially potassium. It kind of
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=175s)** — locks it up. There's another condition where a person is... they have very weak adrenals,
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=180s)** — right? Adrenals are very, very weak and that's called adenosines. And that person
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=185s)** — can't hold sodium. And so that person is very susceptible to having this hyponatremia
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=191s)** — situation. So people that have that condition need to consume a lot of salt just to balance
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=197s)** — out the fluids. Now also when someone drinks alcohol, a lot of beer, you know, I remember one
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=202s)** — time I was in high school and I drank a case of beer, which is very, very dangerous. And of
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=208s)** — course I didn't drink any salt with that. So that created a major imbalance with my electrolytes.
- **[03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=213s)** — And my brain felt like it was going to explode because that's what happens when you
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=218s)** — actually have this hyponatremia is you get swelling in the brain. You also have those that
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=223s)** — a hypothyroid condition. You have people that are on diuretics, which can really throw off your
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=228s)** — electrolytes because it's meant to get rid of this sodium. And the person is usually on a
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=233s)** — low sodium diet. You see, I really think there's more problems with having low sodium than high
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=239s)** — sodium. And by the way, if you do consume a lot of sodium, you can always balance out that
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=245s)** — with more potassium. People who are salt sensitive are really potassium deficient. Infants are also
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=252s)** — susceptible to having this hyponatremia situation. People who are on SSRIs are susceptible as well.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=262s)** — And diabetics are also susceptible to having this situation because of the different fluid
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=266s)** — electrolyte imbalances. And also they have higher sugar and they're going to be peeing out
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=271s)** — more fluid. And so they can easily be dehydrated. So drinking more water is not the
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=276s)** — only cause of this hyponatremia. If the person has diarrhea or is vomiting or is exercising and
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=283s)** — sweating all these salts out or is on certain medications that can be also creating a situation,
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=288s)** — you'd want to advise them to also add sodium and not go crazy with too much water. So if
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=294s)** — you're checked out in this video, check back in because this next thing I want to tell you
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=298s)** — very, very important. There has been deaths occurring from people drinking about six
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=305s)** — liters of water within a three hour period. What is six liters of fluid? That is 1.5 gallons.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=315s)** — I'm sure you've known people who have just guzzled a gallon of water in one sitting
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=321s)** — very quickly. Not smart. When I was in the military, when I would march 17 miles,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=327s)** — we'd drink a tremendous amount of water, but we'd also take salt with that. Typically now,
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=332s)** — at least in the military, when you're training, the most that you're supposed to drink per hour
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=338s)** — is 1 to 1.5 liters of fluid per hour. So you don't want to drink way too much fluid
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=345s)** — too fast, even if you're sweating. Now, of course, on the flip side, if you're susceptible
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=350s)** — to kidney stones, you should be drinking at least two and a half liters of fluid a day,
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=355s)** — even if you're not thirsty. But the point is you do want to pay attention to your thirst
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=360s)** — and drink when you're thirsty and not go crazy with too much. But I think two to two and a
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=366s)** — half liters of fluid is totally reasonable. Of course, if you're doing exercise or doing
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=370s)** — marathons, you really want to make sure you don't create this condition called hyponatremia,
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=376s)** — where you're just guzzling all this water with very little electrolytes. The last point I'm
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=383s)** — making, which is very important, if you're exercising and you're sweating, and you're
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=386s)** — taking a regular electrolyte powder that's not necessarily meant for sports or exercise,
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=393s)** — you might want to either add more sodium to that electrolyte or use some type of sport
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=399s)** — hydration electrolyte with more sodium. Now, because of the censoring and the suppressing
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=404s)** — of the algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lWRnh0GfI&t=410s)** — a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately. So to make sure you have full
