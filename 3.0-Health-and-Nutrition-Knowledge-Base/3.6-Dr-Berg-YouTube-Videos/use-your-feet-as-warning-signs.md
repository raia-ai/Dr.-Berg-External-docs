- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=0s)** — Your feet are a diagnostic window into your health problems. In other words, this right here will
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=6s)** — tell you a lot about early signs of many different problems. At the end of this video, you're going
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=12s)** — to have the ability to understand a lot about what's going on inside your body just by looking
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=17s)** — at your foot or someone else's foot. Right here, we have the heart and we have the foot. And this
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=22s)** — little connection between the heart and the foot is your blood vessels. You have the most
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=28s)** — oxygen starting at the heart and you have the least oxygen starting in your foot. The foot is
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=34s)** — going to receive oxygen and nutrition through tiny little capillaries. If someone has sugar in their
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=39s)** — blood as in diabetes, it's going to show up in your foot first as the earliest sign. I'm going
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=45s)** — to go through a series of indicators that will tell you what's going on in the rest of the
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=50s)** — body. The first topic I want to cover is something called peripheral neuropathy. You might
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=55s)** — start with numbness or even like burning and then it can go into some weird sensations. It
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=62s)** — just feels abnormal. That's because the sensory nerves are breaking down because of mainly one
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=69s)** — missing vitamin called vitamin B1 thiamine. There's not enough thiamine in that nerve to
- **[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=75s)** — allow the nerve to work. That nerve is dependent on B1. You need a very special type
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=80s)** — B vitamin that has been changed to a fat soluble version. The name of that is called
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=87s)** — benfotamine. I'll put in the description of how to spell it. There's not enough thiamine in
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=91s)** — that nerve to allow the nerve to work. There's a couple things that will deplete B1 from the
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=97s)** — nerve. Sugar destroys nerves. If you drink a lot of alcohol, it destroys your liver. Sugar and
- **[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=104s)** — alcohol deplete B1 and you want to put that back. Benfotamine is what you need. Whatever
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=109s)** — recommends on the dosage on the back of the bottle times four because you want to take more
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=115s)** — to really penetrate to fix this problem right here. Another diagnostic indicator or a window
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=122s)** — to look inside your body is to notice if your toes get blue. It could be the fingertips too.
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=128s)** — It has to do with a part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system. Another
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=133s)** — word for that is called the fight-or-flight system. And there's a problem with this system
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=138s)** — in that it's over-activated. One of the treatments for this, the medical treatment,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=143s)** — is they use a calcium channel blocker. When they're exposed to cold, their fingers and
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=149s)** — their toes become blue. What would be a natural version of a calcium channel blocker? That's
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=155s)** — magnesium. Magnesium is the primary regulator of calcium that's stuck inside the cell. And so
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=161s)** — one cause of high blood pressure is too much calcium because calcium is all about contraction
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=168s)** — and magnesium is all about relaxation. So magnesium fixes this over-contraction problem.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=174s)** — The thing to know about magnesium is that you don't want to just take any type of magnesium.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=179s)** — You want to take magnesium glycinate because that's the one that you can absorb like 80%.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=183s)** — The next one also relates to what I just talked about. Foot cramps, especially at night
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=189s)** — or in the early morning. Magnesium in the tissue is going to be lowest in the early
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=194s)** — morning. You can also get those cramps in the calf muscle right above here. Cramps or
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=198s)** — trolley horses are the earliest symptom of a magnesium deficiency. The simple remedy is to
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=203s)** — take magnesium glycinate. Remember we talked about that. You want to take at least four
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=208s)** — to five to six to even up to 800 milligrams for a period of weeks to really fix this
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=216s)** — deficiency. Just by taking it one time doesn't really help it. The problem with
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=220s)** — magnesium deficiency is that it's very hard to detect. A lot of people are deficient in it.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=224s)** — Magnesium is really important in a lot of things. If you're deficient, you're going to
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=228s)** — have cramps. Putting the magnesium back in there will help the cramp. The next thing
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=232s)** — we're going to talk about is when you have swollen feet. This usually is involved with
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=237s)** — diabetes because they have more sugar in the blood. And if someone has more sugar,
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=241s)** — they're going to be retaining a lot more sodium and a lot more water and they're
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=244s)** — going to have puffy feet. The antidote is to come up with sugar if you have diabetes.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=249s)** — Another problem that you might have is discoloration of the lower leg. Just the
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=254s)** — feet start changing colors and they look very unhealthy. It could be a circulation problem.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=260s)** — You can have deep vein thrombosis, which is a condition where you're getting clots in
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=266s)** — the veins and that's going to create fluid retention in the foot, discoloration in the
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=272s)** — lower part of the leg. And so those clots can come from many different reasons. One being
- **[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=276s)** — high levels of stress and also vitamin E is an antidote to excess clotting because vitamin E
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=282s)** — kind of thins the blood. If you get more pain or more weakness when you exercise, suspect
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=288s)** — something called intermittent clodification and get it checked out from the doctor because
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=292s)** — that's a vascular problem. And with that problem you get better when you rest. Next
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=297s)** — problem is big toe pain right here. That's gout. Gout usually is a problem with too much uric
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=304s)** — Some people even notice if they cut down their oxalates, their toe pain goes away and that would
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=309s)** — be like spinach, almonds, chocolate. The antidote to high levels of oxalates, whether it's a
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=316s)** — kidney stone or whatever, is magnesium and prevent the kidney stone situation or the oxalate
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=324s)** — arthritic situation that some people have. Other ways that you can diagnose things on your foot
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=328s)** — If you have an ulcer on the foot, that's classic diabetes because you're not getting
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=333s)** — enough oxygen. In a diabetic situation, if you notice the toes of the feet get destroyed first
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=340s)** — and then it moves up this way. This is why they have to sometimes remove the toes in
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=345s)** — diabetics. Completely unnecessary. You need that benfotamine and you need to get on a low carb
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=350s)** — diet but unfortunately you probably won't hear that from your doctor. They're more into
- **[05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=354s)** — symptoms. Couple things with the nail bed. You can look at the nail bed of your toes and tell a
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=360s)** — lot about your overall health. For example, if it's yellowish, that could be fungus but it
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=366s)** — could be jaundice too with the liver. But if there's a fungus, that means there's a problem
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=370s)** — with your gut and you can fix fungus by adding probiotics and really getting healthy
- **[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=377s)** — starting with your gut. Now there's all sorts of remedies as well like tea tree oil and
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=382s)** — iodine on the toenail. If your immune system is weak because you don't have enough vitamin D,
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=386s)** — then the yeast wins. And of course yeast lives on sugar so you're gonna have to get off sugar
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=392s)** — as well. If there's funkiness with the toenail like splitting, let's say it's curving up or
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=397s)** — curving down, these are all indicators of not necessarily disease but nutritional deficiencies.
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=404s)** — But in this video, I just wanted to give you some insights on how to use your foot
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=409s)** — as a diagnostic window to other issues. And if you want to know more information
- **[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGIX50eYaGU&t=415s)** — about the nail beds, you should watch this video right here. Check it out.
