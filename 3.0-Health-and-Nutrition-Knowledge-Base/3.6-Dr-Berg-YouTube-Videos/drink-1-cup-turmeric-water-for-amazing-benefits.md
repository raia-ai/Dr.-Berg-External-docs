- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=0s)** — You want to drink one cup of turmeric water every single night or morning for amazing benefits.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=7s)** — The active compound in turmeric is called curcumin. And there's some serious research
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=13s)** — on this one compound that you need to know about. But before you follow any of the advice
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=17s)** — I'm going to share with you, obviously check with your doctor to get, you know, an okay.
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=22s)** — Especially if you're on medications because you can't always come off certain medications,
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=25s)** — you know, cold turkey. The first thing I want to talk about is NSAIDs. Like ibuprofen
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=29s)** — and aspirin. In one study, curcumin was just as effective as ibuprofen in reducing pain from
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=38s)** — arthritis. But without the side effects, curcumin also showed some similar benefits to aspirin,
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=44s)** — which is quite amazing because the problem with aspirin is it can burn a hole in your stomach.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=48s)** — Let's get to number two. Cortical steroids like prednisone. I used to take this for
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=54s)** — every single year until it eventually stopped working. Curcumin in one study showed comparable
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=60s)** — results to prednisone in reducing inflammation for rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and irritable
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=67s)** — bowel disease. Number three, curcumin showed anti-depressant effects similar to Prozac and
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=74s)** — Zoloft in reducing symptoms of depression. Apparently the theory is that it increases
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=79s)** — serotonin and dopamine very similar to the SSRIs. Number four, curcumin has anti-diabetic
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=86s)** — properties. Some studies show that curcumin can have similar effects to metformin in supporting
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=93s)** — blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. As you may or may not know, there's a black warning
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=98s)** — label on metformin because one of the dangerous side effects is called lactic acidosis. So
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=109s)** — we get to number five, anticoagulants. These are the things that thin the blood. The anticoagulation
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=114s)** — or anti-clotting factors in curcumin are similar to warfarin and aspirin. This could be used as
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=121s)** — a substitute, especially if for some reason they can't take certain medications. Number six,
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=126s)** — statins. In certain studies, which I'll list down below in the description,
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=130s)** — curcumin showed a decrease in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as creating a
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=138s)** — endothelial layer of the inside of the artery, which is given more of a protective effect.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=143s)** — Because the way that statins work is they just basically block cholesterol. Curcumin instead
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=147s)** — works a different way. It basically helps you optimize your lipids. Number seven, chemotherapy.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=153s)** — So there's a drug called 5-flouryuracil, and this is a chemotherapy drug. There was a
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=158s)** — study comparing curcumin to this drug. So apparently curcumin has some effects of slowing
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=164s)** — down or inhibiting the growth of certain cancer cells, while at the same time protecting the
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=169s)** — normal cells. Number eight, anti-inflammatory drugs, especially for irritable bowel disease.
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=176s)** — Curcumin was shown to decrease the side effects from both Crohn's and ulcerative
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=181s)** — colitis in a comparable fashion to a drug called mesalamine. Number nine,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=188s)** — hypertensive drugs. Curcumin has pretty potent effects on the endothelial layer on the
- **[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=193s)** — side of the artery, creating a significant decrease in stiffness in the artery, as well
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=198s)** — as lowering the blood pressure. And number ten, curcumin has a pretty potent antifungal effect.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=202s)** — Collectively, that's an antimicrobial effect. It can inhibit certain pathogens, especially
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=208s)** — fungi. While the effect of curcumin is not an actual substitute, it can actually potentially
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=214s)** — help or enhance the effects of other drugs with lessening the side effects, especially when
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=219s)** — you get into someone taking antifungals or antibiotics that then create resistance.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=225s)** — Now these microbes become superbugs and they're almost impossible to destroy. Now the question
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=230s)** — is when would you want to take your curcumin? In the morning or at night or before a meal?
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=236s)** — Well, it depends what kind of problems you have. If you have more arthritis, I would
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=240s)** — recommend taking this drink in the morning. If you have more digestive problems, I recommend
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=247s)** — this right before you eat. If you have more problems with other issues like anxiety or
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=253s)** — sleep-related, then take it right before you go to bed. So if you want to increase the
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=257s)** — bioavailability, take it with some fat or with a meal or you can take it with black pepper.
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=263s)** — And this is because curcumin has poor bioavailability. When you take turmeric,
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=268s)** — you only get very very tiny amounts of this curcumin. Because if you take a look at nature
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=273s)** — what curcumin really is, it is a pesticide and it also has other properties to protect the plant
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=279s)** — from UV radiation. So when we take it ourselves, we could piggyback on all of the different
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=285s)** — effects. And the effectiveness is going to start on your digestive track, okay? And then
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=290s)** — you're going to absorb some of it. The microbes even consume some of it and then they
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=296s)** — create additional compounds that help you in many different ways. One being reducing inflammation.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=302s)** — This is why it's so good for inflammation in your gut. Another thing it'll do, it'll increase
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=308s)** — several strains of the beneficial bacteria while also inhibiting some of the pathogenic
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=315s)** — bacteria, which is pretty wild. Some of the mistakes that people make, taking way too much.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=319s)** — Or they might take it but without the black pepper. Black pepper helps absorption by 2000%.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=325s)** — What you want to do is you want to take a glass of water, warm water, okay? And you
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=332s)** — want to take your black pepper, take a little pinch of it, put that in the water,
- **[05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=337s)** — mix it into it with a half of a lemon. You just drink it down. It's slightly warm. It's not
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=342s)** — boiled. And then experience the benefits. Another way to take it is through making this,
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=347s)** — what's called golden milk. So you're going to mix a half of a teaspoon of
- **[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=351s)** — turmeric in either milk or coconut milk. I would recommend coconut milk. That seems to be
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=357s)** — pretty delicious. Then you're going to add a fourth of a teaspoon of cinnamon,
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=362s)** — a little pinch of pepper, and you're going to heat this up, not to a boil,
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=366s)** — but just before a boil. And you're going to sip it. It makes a wonderful drink.
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=369s)** — And this is the one that I probably would recommend before bed. Now another way you can
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=373s)** — take this is with a smoothie. A half of a teaspoon of turmeric with a cup of kefir. I'd
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=380s)** — recommend like sheep kefir if you can find it or even goat's milk kefir, grass fed. And
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=385s)** — you take a half of a cup of blueberries. You put it in a blender and you blend it. And you have a
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=392s)** — wonderful drink. Now another way you can take turmeric, and this is mainly if you have a
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=396s)** — sore throat or you have this cough that you just can't get rid of. It's for the immune
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=400s)** — system. You take a half of a cup of hot water, okay, because you want to have it hot,
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=406s)** — but not to the point where you boil the water. But it just makes it really hot. And
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=410s)** — this one you're going to add a level teaspoon of turmeric and then a tablespoon of raw
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=416s)** — honey. And you're going to kind of dissolve as much as you can in this hot water. And then
- **[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=420s)** — you're going to slug that down once or twice a day. Your throat is going to feel wonderful.
- **[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=425s)** — And again, if you have more arthritis inflammation, take it in the morning. So that
- **[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=429s)** — way all day you have less inflammation. Or if you have other problems, definitely sleep or
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=434s)** — stress, other issues that are not related to inflammation, you can take that before you go
- **[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=438s)** — to bed. But also remember if you have digestive issues, take it right before you eat. It will
- **[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=444s)** — help prevent bloating as well. Now if you haven't seen my other video on turmeric,
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QftLonhnuk&t=448s)** — you should check it out. I put it up right here.
