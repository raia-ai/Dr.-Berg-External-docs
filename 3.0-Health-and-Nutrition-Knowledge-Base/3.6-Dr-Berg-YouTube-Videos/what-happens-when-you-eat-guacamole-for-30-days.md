- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=0s)** — What would happen if you drank lemon water every single day for 30 days?
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=4s)** — We are so focused on high blood pressure, really no one's talking about low blood pressure,
- **[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=9s)** — where you just don't have enough volume of blood in your body. When you wake up in the morning,
- **[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=14s)** — you have the lowest volume of blood compared to at the end of the day. When your blood volume
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=20s)** — is too low, if you stand up too fast, you could feel dizzy. Your blood pressure might even be
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=25s)** — low. If we just take an elite athlete and compare that athlete to an average person that doesn't
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=31s)** — really exercise, the elite athlete is carrying around 50% more blood volume. You definitely
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=39s)** — are not going to have the same performance when you exercise. You're just not going to
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=42s)** — feel quite the same. I do not like drinking anything in the morning because typically when
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=47s)** — I drink liquid in the morning, I just don't feel right. I'll drink coffee, but I don't want
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=52s)** — to drink anything else until the afternoon. I finally realize what that is and I want to
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=58s)** — give you a solution. If you just drink water, especially in the morning when you have the
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=63s)** — lowest blood volume, you're basically going to be diluting these electrolytes, specifically
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=68s)** — sodium. That's a huge mistake because you're going to be more dehydrated. It's not just
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=73s)** — water that increases the volume of blood. You also need to add some salt. That salt
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=79s)** — will allow you to hold the water in your blood. Just a pinch of that sea salt with lemon is
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=84s)** — going to make you feel so much better, especially if you do it for 30 days and especially one hour
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=89s)** — before you exercise as well. For some people, they might even feel better if they add even
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=93s)** — more salt. Then if you also look at the circadian rhythm of the entire 24 hours,
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=98s)** — where's the highest amount of cortisol? In the morning at 8 a.m. That's when you have the
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=103s)** — highest level of cortisol. Did you know what can lower cortisol is sodium? That's right.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=108s)** — This is why some people have a little salt before they go to bed to lower cortisol so they can
- **[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=113s)** — sleep better. In the morning when cortisol is very, very high, that can also affect feeling
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=118s)** — stressed or also mobilizing sugar from your liver, which affects your blood sugar. What you
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=123s)** — need to know is that salt can help reduce cortisol. By having salt in the morning, you
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=127s)** — can start with a stress-free day and with enough volume of fluid to be able to have the
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=133s)** — energy and the exercise that you need. And also to prevent if you get up too quickly and
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=137s)** — a little dizzy, you won't have that if you have enough volume of fluid. That's a salt benefit.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=142s)** — Of course I would use like a pinch of Himalayan sea salt. Or if you do have a tendency that
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=147s)** — high blood pressure and you want more potassium magnesium, you can use the Baja gold salt,
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=152s)** — which is only 70% sodium and then the rest is all these other minerals. But now let's talk
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=158s)** — about the benefits of the lemon. If you use the fresh lemon and say you cut it in half and
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=162s)** — you take both sides of lemon, you just squeeze them in there so you have the juice of one
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=166s)** — lemon. You'll be getting some additional things that you wouldn't get from bottle lemon juice
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=170s)** — and that would be vitamin C. Vitamin C is good for skin. It's good as an antioxidant for the
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=174s)** — inside of your arteries. But you know having an actual lemon is not always convenient. It is
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=178s)** — more convenient when you have a bottle of lemon juice in your refrigerator. I would highly
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=182s)** — recommend always doing organic lemon juice or an organic lemon because they use pesticides and
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=187s)** — you don't want that in this drink. There's one thing about lemons and limes. When you
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=191s)** — spray them, they absorb that pesticide inside the actual lemon. We also have the benefit of
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=196s)** — something called citric acid. Citric acid helps to reduce the risk of kidney stones because it
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=203s)** — binds with the this oxalate thing and then it reduces the chance of the formation of that
- **[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=209s)** — stone. Lemon also has a tendency to reduce the incidence of gout because it can help lower
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=215s)** — uric acid. So it's really good for the kidneys. Certain things in lemon like the
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=219s)** — nutrients actually help the phase one phase two detoxification of the liver which allows you to
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=224s)** — pull out different chemicals. The lemon also acts on the bile and also the tartness of the
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=230s)** — lemon. It helps to thin the bile. It helps to reduce the incidence of gallstones as it helps
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=236s)** — to detoxify the liver. Also the actual stomach. The combination of lemon and salt. It's really
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=242s)** — good for digestion because it can stimulate digestive enzymes and juices to get the
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=248s)** — flowing. The properties in lemon can also help regulate cholesterol issues. It can provide
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=253s)** — antioxidants to the inside of the arteries to help reduce the risk of certain types of
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=258s)** — problems for the heart. The polyphenols in the lemon actually increase the diversity of the
- **[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=263s)** — microbiome. The microbes in your gut actually thrive which is pretty wild. There's certain
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=267s)** — properties in lemon and salt that are antimicrobial. Lemons also can help increase
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=272s)** — the absorption of non-heme iron which is iron in plants. So if someone's anemic,
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=279s)** — taking lemon juice can help them. Also as a side note, if you have a tendency to develop
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=282s)** — kidney stones, I would also add magnesium and potassium to your protocol. One big mistake with
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=288s)** — lemon water. If you're doing this over a period of time and you're drinking it in your
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=292s)** — mouth, the acidity can affect your enamel and your teeth. So I would highly recommend using
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=298s)** — and then of course, cleaning out your mouth with water after you're done. I do my lemon salt water
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=303s)** — right after I drink my coffee in the morning. Another thing that I occasionally do is I'll take
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=308s)** — an organic lemon, the whole thing, the peel and all with the seeds and I will blend it
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=313s)** — with a glass of water and then also add this little pinch of sea salt to it because
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=319s)** — there are so many additional things in the actual peel itself and right underneath the peel
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=325s)** — all these bioflavonoids are really good for so many things. But for some people salty lemon
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=331s)** — water might be too tart and they'd like it sweet. I would highly recommend adding a couple drops
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=336s)** — of liquid stevia and then we turn this tart thing into lemonade. It actually is amazing.
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=341s)** — Your kids would love it as well and some people also add a little bit of alpacitor vinegar
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=345s)** — to that mix. So that would be one tablespoon if you wanted to take it to the next level.
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80vA_8MJQI&t=349s)** — But anyway, I just wanted to give you this simple quick tip to see if it can help you.
