- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about how to permanently get rid of blackheads and this other thing called sebaceous filaments.
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=8s)** — Which actually a lot of people have a confusion between these two and that's what I am going to clarify today.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=13s)** — So there are so many treatments out there using various tapes, creams, lotions.
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=19s)** — Today we are going to talk about how to look deeper inside and correct the imbalances causing this problem.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=25s)** — The first let's look at a typical treatment. As you can see in this video, this is what people do.
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=32s)** — And they are applying it to their nose and then they are removing these little tiny filaments from the different pores in their skin.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=39s)** — The actual little pores are called follicles. Sometimes people think follicles are hairs. No.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=45s)** — They are the little sac that hold the oil and sometimes the hair.
- **[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=48s)** — So as you can see you are literally ripping out the material inside these tiny little caverns.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=54s)** — They are not getting rid of blackheads. It is completely different.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=57s)** — Blackheads are differentiated from whiteheads because there is a little plug on top of the pore that keeps the material, the fats and oils and bacteria from oxidizing.
- **[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=69s)** — So if we don't have a plug on top of this pore, it is going to be exposed to oxygen.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=73s)** — And then we are going to oxidize that material and that material is going to turn darker.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=78s)** — Just like if you were to bite into an apple and have it oxidized and turn brown.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=84s)** — So that is what a blackhead is.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=87s)** — And a blackhead and a whitehead is kind of a precursor to acne.
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=91s)** — And it most commonly happens during puberty. Of course, I had it really bad.
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=95s)** — I wish I would have known the information in this video back then because I thought it was dirty in there and I had to clean it and I would be scrubbing my skin for hours.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=105s)** — And you know what? They just created more inflammation and more redness.
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=108s)** — So that is not the way to do it.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=110s)** — Now, as far as these sebaceous filaments go, you can get them removed through various ways.
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=116s)** — Whether it is going to be a tape or a certain type of lotion or compound.
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=122s)** — But they come right back.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=123s)** — So the big question is what is really behind these problems and how can we resolve it permanently?
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=128s)** — Well, for that I have another review here.
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=131s)** — And you can see sebaceous filaments and blackheads come from the body producing too much sebum.
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=138s)** — So the real problem is we have a gland that is overproducing.
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=143s)** — And the question is why?
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=145s)** — Well, it is because of this right here, this hormone called androgens.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=148s)** — This is why during puberty people have more incidence of these problems, right?
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=154s)** — But it can also happen at different points of your life as well as during pregnancy.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=158s)** — So how do we regulate androgens? That is the big question.
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=164s)** — To help reduce and balance out sebum, which is the oil gland.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=169s)** — Well, the first one is vitamin A.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=172s)** — Now, with vitamin A there are certain creams that people rub on their skin to help get rid of blackheads and sebaceous filaments.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=179s)** — But that is kind of treating the symptom.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=181s)** — Why do not we just fix it by taking more vitamin A?
- **[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=185s)** — Now, you might say, well, I am eating a lot of carrots.
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=187s)** — Well, you might be, but that is the precursor called beta-carotene.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=191s)** — You need the actual active form of vitamin A, which is retinol, to really make sure it works.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=196s)** — So the question is what foods are high in retinol? I am getting to that.
- **[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=200s)** — Let us go to the next one.
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=201s)** — Vitamin D. Vitamin D also helps reduce sebum.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=207s)** — And omega-3 fatty acids also help reduce sebum.
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=211s)** — So take a wild guess.
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=212s)** — What substance has all three of these great nutrients?
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=216s)** — Well, if you guess cod liver oil, you are correct.
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=220s)** — It is the cod liver oil that has not just the active form of vitamin A, retinol, but also vitamin D and omega-3.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=228s)** — In fact, cod liver oil has the most vitamin A.
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=232s)** — But you can also get your vitamin A from other foods as well, like egg yolks and fish and sardines.
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=240s)** — And there is a whole list of things that you can get it from.
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=243s)** — There is more to the story, okay?
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=244s)** — You also have high levels of seed oil.
- **[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=247s)** — That is omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=249s)** — It just so happens when you consume too much of that, you actually indirectly decrease the omega-3 fatty acids.
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=257s)** — So my viewpoint is out of all the things that are creating this problem with too much sebum, it is excessive amounts of seed oils.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=266s)** — I am talking about the soy oil, the canola, the corn oil in most of our foods.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=271s)** — And so we must increase omega-3 and decrease omega-6 fatty acids.
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=277s)** — Alright, there is more to the story.
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=278s)** — You see this right here? It is called carbohydrates and sugars.
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=282s)** — When you have too many carbohydrates and sugars, guess what? You increase insulin.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=287s)** — And when you increase insulin, you increase androgens.
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=291s)** — This is why women who have polycystic ovarian syndrome, which is too much androgens, have way too much insulin.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=297s)** — And the way to correct this is simply reducing your insulin levels.
- **[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=302s)** — You are going to have to lower your carbs and sugars, and you are also going to have to decrease the frequency of how many times you eat.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=310s)** — Intermittent fasting helps decrease the sebum as well.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=313s)** — And boy, I wish I would have known that in school because I was the king of snacking.
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=318s)** — I would have so many different meals through the day and snacking at night.
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=321s)** — I did not know that increases insulin, which then increases androgens and gives me more acne.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=327s)** — Again, what we are trying to do is we are trying to get rid of the underlying imbalance using mainly diet with some nutrients.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=335s)** — So that way we do not have to put all these topical things on our skin and create the sterilization effect,
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=340s)** — get rid of all the good friendly bacteria on the skin, create more redness and more aggravation to your skin.
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=347s)** — But there is one more thing to talk about, and that is this right here, zinc.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=352s)** — A deficiency of zinc will increase the oil gland and give you more sebum.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=357s)** — So you want to make sure you have enough zinc. Where do you get zinc?
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=361s)** — Well, shellfish, oysters, things like that, but you can also get it from red meat.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=365s)** — But the more likely cause of a zinc deficiency is you are consuming too many carbs and sugars,
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=370s)** — or going through too much stress. That can deplete zinc as well.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=376s)** — When you consume a lot of cereal or grains, especially whole grains, which is high in phytic acid,
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=383s)** — that is going to pull the zinc out too. So that could be another reason why you might be deficient in zinc.
- **[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=389s)** — But now you have the plan to not only get rid of blackheads, whiteheads, acne, sebaceous filaments,
- **[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=396s)** — but you are making sure that these things do not come back because you are getting rid of the deeper cause.
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=402s)** — And if you have not seen my other video on blackheads, I am going to put it up right here.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vf2ylY2ds&t=406s)** — It was very, very popular and it is a very cool video.
