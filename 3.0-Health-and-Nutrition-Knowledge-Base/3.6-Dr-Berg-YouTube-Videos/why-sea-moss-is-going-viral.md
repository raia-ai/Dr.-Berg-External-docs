- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=0s)** — So today we're going to talk about sea moss. You probably have heard about sea moss.
- **[00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=4s)** — It's all over social media. What actually is it? Well, sea kelp and sea moss are types of seaweed,
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=11s)** — which are basically plants that can grow underneath the water. And when you look at sea moss versus
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=17s)** — sea kelp, they're fairly similar in what's in them as far as overall nutrition content. People
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=23s)** — are using sea moss on their skin to take it internally to help their digestive system,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=30s)** — to help their inflammation. And people are getting all sorts of benefits from this,
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=34s)** — from increasing their testosterone, increasing their overall health. Let me first state that
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=40s)** — sea moss has a number of things that people talk about. It has amino acids. That's a type
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=45s)** — of protein. It has fiber. It has vitamins. It has minerals, fatty acids, phytonutrients.
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=54s)** — And the list goes on and on and on and on. Now, of course, if you look at the protein,
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=58s)** — the amino acids, it doesn't compare to a steak or animal protein. What does stand out
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=64s)** — with sea moss and other types of sea kelp is the minerals, especially the trace minerals.
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=72s)** — Trace minerals are those minerals that are needed in very, very small amounts but are very,
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=77s)** — very necessary. And you're not going to find a lot of these trace minerals in foods unless
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=82s)** — you're close to the ocean. Now, what is the purpose of trace minerals anyway? Well,
- **[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=88s)** — one of the purposes for human health for trace minerals is that they help to activate
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=92s)** — enzymes and certain other proteins that do the work of the body. For example, there is an enzyme
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=100s)** — that helps you convert from T4, the inactive version of the thyroid hormone, to T3,
- **[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=108s)** — the active form of the thyroid hormone. And that enzyme is dependent on selenium. Well,
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=114s)** — guess what? Where are you going to get selenium? You can get it in Brazil nuts,
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=118s)** — but it's not necessarily in other nuts of any significant amount. And what do we have to
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=130s)** — get this selenium? Selenium not only helps you with the thyroid, selenium is necessary
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=137s)** — for certain proteins to help you detoxify mercury. Selenium is necessary for your
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=144s)** — immune system. Okay, like if you don't have enough selenium, you cannot create the T helper
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=150s)** — cells. T helper cells are like the general of the army for your immune system. They help
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=156s)** — control and coordinate all the other immune cells in the attack against viruses and cancer
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=166s)** — and any other type of pathogenic invasion. And so the problem is it's hard to get these trace
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=171s)** — minerals, especially selenium from food unless you eat something from the sea. Iodine is also
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=178s)** — necessary for the thyroid. And so without iodine, you can't make the thyroid hormones.
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=183s)** — But iodine is also really, really important to help regulate estrogen. And this is why when
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=190s)** — women are deficient in iodine, they might get breast cancer or ovarian cysts. Japanese women
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=197s)** — are much less at risk of getting breast cancer. And I really think it's because the Japanese
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=203s)** — as a culture consumes 25 times more iodine than the U.S. So I really think a lot of
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=211s)** — benefits from sea moss are coming because finally the person is being satisfied with
- **[03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=216s)** — the trace minerals which they've been missing. Now it is true that sea moss has carrageenan.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=223s)** — And any seaweed that has red in it is going to have some carrageenan. There's a really big
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=228s)** — difference in eating carrageenan that is naturally in sea moss versus carrageenan that
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=235s)** — you eat.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=237s)** — So sea moss and even sea kelp is a great product not only to help get the trace minerals,
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=244s)** — which I think is the number one benefit, but also some of these other phytonutrients that
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=249s)** — create some health benefits that extend way beyond just your normal vitamins and minerals.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=255s)** — Now since we're on the topic of trace minerals, there's a lot more to be said about
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6oOuI-S7Y&t=258s)** — that. If you haven't seen this video, check it out.
