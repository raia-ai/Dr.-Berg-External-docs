- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=0s)** — These are my top 7 health tips based on science. Most doctors ignore these.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=5s)** — This first risk factor is equivalent to smoking. Not just one cigarette a day.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=11s)** — 15 cigarettes every single day. Can you guess what it is? Loneliness.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=15s)** — That is a major stress on our bodies. Of course, there's different levels of loneliness.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=20s)** — You have a very severe level where you just lost a loved one, which is going to make you very lonely.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=25s)** — Social isolation. It will keep the chronic elevation of cortisol going on.
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=30s)** — A lot of inflammation occurs with this. This is why they're at risk for heart disease, stroke, and definitely high blood pressure.
- **[00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=36s)** — Loneliness also shuts down certain genes to your immune system, making you more vulnerable to developing cancer and getting viral infections.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=45s)** — Humans are very social beings, and when they don't have that social aspect, all sorts of health problems occur.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=50s)** — What would be the health tip that would come from that?
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=52s)** — Quality relationships. At least three. That will lift you up is super therapeutic.
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=57s)** — Where you have a regular social engagement.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=61s)** — Another thing to do is volunteer and help some group or some person.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=66s)** — Because it's very therapeutic to help another. Let's go to number two.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=70s)** — Lack of sleep. Getting less than five hours of sleep will increase your risk for early death by 30%.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=76s)** — It two to three X's the risk of gaining weight, craving foods, developing diabetes.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=83s)** — It was revealed that there's brain aging with people that don't sleep. What's the tip on that one?
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=89s)** — Get at least seven hours of sleep. Let's get to number three. Refine sugar.
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=94s)** — That would be maltodextrin, modified food starch, modified corn starch, wheat flour, rice flour. That's all hidden sugar.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=101s)** — It's one of the key drivers for developing liver fat and obesity and Alzheimer's.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=106s)** — One of the biggest things that this refined sugar does and refined starch is making you old really quick and keeping your body inflamed.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=114s)** — What do you think the best tip to counter that would be?
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=117s)** — Low carb ketogenic diet. There's a really cool app that I came up with. It's called Dr. Berg Junk Food Meter.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=124s)** — It's a free app if you have an Apple or an Android phone.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=126s)** — It allows you to quickly scan any food, any barcode, or even the picture of the label and focus in on the key three ingredients in most junk foods.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=136s)** — Sugars, starches, and seed oils. Most people have no idea how much of those three ingredients that they're consuming in the refrigerator or the pantry.
- **[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=145s)** — Let me show you what I'm talking about before we get to number four.
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=147s)** — All you have to do is download it. It's free. Pull up a food. Hover over the barcode and start scanning.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=154s)** — And it quickly scans and shows you how much starch, seed oil, and sugar.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=158s)** — You can see in this one there's 19 grams of sugar in this yogurt. Crazy amounts. And there's some starch as well.
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=163s)** — Let's pick another food. Pop-Tart. Holy mackerel. Look at it. You have starch, 39 grams. Got some seed oils in there. And you got sugar in there.
- **[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=172s)** — You can see the junk food score at the top is a 10, which means it's really, really bad.
- **[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=178s)** — It tells you what kind of ingredients that we're reading.
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=181s)** — Let's do another food. Hot dog. This one has starch. So there's hidden starch. What kind of starch?
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=187s)** — They're putting corn syrup in there and modified food starch. Not too healthy.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=191s)** — Can you take a while to guess what number four is? Industrial seed oils.
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=196s)** — I'm talking about what most people fry their food in. They're going to create a lot of inflammation in the body because
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=202s)** — seed oils are an unsaturated fat, which means they're very vulnerable to oxygen, heat, and light.
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=208s)** — How is it that you can keep these oils right in your cupboard without having to refrigerate them to keep them shelf stable?
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=215s)** — Because it builds up over time, it's a slow poison.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=218s)** — The health tip based on that is to start cooking with healthy oils. Extra virgin olive oil.
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=225s)** — Grass-fed butter. Halo. Lard. Only use those oils in your food as well as cooking things.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=233s)** — This next risk factor. Visceral fat, the fat around the organs, really will tell you a lot about how long you're going to live or if you're going to have a health problem.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=244s)** — You can literally look down at your belly right now. If it sticks out, we know you have not just visceral fat, you have liver fat too.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=251s)** — It's one of the best indicators of heart disease. This is the heart right here. And this is the epicardial fat. It goes directly into the coronary arteries.
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=262s)** — Did you realize that even children that are four years old are starting to get visceral fat? So it's not just happening as we get older.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=272s)** — There's no drug or no diagnosis code that can get rid of it. The only way to get rid of it is through your lifestyle changes.
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=279s)** — The biggest top two things to do are intermittent fasting and lowering your carbohydrates and sugars. That's called a low carb diet or the ketogenic diet.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=290s)** — Let's get to number six. Constant eating or snacking. You're just basically eating too much of the wrong food and you're eating too many meals.
- **[04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=299s)** — I'm not even talking about eating candy bars. I'm talking about eating anything. Chronic eating or snacking completely and utterly shuts down the self cleaning of old damaged cells.
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=310s)** — Your body fills up with dirty damaged tissue. You age a lot faster than you should. For this tip, cutting out snacking is a super valuable tip for everyone.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=322s)** — For most people, what I'm going to recommend is a very simple tip. Only eat when you're hungry and don't eat when you're not. Be super powerful for anti-aging and to make you feel a lot better.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=334s)** — The last factor that creates a lot of problems has to do with three specific nutrient deficiencies. A magnesium deficiency.
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=342s)** — When you're deficient, people tend to get high blood pressure. They might get arrhythmias, muscle cramps. What has magnesium? Lethe greens, pumpkin seeds, or you could take magnesium glycinate as a supplement.
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=355s)** — Next nutrient is vitamin D. It said 40% of people are deficient in vitamin D. I think it's more like 90%.
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=362s)** — When you're deficient in vitamin D, you get early risk of dying. You get a lot of inflammation. You get depressed.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=368s)** — You need at least 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3 every single day. This third nutrient is going to surprise you. And it's choline. A lack of choline will cause the fatty liver.
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=382s)** — You could have problems with memory and cognitive function. Normally our bodies need about 550 mg per day of choline. The best source of choline is egg yolk and liver.
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=393s)** — Now that you know the top 7 tips to better your health, there's a twist. None of this will really work unless you know the one most important food that will create health.
- **[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ffrE7An-8&t=405s)** — Trust me, you're going to be shocked. This is the video that you should watch right now. Click it.
