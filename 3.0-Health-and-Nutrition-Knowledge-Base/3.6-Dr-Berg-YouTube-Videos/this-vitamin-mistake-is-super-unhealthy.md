- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=0s)** — Is it possible you might be overdosing on the wrong vitamin E? Vitamin E is very interesting
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=6s)** — because you'll see reports that, oh yeah, vitamin E causes cancer. It causes cardiovascular
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=13s)** — damage. Now, how can that be? We will talk about that and I'm going to clear up the
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=16s)** — confusion so it'll all make sense. In 1964, it was discovered that there is another vitamin
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=23s)** — E compound. Vitamin E is not just one thing. It's many things in two different groups.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=31s)** — We're just going to compare tocotrinols to tocopherols as far as antioxidants, as
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=35s)** — far as the potency. Tocotrinols, hands down, are so much more powerful. Let's say, for
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=40s)** — example, you just take one isolated part of the vitamin E complex, alpha-tocopherol,
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=45s)** — and you're taking it synthetically or even naturally. It's going to be more of a pro-oxidant
- **[00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=49s)** — and create more damage. This is why you see mixed reviews on vitamin E. Like, wow, one
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=55s)** — study will show that it creates some damage. Another study shows that it can actually help
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=60s)** — someone in some way. But you're not looking at the whole picture because in nature, antioxidants
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=64s)** — never come like that. Let's talk a little bit more about these tocotrinols because
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=68s)** — this might be new to you. I really like the tocotrinols, which just happens to
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=73s)** — have an anti-cancer effect. It also is a very potent anti-inflammatory as well.
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=77s)** — In animal studies, they found that the tocotrinol can even increase lifespan by 19%. Some people
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=83s)** — might correlate that over to humans, probably just because of the antioxidant effect.
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=87s)** — It's very powerful, protecting something against oxidation. That leads us to the
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=92s)** — next thing that tocotrinols are really good at. Neuroprotection. Let's say, for
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=97s)** — example, someone had a stroke and they need some quick repair. Tocotrinols would
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=103s)** — be the answer for that. It definitely protects the neurons in the brain against oxidative
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=107s)** — damage. It's really good for any type of neurodegenerative diseases. That includes
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=112s)** — Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, dementia. Tocotrinols also have a similar effect to statins as
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=119s)** — far as what they can do to oxidative LDL, which is behind inflammation inside the arteries.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=126s)** — In one study, within six months, dramatically decreased atherosclerotic lesions. And over
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=133s)** — time, 18 months, they could barely find those lesions. All the things that vitamin
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=138s)** — E can help you with, it's the arteries. The arteries that are involved in blood
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=143s)** — flow to the heart, as well as what tocotrinols can do to the heart muscle itself. People
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=149s)** — can have heart attacks, not from a clogged artery, but just the muscle just doesn't
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=153s)** — have the oxygen and just cramps up and then you have a heart attack. If someone adds intense
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=157s)** — exercise on top of that, you can imagine the level of oxidative stress is like
- **[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=161s)** — off the charts. I think after a workout, a person should take tocotrinols. Tocotrinols
- **[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=166s)** — can actually increase the oxygen carrying capacity. If they took that after they
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=170s)** — worked out, they would see a great improvement in recovery. A lot of people that do high
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=176s)** — altitude training or even climb mountains take more vitamin E because when you're
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=181s)** — at high altitudes, there's definitely a lot more oxidative stress. I probably personally
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=186s)** — would not take a tocophora. I would take tocotrinols because they're more potent.
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=191s)** — You want to take like maybe smaller amounts and spread them out through the day. Anyone
- **[03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=195s)** — with age-related cognitive decline should be on a good tocotrinol supplement. There's
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=201s)** — also some interesting data on using tocotrinols to help reverse some of the damage from
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=206s)** — radiation. Even the military is studying that as well because they found in my
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=210s)** — studies that even lethal doses of radiation can be mitigated with these tocotrinols.
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=218s)** — There's also a pretty potent scar tissue protection benefit. If you have inflammation
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=224s)** — in your liver, for example, and you take tocotrinols, it can slow down the
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=228s)** — progression going into the scar tissue, which I'm talking about cirrhosis. What
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=233s)** — about tocopherols? Should we take them at all? Do they work better for certain
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=237s)** — There are several advantages for taking tocopherol. Number one, widespread availability.
- **[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=244s)** — They're in a lot more foods. Green vegetables that have chlorophyll, in seeds, in nuts.
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=251s)** — They're in olives, olive oil. Another thing about tocopherols is that there's a lot more
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=256s)** — research on tocopherols as an antioxidant and what it can do. It's good for overall
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=260s)** — protection of the cell membranes and oxidative stress. But tocotrinols are more potent.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=266s)** — They're a lot more expensive. Tocopherols you can get in a lot of different foods.
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=270s)** — It's easy to get it. But tocotrinols, it's harder to get tocotrinols. There's a
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=275s)** — source called aneto, but I don't think many people consume aneto. You'd have
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=279s)** — to get that as a supplement. Probably the biggest source of tocotrinols is in palm oil.
- **[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=285s)** — I'm not talking about the refined version, but sometimes you can find a red palm oil or
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=291s)** — unrefined palm oil. It's loaded with tocotrinols. It's also a good source of tocopherols as well.
- **[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=297s)** — It's like 70% tocotrinols and 30% tocopherols. There is some data, I don't know if this is true,
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=304s)** — where if you take both tocotrinols and tocopherols together, they tend to compete.
- **[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=309s)** — I don't know if that's true. I think over time we're going to see a lot more interesting
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=313s)** — things about these tocotrinols. There's more research being done on this. There's research
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=317s)** — heavy into the areas of helping unblock arteries. What you also have to realize too, in nature,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=324s)** — vitamin E doesn't just work by itself. It works together with vitamin C. It works with
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=329s)** — other nutrition. These antioxidants are recycled over and over again. For example, you're really
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=336s)** — focused on vitamin E, but you're deficient in vitamin C. You can create a problem with that
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=340s)** — because they both need each other to help recharge each other. I know sometimes people
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=346s)** — want to know what brand you recommend. I don't have a brand. I take a high-quality tocotrinol
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=352s)** — blend. I usually take it right after I work out. I definitely feel a difference from that.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=357s)** — A lot of times when people take vitamins, they don't necessarily feel a difference because
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=361s)** — they're working a lot deeper. That's why a better understanding about nutrition helps you
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=366s)** — understand what you should be taking or what you shouldn't be taking based on
- **[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=370s)** — your particular weaknesses or problems you're trying to solve. I have a lot of inflammatory
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm15-Tftb8E&t=375s)** — genes going on. I'm always trying to mitigate that. Anyway, thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.
