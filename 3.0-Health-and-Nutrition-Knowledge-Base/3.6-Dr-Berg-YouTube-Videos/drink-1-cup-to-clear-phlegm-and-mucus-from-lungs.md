- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk... excuse me... Today we are going to talk about how to get
- **[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=8s)** — rid of phlegm that is stuck in your lungs. Now, far too often people reach for over-the-counter
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=16s)** — medications and they wonder why those treatments don't work and sometimes even have side
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=22s)** — effects. Now, there are two categories that these medications fit into. You have medications
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=26s)** — that suppress this mucus and then you have medications that pull mucus out. That's called
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=32s)** — an expectrant. And of course, anytime you suppress mucus or a cough, you may end up
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=39s)** — having that infection a lot longer and then you may also weaken your immune system.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=45s)** — Plus, you might have some slight minor complications or side effects like vomiting, nausea,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=52s)** — diarrhea, constipation, and kidney stones. Now, other than that, totally fine. And I'm
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=58s)** — describing the one medication that is an FDA approved expectrant. All the other ones
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=63s)** — are things that suppress mucus. So, of course, I think the best thing to do is to look
- **[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=68s)** — for a natural remedy which I'm going to talk about right now. But I do want to
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=72s)** — mention it's important to exercise your lungs if you have this mucus that's trapped
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=77s)** — down into the lower part of your lungs. In other words, you might want to try alternating
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=82s)** — breathing through your chest, deep breaths through the nose, and also then stomach breathing
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=90s)** — where you're pumping the diaphragm up and down so you can mobilize some of this
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=94s)** — mucus. Another important thing to eat a lot of if you can do this is radishes.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=101s)** — Radishes tend to pull mucus from the deeper tissues in your body. Also, as a
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=107s)** — mucus, but you have this dry cough, the usual remedy for that that usually works
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=111s)** — like almost 100% of the time is calcium. Any type of calcium. You just take it and
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=117s)** — it will tend to help get rid of that dry cough. Great for kids as well as adults.
- **[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=123s)** — In fact, one of the medications out there for blood pressure called a calcium channel
- **[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=129s)** — blocker works by blocking calcium and the side effect from that is coughing.
- **[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=135s)** — Okay, so in this combination remedy, it just involves three simple ingredients in
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=140s)** — water. Onion, honey, and lemon. Let's start off with onions. Onions are
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=149s)** — basically a natural thinner of mucus. They're a natural, a very effective
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=155s)** — mucus expectant. They will help suppress a cough. They, especially if
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=164s)** — mucus, just like a radishes. Yes, you can eat onions, but you also can juice onions.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=169s)** — If you don't have a juicer, what you do is you get a grater and you grate the onions
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=174s)** — in a little bowl. You put that then in a strainer with some maybe paper towel and you
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=180s)** — push the juice out of it. And all you really need is one tablespoon of this onion juice.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=186s)** — And that's basically 14.7 milliliters for those people in Europe. Onions are also one
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=192s)** — of the highest sources of quercetin. Now quercetin is a natural antihistamine and it has
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=199s)** — no side effects. So it's really good for allergies and mucus production and inflammation.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=207s)** — And it calms down an overactive immune system. So we're going to combine this onion juice
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=212s)** — with the next thing on the list, which is honey. Now, if you can get the manuka honey,
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=217s)** — a little bit better, but any of the raw honeys will work. Honey has been a known great remedy
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=223s)** — to suppress coughing, to help as a natural expectant, to help with mucus as an anti-microbial,
- **[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=231s)** — anti-inflammatory. I mean, think about what these bees do. They go around to all of these
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=235s)** — flowering trees and plants and they pull out the nectar. And with that comes a lot of
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=243s)** — pollen. So we have all these factors that can help your own immune system. It's even considered
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=249s)** — like a natural antibiotic of your respiratory system. I mean, they use the manuka honey on
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=255s)** — open wounds to help heal like bed sores. And manuka honey, if you can get it, has this
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=261s)** — additional X factor. It's called MgO. And this is a chemical that is a very powerful
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=267s)** — anti-microbial. But like I said before, you can use any raw honey. It will work. Honey
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=271s)** — also has naturally hydrogen peroxide, which is good to kill pathogens. But for upper respiratory
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=277s)** — infections like the sinus and lower respiratory infections, it's an effective remedy. And we're
- **[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=283s)** — going to use one tablespoon. That is 14.7 milliliters. So we take these first two
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=290s)** — ingredients. We mix it with the third ingredient, which is lemon juice. So with the lemon juice,
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=294s)** — you want to use two tablespoons, which is 29.4 milliliters. And the citric acid in the lemon
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=301s)** — juice will actually break up mucus. The vitamin C will help the immune system. And lemon is like
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=307s)** — this sour, somewhat bitter substance, which is great to kind of thin the mucus and also cause
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=314s)** — the mucus to kind of come up so you can get it out of the body. Now you want to add these
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=318s)** — three ingredients to a cup of water and you want to drink this three times a day. Now if
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=323s)** — you want to add a couple additional things, I would add a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar
- **[05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=328s)** — and you can even add some ginger. But this is actually a no-brainer, very simple,
- **[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=333s)** — virtually no side effect type remedy for getting rid of mucus. Now there are other causes of
- **[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=339s)** — mucus that need different solutions. Like if you have GERD, where you're having acid
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=347s)** — reflux coming up through this your valve on the top of the stomach. If you haven't seen my
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HmU8O5_EQ&t=352s)** — video on that, which actually got over, I think, five million views, I put that up right here. Check it out.
