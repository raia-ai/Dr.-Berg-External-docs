- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=0s)** — I want to show you how to clear out your respiratory mucus, which includes bronchitis, mucus with
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=5s)** — pneumonia, sinusitis, any mucus in your respiratory system, with something better than salt.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=11s)** — Now, I've done quite a few videos on using salt to get rid of mucus, and it's good,
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=15s)** — but there's something much better. And that remedy is NAC. NAC is also used in hospitals
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=22s)** — and emergency rooms as the antidote to Tylenol poisoning. The benefits of NAC go
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=28s)** — way beyond mucus, which I'm going to cover, but let's just focus on what it does to your
- **[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=32s)** — mucus. NAC basically thins your mucus. It makes your mucus less sticky. Salt will do
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=40s)** — that as well by absorbing water into the mucus, but NAC takes it one step further.
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=45s)** — It's a very potent anti-inflammatory. It also is a very potent antioxidant. Not
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=51s)** — only does it thin the mucus, but it also stops the production of mucus. It strengthens
- **[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=55s)** — the little hairs, the cilia, in your respiratory system that helps move mucus. And not only that,
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=61s)** — it's antibacterial, antiviral, and it can even break up something called biofilms,
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=67s)** — which are certain micro colonies that live within the mucus that are protected sometimes
- **[01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=72s)** — by either calcium or other things. And there's three ways that you can take NAC. You can
- **[01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=77s)** — take it orally as a supplement. You can get it injected. Certain doctors do that. Or you
- **[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=82s)** — can inhale it through a nebulizer. I'm going to get into a little more details in a little
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=86s)** — bit on how to take it. And the reason I'm putting this NAC on your radar is because
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=90s)** — it does a lot. You can use it for many different things. Whether you have mucus
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=94s)** — from an infection or you have something called CLPD, which is chronic obstructive pulmonary
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=100s)** — disease where the lungs are generating a lot of mucus or even a genetic condition
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=105s)** — that involves the lung and mucus called cystic fibrosis, NAC can come to the rescue.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=110s)** — And so let's first touch on what it does for Tylenol poisoning. When someone takes too much
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=115s)** — Tylenol, what it's going to do is going to produce this chemical that's going to deplete
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=120s)** — glutathione. And without glutathione, your liver goes right down the tubes. You develop
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=124s)** — liver damage and the liver can literally shut down. NAC helps build up glutathione in the
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=131s)** — liver to protect the liver from breaking down. Now, why can't you just take glutathione?
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=136s)** — It just doesn't work. You want to take a precursor to help build up your own glutathione
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=142s)** — in your liver. The other very interesting thing about NAC is it helps enhance brain function
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=148s)** — because it crosses the blood brain barrier and it can act as a very powerful antioxidant
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=152s)** — in the brain as well. So there's some pretty positive research on using NAC for Alzheimer's,
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=158s)** — Parkinson's, obsessive compulsive disorder, certain addictions to cocaine, marijuana,
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=164s)** — and even gambling, depression, schizophrenia. And just as a side note, if you know someone
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=169s)** — with schizophrenia, give them high doses of niacinamide. That's another remedy for
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=175s)** — schizophrenia. NAC also apparently improves insulin sensitivity. So what would that mean?
- **[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=181s)** — That means your blood sugars are going to do much better. You're not going to develop a
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=186s)** — fatty liver from all that insulin. You're going to probably end up with lower blood pressure
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=190s)** — and better cholesterol profiles. So in other words, you'll have less oxidative LDL. Also,
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=196s)** — people with asthma take NAC. And as another side note with that, if you have asthma,
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=203s)** — you're going to also benefit from high doses of vitamin D3. There's even immune benefits
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=208s)** — from NAC. Certain people with HIV take NAC with good results. And even if you have a
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=215s)** — toxicity, apparently NAC can act as a chelator to bind the mercury and pull it out of the body.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=222s)** — If we compare salt for mucus versus NAC for mucus, salt is good for acute infections,
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=229s)** — like some quick results with your mucus. But NAC goes a lot deeper. It handles not just the
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=236s)** — mucus, but the inflammation behind the mucus, also the oxidative stress. It can kind of put
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=241s)** — fire out with that. And it can even help modulate or regulate the immune system. NAC,
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=246s)** — if we do a comparison, is just much better for anything related to mucus in your respiratory
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=251s)** — system. There's even reports that NAC is good for fibromyalgia and also improving eye problems
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=257s)** — with certain types of autoimmune diseases. And there's also things you can take in addition
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=262s)** — to NAC to speed things up. Let me just list the things that can enhance the NAC effects.
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=268s)** — If you add vitamin C or curcumin in turmeric, a probiotic can be very beneficial. Magnesium can
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=274s)** — help the airways because it's a vasor relaxor. And also you can add quercetin, which is a
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=280s)** — phytonutrient that's usually in onions. But of course, I think one of the biggest things I
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=284s)** — would add is the vitamin D. And about 20,000 I use. Vitamin D is hands down one of the most
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=290s)** — powerful things to help regulate the immune system so you don't even get this infection
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=295s)** — the first place. And if you do, you can overcome the infection pretty quick. Now, as far as the
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=301s)** — NAC dosage, I would recommend taking 600 milligrams three times a day. That would be your dosage.
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=308s)** — And the percentage of this liquid NAC would be anywhere between 10 to 20 percent. And you'd
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=315s)** — use that in a nebulizer to create a mist to put it into your sinuses, inhale it so it
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=321s)** — goes down the respiratory tract and into the lungs. However, taking the Orally also does work.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=327s)** — You don't necessarily have to use a nebulizer. I wanted to make this video fairly short,
- **[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=332s)** — to the point, no fluff. And since vitamin D is so important with respiratory infections,
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxPLWR1U5D0&t=338s)** — you should probably watch this video right here.
