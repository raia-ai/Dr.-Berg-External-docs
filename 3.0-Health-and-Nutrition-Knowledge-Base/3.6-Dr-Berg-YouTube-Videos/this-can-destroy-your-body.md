- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=0s)** — You must know this. So this presentation is an intriguing talk about viruses.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=7s)** — A virus is dead. It's not alive. Yet it can destroy your body.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=12s)** — So let me just show you something. This is a cell. If we open up the cell,
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=16s)** — it has a bunch of things in it. Okay, you can see it has all these different... they're called
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=19s)** — organelles. They're just little tiny parts of this huge factory that makes stuff. Okay,
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=26s)** — you have the mitochondria in here, which is the energy factory. You have the ribosome,
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=30s)** — which is basically a protein factory. And then you have the nucleus right in the center here.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=34s)** — Well, guess what? Viruses don't have any of this stuff right here. In fact,
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=39s)** — viruses are not even cells. A virus is just some blueprints with the sac around it that
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=46s)** — has no energy, no machine. It cannot do anything outside your cell. Today, we're going
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=52s)** — to get into some potential theories on where viruses really came from. It's really interesting.
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=59s)** — And viruses on one hand can kill you, but on the other hand, they can actually really help
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=64s)** — you. And I'm going to get into that as well. But to understand viruses, you have to just get
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=67s)** — a little bit of a foundation of what they are and what they're not. Viruses are not cells.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=73s)** — They're very tiny things that compare to the cell. So they come in contact with a cell,
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=76s)** — and it's like a lock and a key. Something gets inserted like a spike protein,
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=81s)** — and it just activates something that then causes a chain reaction in your body, which involves the
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=89s)** — hijacking of your machinery. So they basically can tap into your energy, use your resources,
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=97s)** — not theirs, for their survival. And then they start to reproduce and make more of themselves.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=103s)** — And then they explode your cell. Okay, they're not nice. They're classified as parasitic. Now,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=109s)** — before I get into some of the theories on where viruses came from, which is a huge mystery,
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=116s)** — I want to just cover some ways that these viruses evade your immune system. There's one
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=121s)** — type of virus. They rupture the cell membrane. They disintegrate it. They're called lytic
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=126s)** — viruses. And then the other type of viruses are called latent viruses. So they also
- **[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=132s)** — destroy your cell. But soon after the initial infection, they invade your DNA and they go
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=140s)** — silent. And then one day you get a little bit older and you go through stress and bam,
- **[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=144s)** — they come out of remission and they become reactivated. Like herpes simplex, like that
- **[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=149s)** — little blister you get on your lip is one example. HIV is another example. Epstein
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=154s)** — virus is another one. So the problem with the latent viruses is they pretty much last
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=159s)** — a very long time in your body and they never go away. And as long as you don't experience
- **[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=164s)** — a lot of stress or poor health, you might be okay. But the lytic viruses do their destruction
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=170s)** — and the immune system eventually takes care of them and wipes them out. It's just wild that
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=175s)** — these viruses even exist in the first place. Where did they come from? And why are they
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=180s)** — here? The first one is called the virus first hypothesis. In this theory, the virus has been
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=186s)** — thought to come before even our cells existed. Another theory is called reduction theory. In this
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=192s)** — area, the virus is some type of remnants or residual something from some living cell. So
- **[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=199s)** — it's lost its ability to survive independently. And so it must need another cell to tap into
- **[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=205s)** — its energy. Then you get this other theory is called the giant virus and the fourth domain.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=210s)** — This really has challenged the traditional theory of viruses because a giant virus is a lot
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=217s)** — more complex. And the theory goes that viruses are a fourth domain. So you have different
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=223s)** — types of cells. You have bacteria cells, you have other cells. It's not really a cell,
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=227s)** — it's just an entity. Then you get this next theory that has to do with contribution to
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=232s)** — evolution or having something evolve. And this theory goes like this. You have this thing
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=237s)** — called horizontal gene transfer. It's kind of like sharing knowledge, key knowledge to help
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=243s)** — someone survive. You can pass down knowledge from you to your children. In fact, 8% of our
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=250s)** — genes have viral components. Then the last theory has to do with viruses being a necessary
- **[04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=257s)** — tool to help with survival. Now those are all the theories that are known. There's a couple
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=268s)** — for your immune system. So in the immune system, you have two types. You have the type of immune
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=274s)** — system that you were born with. It's called the innate. Your mother gave it to you. But you also
- **[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=278s)** — have another part of an immune system called the acquired immune system. This is the part
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=284s)** — that you need to develop over time. And you cannot develop it without viruses. And they cause
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=290s)** — your immune system to adapt and become very, very strong if you let this process happen. So
- **[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=296s)** — this is why I've done videos on this where, like with a child, when they get sick and they have a
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=301s)** — fever, their response is just to stop the fever. And through a series of infections,
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=307s)** — that immune system gets trained. If we never let our immune system get trained, it can never
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=313s)** — develop and become strong. Viruses have given us the evolutionary pressure to develop this
- **[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=318s)** — robust immune system. This could relate to just exercise, right? If you've never exercised
- **[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=323s)** — how strong are you really going to be? Can you actually really build up this fitness reserve?
- **[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=329s)** — No, not without exercise. And so this side will develop strategies to help them survive. And then
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=335s)** — our bodies will also develop other strategies. So they're sitting there waiting and waiting
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=340s)** — for their door to open for you to get weak. Now other viruses like the Epstein-Barr virus,
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=345s)** — for example, there's many of these that do this, but the Epstein-Barr virus downgrades
- **[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=350s)** — your vitamin D receptor. Because somehow it knows that vitamin D is really essential for
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=357s)** — the entire immune system. So I just have to explain something about vitamin D that's super
- **[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=362s)** — important. A lot of people don't know about this. In fact, most doctors do not know that
- **[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=367s)** — there's two different systems for vitamin D. And there's three different types of vitamin D.
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=373s)** — You have the vitamin D that comes from the sun. And then you also have the vitamin D that
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=380s)** — gets activated inside the receptors wherever it goes. So there's two systems of vitamin D.
- **[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=388s)** — One is all about calcium in bone. And the other system is about everything else. It's non-calcium
- **[06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=395s)** — functions. The immune system is the big one. The most important thing that you need to know
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=400s)** — is the vitamin D in the blood is in an inactive form. And this is mainly to feed
- **[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=407s)** — the bone. A very tiny bit of it, like 0.04% of it, feeds the immune system. So if you want a
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=416s)** — strong immune system, but you're not getting daily amounts of either sun or the supplement
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=421s)** — or vitamin D in from the food, your immune system is going to suffer because the half-life
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=426s)** — is 24 hours. For the bone, you can get by with like 600 to 800 IUs. But for the immune
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=434s)** — system, you need a minimum amount of 10,000 IUs. 10,000 IUs would be basically 20 minutes
- **[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=440s)** — in the sun. But the average person needs 10,000 IUs every single day to support a healthy immune
- **[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=447s)** — system. Then you also have many viruses, including the rhinoviruses, which gives you
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=452s)** — the common cold. They need zinc and your immune system needs zinc too, because zinc also
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=458s)** — turns down virus reproduction. And then you have another virus called HIV. What that does is it
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=464s)** — targets this very specific immune cell that is like the quarterback of the entire immune
- **[07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=470s)** — system. And it takes that one out. One way to counter that, just as a side note, is selenium.
- **[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=477s)** — Selenium is in Brazil nuts. It's also in shellfish. And if you have enough selenium,
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=482s)** — you can reactivate that cell and get it to work right. So now I want to just touch briefly
- **[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=486s)** — on what reactivates certain viruses that are latent or in remission. As you age, you become
- **[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=493s)** — weaker. And also the more stress you have, the more cortisol you have, the weaker you're going to
- **[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=499s)** — become. So cortisol suppresses your immune system. In practice, I notice a lot of people that had
- **[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=506s)** — viral infections had them right after a severe stress. And then other viruses can be
- **[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=512s)** — reactivated through ultraviolet radiation, the sunlight. But the secret to this entire
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=517s)** — presentation is what can we do about viruses? You have two specific types of immune cells that
- **[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=525s)** — kill off viruses. One is called the cytotoxic T cell. The other one is called the natural
- **[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=531s)** — killer cell. Both of these can be greatly strengthened. And I'm going to go through a
- **[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=535s)** — list of all the things that you can do. Vitamin D is hands down the most important
- **[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=543s)** — immune system. It's a natural immune modulator. It means that if your immune system is
- **[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=549s)** — working too much or too slow or not enough, it'll bring it to normal. Number two is zinc.
- **[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=556s)** — I already talked about that. Zinc increases the immune system many different ways. One way,
- **[09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=561s)** — it counteracts this whole viral shutdown of your zinc supply. Another way is zinc just stops
- **[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=566s)** — the reproduction of viruses. Then of course, you have vitamin C, right? The best vitamin C
- **[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=571s)** — you can eat is raw sauerkraut. One cup of that a few times a week would give you 700mg
- **[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=578s)** — of vitamin C. Sleep is another important thing. Try like heck to get eight hours of sleep.
- **[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=583s)** — I was at one time bragging because I didn't need much sleep. I can get by, I can get
- **[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=588s)** — up really early. That was a very stupid thing to brag about because I'm telling you,
- **[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=593s)** — seven, eight hours of sleep is a necessity. Number five, the reduction of stress,
- **[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=597s)** — whether it's physical work, going for a walk in nature, doing stretches is very, very important.
- **[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=603s)** — Also, if you have a fever, don't try to get rid of it right away. Why? Because fever cooks
- **[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=610s)** — the virus. And so when you take some type of thing like an aspirin or whatever to try to
- **[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=614s)** — get rid of the fever, now you prolong the infection. You don't allow the body to run
- **[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=620s)** — through its training cycle of fighting off the infection. But if your fever gets above 104F,
- **[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=629s)** — just 40 degrees Celsius, at that point, maybe you do something, but not at lower temperatures.
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=635s)** — Number six, garlic. Very important. Number seven, elderberry. Awesome for viruses.
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=641s)** — Intermittent fasting. Very powerful. Also, magnesium helps increase the killer T cells. I
- **[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=647s)** — recently stumbled on information. So one way to strengthen the immune system is to take about
- **[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=651s)** — 800 milligrams in the evening before you go to bed. Believe it or not, laughter can also increase
- **[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=657s)** — these killer T cells. Viruses outside your cells are powerless. They can't do anything.
- **[11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=662s)** — They just float around. They have no energy, no mechanics. So this is why it's important to
- **[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=667s)** — understand that you need to go through infections to build up your immune system,
- **[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=672s)** — and you need the key nutrition to support and strengthen the immune system itself. Versus the
- **[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=677s)** — other viewpoint, which is not true, where you have a virus that is alive, which is not true,
- **[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=683s)** — and it's controlling your body. It's stronger than your body. It goes into your body. And
- **[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=688s)** — at all costs, you just need to suppress and try to kill it off. There's all sorts of
- **[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jf5NRwKBM&t=693s)** — medications, which ends up weakening your immune system. So remember this concept and apply it to your lifestyle.
