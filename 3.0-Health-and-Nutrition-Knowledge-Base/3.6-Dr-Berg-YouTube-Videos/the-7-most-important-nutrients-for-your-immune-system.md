- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=0s)** — Many times we have this idea that we just need to increase more protein to build our muscles because
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=6s)** — after all muscles are made out of protein, right? But then when a lot of people do this it doesn't
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=11s)** — always work. So in fact there's actually a paradox involved here. Some people that eat
- **[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=16s)** — more protein might even suffer from an individual amino acid deficiency. So whether you're trying
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=22s)** — to prevent muscle loss as you're getting older, that's called sarcopenia, or whether you're
- **[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=28s)** — increase more muscle, I want to talk about some other factors that are not related directly to
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=34s)** — protein consumption. Even though you do need sufficient protein consumption to build muscles,
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=40s)** — but more than that you need sufficient amount of amino acids. Now when you look up the minimum
- **[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=45s)** — amount of protein you need, there's a lot of conflicting information out there. But the general
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=52s)** — consensus is you need 0.8 grams per kilogram of lean body weight. Not your overall weight. So
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=61s)** — let's say for example you weigh like 400 pounds and you have a lot of extra fat. It doesn't
- **[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=65s)** — mean you should start massively increasing your protein. You should calculate that based on
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=70s)** — your lean body mass. So 0.8 grams per kilogram of lean body mass is kind of like on the low
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=76s)** — that's like the minimum amount. And that on average could be around 50 grams of protein
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=84s)** — per day. Now when I say protein, I'm talking about the protein in your food. For example,
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=90s)** — if you take a steak and you have like 100 grams of steak, right, the weight of it,
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=95s)** — that only has roughly about 26 grams of protein in that 100 gram steak. So it's the
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=103s)** — in the food, not the actual weight of the food. Now a moderate amount of protein could be between
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=109s)** — like 1.2 and 1.7 grams per kilogram of lean body weight. And then when we get into higher
- **[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=115s)** — protein, that's roughly about like two grams per kilogram of lean body weight. And a lot of
- **[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=121s)** — weight lifters will do that amount and even a lot more too. So but I'm not going to get into
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=126s)** — whether you should do that or not do that. I'm just kind of giving you some ideas on the
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=131s)** — how much protein you should have. But I want to really focus on these other factors that
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=137s)** — influence the production of muscle protein itself. Now, and a couple points I want to even
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=143s)** — touch on is your body doesn't normally store a lot of protein as like a reserve. Okay,
- **[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=147s)** — so it doesn't store that. So if you eat too much protein, it'll just convert the excess
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=153s)** — into glucose. Bodybuilders sometimes like that because sometimes they want to increase
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=159s)** — insulin effects from glucose because insulin is anabolic and they want to build their muscle mass.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=165s)** — And if they're fortunate enough not to have insulin resistance and maybe they're immune to
- **[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=171s)** — it or whatever versus the rest of us that have insulin resistance, that may work for them. But
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=176s)** — for the majority of the population when they start increasing more sugar, glucose, or even
- **[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=182s)** — glucose from protein and thereby increasing more insulin, the body tends to now create
- **[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=187s)** — So it's kind of a catch-22. Here you're trying to increase more insulin, but the more you try
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=192s)** — to do it, the more you're creating insulin resistance to the point where now you have a deficiency
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=198s)** — of insulin. Okay, that's what insulin resistance is. So how does that affect your muscles? Well,
- **[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=204s)** — guess what? You need insulin to absorb amino acids. So the more insulin resistance you have,
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=211s)** — the less ability you're going to be able to use these proteins for your own muscles.
- **[03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=217s)** — So that's barrier number one, insulin resistance. How was that created? By eating too many carbs.
- **[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=223s)** — And it could be also created by consuming too much protein too. So on the flip side, if we
- **[03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=227s)** — want to correct insulin resistance, we want to get on a low carb diet. We want to not eat as
- **[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=232s)** — frequently. And this is the other point I want to bring up about protein. So many people
- **[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=238s)** — have this idea that they have to be constantly eating protein when they're working out
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=243s)** — before or after or even during having these protein powders and these shakes and these bars.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=250s)** — But in fact, that's going to actually rebound on the person many times because it's going to
- **[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=254s)** — act as a snack. It's going to increase insulin, but create more insulin resistance.
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=258s)** — And it's really not needed for many reasons, but definitely insulin resistance is one reason.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=264s)** — The other factor involved with building muscles is growth hormone. And there are some things
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=270s)** — you want to know about growth hormone. How do you first trigger growth hormone? Well,
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=274s)** — you can trigger it by intense exercise. So if you're trying to build muscle with just eating
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=279s)** — protein and not exercising, it's not going to work. Exercise is the most potent activator of
- **[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=286s)** — muscle synthesis, especially intense exercise, as well as the volume of exercise too. So it's
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=293s)** — not just doing a short little intense workout. It's really increasing the volume and the load
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=298s)** — the muscles doing like resistance type exercise. But exercise will stimulate growth hormone.
- **[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=304s)** — And it also stimulates testosterone too. Both necessary for building muscle. Now,
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=310s)** — another thing that you can do to increase growth hormone is fasting, right? Fasting and not
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=315s)** — snacking so frequently. So fasting can increase growth hormone. And if you're trying to build
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=321s)** — muscle, I would just do intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting, not eat so frequently.
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=325s)** — Eat two meals a day. I think that would be a lot better than three meals a day. Now with
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=330s)** — intermittent fasting, your hunger will go down. So you just want to make sure that you have
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=334s)** — enough calories too. Because especially if you have a fast metabolism, growth hormone also can
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=340s)** — be inhibited by high blood glucose levels. That's why I like the low carb. I like
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=348s)** — intermittent fasting and a good exercise plan. As well as a good amount of recovery from sleep.
- **[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=357s)** — All of those factors can help increase growth hormone. Now as far as testosterone goes,
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=363s)** — there's several things you need to be aware of. Zinc deficiency can create a low
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=368s)** — testosterone. Zinc can definitely increase your testosterone. Now where do you get zinc from?
- **[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=373s)** — Red meat, shellfish, seafood. Way more than plant type foods. How do you create a zinc deficiency?
- **[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=382s)** — By eating too many refined carbs, too much sugar, going through stress. The other thing that
- **[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=387s)** — can inhibit testosterone is having too much estrogen. Now where does that come from? Well,
- **[06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=393s)** — mainly comes from a lot of the soy protein isolate foods. Soy milk can do it. You also
- **[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=400s)** — increase estrogen when you drink beer. Okay, yeah, and also consume alcohol. Now another way to
- **[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=408s)** — create a problem with amino acids is to consume foods low in certain amino acids. Like plant
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=416s)** — based proteins. Whether you're a vegetarian or a vegan or consuming a lot of plant based
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=421s)** — protein which are considered clean proteins, many times are low in certain amino acids.
- **[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=426s)** — One amino acid that I want to bring up is leucine. Leucine is a potent stimulus of the
- **[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=434s)** — production of muscle. So mostly you're going to see low leucine foods in plant based foods.
- **[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=441s)** — You're not going to see this in animal meats, things like that. So it's the type of protein
- **[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=445s)** — that's important too. Eggs, meat, fish, dairy. All very, very important. Now another factor is
- **[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=452s)** — stress. Stress produces cortisol. Cortisol is very catabolic. That's the opposite of anabolic.
- **[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=458s)** — So it tends to break things down. If you're under chronic stress, that can wear your muscles
- **[07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=464s)** — down big time. Primarily it starts out in the thigh muscle, the quadricep, and then it goes
- **[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=469s)** — after the glutamous maximus and it can convert some of that protein into sugar which
- **[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=476s)** — then is converted to fat around your midsection. Okay, so that's just another factor to be aware
- **[08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=482s)** — of. Another factor is the microbiome. Microbiome is definitely involved in helping you make
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=488s)** — amino acids and other factors in helping you make protein in general. And so if someone had
- **[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=495s)** — a lot of antibiotics, many times they start having all sorts of problems with their muscles,
- **[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=501s)** — building muscles, and maintaining muscles. So consuming more probiotic foods like fermented
- **[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=508s)** — foods like sauerkraut, things like that, that are very, very good. Now the other thing that I've
- **[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=514s)** — run into with people is that they just don't have enough stomach acid to break down the
- **[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=517s)** — protein. They then turn into muscle. So they never have this fully broke down protein
- **[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=524s)** — product into the amino acids. So hydrochloric acid is very, very important, especially as
- **[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=529s)** — we age. The stomach acid goes down. So you need to start to support that so you get the
- **[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=534s)** — of amino acids. So butane hydrochloride is a really good thing to start taking with your meals to
- **[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=541s)** — enhance the amino acids into the muscle. How do you know if you have a problem or deficiency of
- **[09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=547s)** — hydrochloric acid? Well, one way is indigestion or acid reflux or GERD. If you have that,
- **[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=554s)** — you should watch the link down below. Now also enzymes. Enzymes mainly from the pancreas
- **[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=559s)** — and even from the small intestine can be a factor. If you don't have enough enzymes,
- **[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=563s)** — you're not going to be able to break down certain foods that then can turn into these
- **[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=568s)** — pure amino acids. So a couple things with the pancreas. You could have a like bile sludge that
- **[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=575s)** — can build up that can create pancreatitis. So that's a problem with the bile. And the way
- **[09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=580s)** — that you probably have that is you get a lot of bloating or you have referred pain to your
- **[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=585s)** — left or right shoulder. I put a link down below if you have that. Or you have some type
- **[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=591s)** — of malabsorption in your small intestine or your large intestine where there's inflammation
- **[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=595s)** — or past gut problems that have been really hindering your ability to absorb protein.
- **[10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=602s)** — In which case you might need to take an amino acid supplement. And then the other factor I
- **[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=608s)** — want to bring up is when you eat protein, right, you have to realize that the ideal protein
- **[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=613s)** — your body to absorb would be in its natural form with fat versus lean protein. Okay,
- **[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=622s)** — the leaner a protein is the harder it is to digest and the more problems it can create.
- **[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=626s)** — There's some interesting data on that in relationship to people eating just,
- **[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=630s)** — you know, very very lean protein and no fat and what that does to your bodies. There's a
- **[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=635s)** — lot of problems with that. So I recommend always consume the fat that normally comes with
- **[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=641s)** — protein if possible. Or if you're eating chicken, have the skin on it. Or fish,
- **[10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=645s)** — try to have the skin on it. That's much better. And this also includes like so many people are
- **[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=650s)** — doing this refined protein by having protein powders all the time. I mean a little bit of
- **[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=655s)** — that is okay, but if you're just relying exclusively on protein powders, it's not the
- **[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=660s)** — ideal scene to build healthy muscles. Especially since they put all this maltodextrin and this
- **[11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=666s)** — corn syrup in there and all sorts of crap. But in this video, I just wanted to go beyond
- **[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=671s)** — this dietary protein and give you some other factors, especially if you're trying to build
- **[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=675s)** — muscle or prevent the loss of muscle as you age. Now, since I brought up growth hormone,
- **[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=681s)** — it's a really important topic. And if you haven't seen my video on growth hormone,
- **[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuO2FwBrmqY&t=684s)** — you should probably check that out. I put it up right here.
