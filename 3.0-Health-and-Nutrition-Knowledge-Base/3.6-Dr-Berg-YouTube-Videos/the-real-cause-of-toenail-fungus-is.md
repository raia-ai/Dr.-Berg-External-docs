- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=0s)** — The real underlying deeper cellular cause of autism involves
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=5s)** — oxidative stress to neurons leading to neuronal toxicity and inflammation.
- **[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=12s)** — Basically, there's inflammation in the brain and there's a lot of free radical damage, but there's
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=17s)** — not enough antioxidant protection to counter that.
- **[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=21s)** — Now, your body makes antioxidants and they can come from the diet.
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=25s)** — But I did a huge deep dive into this topic and I found some really interesting information
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=30s)** — on some common deficiencies with many people who have autism. Number one, they tend to have
- **[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=38s)** — low amounts of antioxidants. I already mentioned that, especially glutathione.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=42s)** — That's the master antioxidant in the body that does a tremendous amount of work in
- **[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=47s)** — protecting you and getting rid of toxicity and free radical damage. There's also low vitamin A,
- **[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=52s)** — there's low vitamin E, low vitamin D, there's low zinc, selenium, low magnesium, and low omega 3.
- **[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=62s)** — There's also mitochondrial dysfunction, which is not surprising because anytime you have oxidative
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=67s)** — stress, you're going to have problems in the mitochondria deep within the neuron. And there's
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=73s)** — also something called high homocysteine, which you may connect with heart problems, but in this
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=79s)** — case, it can create degenerative symptoms in the brain. And the solution for that is B12
- **[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=87s)** — in folate in a certain form, which I'll cover in a bit. And there's also amino acid
- **[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=94s)** — abnormalities, probably because of all the oxidation going on. These amino acids are
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=98s)** — really important because they actually the raw material for all the enzymes in the biochemical
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=103s)** — pathways. So based on that data, the best diet that I would recommend would be a version
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=109s)** — of the carnivore diet because that will eliminate so many potential allergic type reactions that
- **[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=116s)** — the person's having, including the gluten intolerance problem or a gluten allergy or a
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=122s)** — casein allergy or whatever, because a lot of people who have autism have food allergies and
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=128s)** — that creates more oxidative stress. So anything we can do to take the load off this oxidative
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=133s)** — stress by eliminating any potential allergic type things is going to be really good. And
- **[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=138s)** — within that carnivore diet, I would include eggs, okay, because you're going to get a lot of
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=143s)** — vitamin A in the egg yolk, as well as other minerals and vitamins. I would also include
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=150s)** — seafood and even shellfish, even though there might be a little bit more higher mercury. You're
- **[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=156s)** — also at the same time going to get higher levels of selenium and zinc and other trace
- **[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=162s)** — minerals, which are very protective against these heavy metals. I would also include Oregon
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=168s)** — meats like beef liver. If you don't like liver, either get a good recipe or camouflage it
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=176s)** — in hamburger or take grass fed liver pills, because not only does liver have pretty much
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=183s)** — everything that I mentioned, including B12 and folate and zinc and selenium, but it's also a
- **[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=192s)** — mentioned and it has something else coq10. That is very, very powerful for the mitochondria,
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=201s)** — and that can be extremely helpful. What I'm trying to do in this protocol is instead of
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=206s)** — loading up with a lot of different vitamins, I'm trying to include the foods that contain
- **[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=211s)** — those vitamins so you wouldn't have to take every single nutrient. Now the tweak to this
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=215s)** — carnivore diet, which will make it not quite carnivore, it's going to make it more
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=220s)** — of a ketogenic plan because we're going to add a little bit of carbs, but not too much.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=226s)** — You would add microgreens or sprouts. Now if you could find microgreens grown in soil,
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=233s)** — that would be the ultimate why. Because these baby plants, roughly about seven to ten days,
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=242s)** — are some of the most vital nutrient, antioxidant rich things that you can possibly
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=246s)** — eat. And some of them are loaded with sulforaphane, which is an effective known remedy for
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=252s)** — autism. Microgreens and sprouts are basically antioxidants on steroids. Now to build up
- **[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=258s)** — glutathione, there's two things. You have a remedy called NAC, which helps indirectly
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=265s)** — build up glutathione, and selenium. Now you could take selenium as a supplement, or if
- **[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=270s)** — you're doing shellfish or seafood, you're going to get a good amount of selenium. Now
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=274s)** — another really important remedy would be cod liver oil. Why? Because it's the perfect EPA, DHA,
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=282s)** — omega-3s, as well as vitamin A and vitamin D. And the person who has autism might need more
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=289s)** — vitamin D, in which case the best thing to do is to expose themselves to a lot of sun,
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=295s)** — without getting burnt. They can't do that, like in the winter. Then take a good vitamin D3
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=303s)** — supplement, at least 10,000 IUs per day. Probably more, like maybe even 20,000 IUs.
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=311s)** — That's going to act as a very potent anti-inflammatory. Now if you're not
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=315s)** — doing the beef liver because you don't like liver, or you're not going to do the pills,
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=319s)** — then I recommend that you get the type of B12 and folate that can help lower homocysteine
- **[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=325s)** — and greatly help this condition. The form of B12 that you need to take is called
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=330s)** — methylcobalamin, not the cyanocobalamin that many people take that they don't realize it's
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=335s)** — just a synthetic version. It's not the right one. And then the type of folate they need is
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=340s)** — something called methylfolate, not folic acid. Now as far as coenzyme Q10, you could get that
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=346s)** — in organ meats, but it is a very effective measure to improve your mitochondria. So you
- **[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=353s)** — may want to add that to the list with this extra thing called methylene blue. You can order on
- **[06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=361s)** — Amazon or get it from the health food store. But methylene blue is very, very interesting.
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=366s)** — I've done videos about it. And depending on the age of the person, let's say they're
- **[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=369s)** — a child, I would recommend maybe 10 drops. It's a very small amount. If they're older,
- **[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=375s)** — maybe take 20 drops. And both 10 to 20 drops is a very small dosage. And you would put that
- **[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=380s)** — in a glass of water. You might want to add some electrolytes to it and sip it with a straw,
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=385s)** — because methylene blue can greatly help reduce the oxidative stress in the mitochondria,
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=391s)** — taking the pressure off the neurons, improving the symptoms of autism. So there you have it.
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=397s)** — That's the plan that I would recommend. And if you have not seen my video on
- **[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNfVJIthdyA&t=402s)** — furifane and autism, you should check that out. I put it up right here.
