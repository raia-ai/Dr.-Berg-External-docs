- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=0s)** — So today I went to the drug store to look for an antacid. I wanted to see if they had a special
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=6s)** — remedy in that section. And the remedy is zinc carnosine and I could not find it anywhere. In
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=13s)** — fact, I couldn't even find it under the vitamin section, which is shocking because zinc carnosine
- **[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=19s)** — is the cure for ulcers. That's probably because it's pretty cheap. I mean, I think it's probably
- **[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=25s)** — less than $10 a bottle. So today I'm going to talk about the mechanism of why zinc carnosine fixes an
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=33s)** — ulcer. And I have a lot of experience with this because in college I had severe heartburn and
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=41s)** — ulcers and I didn't know what to do. And I was suffering. So what I did is I just took
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=46s)** — massive amounts of Tums, which is chalk. Three hours later, I started to hurt again.
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=51s)** — And this cycle happened over and over and over. Taking tons of antibiotics or antacids doesn't
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=58s)** — really heal the problem. So the main treatment for an ulcer is an antibiotic. Why? Because
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=64s)** — fairly recently they discovered that the cause of ulcers is a bacteria called H. pylori. But
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=73s)** — they also use an H2 inhibitor. H standing for histamine, which I'm going to explain a little
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=79s)** — bit. But I think most of the medical profession initially thought that an ulcer was really just
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=86s)** — too much acid. Right? Well, now we know it's a breakdown of the mucus layer around part of
- **[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=95s)** — your stomach or the small intestine. And now you have this open wound and it can be infected.
- **[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=101s)** — Let's break down the zinc carnosine. So when you take the zinc carnosine, it's a pretty
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=106s)** — stable compound that doesn't really break down too easily. So it kind of stays in the stomach and
- **[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=112s)** — it kind of coats the area, but it eventually breaks down into zinc and carnosine.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=117s)** — Carnosine then breaks down into L-histidine. It's the amino acid that turns into histamine.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=124s)** — Now this is very confusing for a lot of people because when you think of histamines,
- **[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=128s)** — you think of anahistamine, a medication that you'd use for allergies or a mucus.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=133s)** — Histamine actually is released in the cells of the stomach that make hydrochloric acid.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=140s)** — And histamine helps regulate that hydrochloric acid. It actually helps increase that hydrochloric
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=148s)** — acid. So when you take an H2 blocker, you're basically blocking the production of histamine
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=154s)** — and you're lowering the amount of acid production in the stomach. Now let me just
- **[02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=163s)** — say 80% of the population and it's pretty harmless. It doesn't really do anything until
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=169s)** — the environment in your stomach changes. Then it starts to penetrate and create a hole in your
- **[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=176s)** — stomach. What it does is it releases this enzyme to help increase more production of
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=183s)** — ammonia. And so what this microbe is doing, it's changing the pH of your stomach,
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=190s)** — making it less acid and so it can survive. This is a survival mechanism. So make mental note of
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=197s)** — that because when you lose the stomach acid, you're more susceptible to having H pylori
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=202s)** — infections. Now I wonder if that's one reason why H pylori comes out of remission and creates
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=208s)** — damage in the first place. But the significance of this is that zinc blocks the enzyme that H
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=215s)** — is putting out there. It stops the production of ammonia so your stomach could be more acid.
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=222s)** — So the combination of zinc stopping this ammonia production and this increase of histamine
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=228s)** — increasing more acid is automatically going to cause that microbe to go back in remission
- **[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=234s)** — and stop creating a hole in your stomach. Zinc is also antibacterial and zinc also increases
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=241s)** — the production of that mucus in your stomach, that protective layer. Now I did mention that
- **[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=248s)** — carnasine breaks down into two additional things. One being histidine, which is the precursor
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=253s)** — for histamine, but another one is called beta-alanine. What does beta-alanine do? Well,
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=261s)** — it increases something called SOD, which is an antioxidant. So it's going to help reduce
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=267s)** — inflammation and it also supports the intestinal barrier. So you can imagine this L-carnasine is
- **[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=274s)** — like the perfect remedy to do a lot of things to help heal an ulcer and decrease gastritis
- **[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=279s)** — as well. Now there's a couple other interesting things about L-carnasine from a genetic
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=284s)** — standpoint. There is a certain type of genetic defect via polymorphism, which can put the
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=291s)** — at risk for getting an ulcer. So if someone has an ulcer, autism, or Tourette's or any ticks,
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=301s)** — I would also recommend zinc-carnasine. Now how much zinc-carnasine should you take? Well,
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=308s)** — I would recommend taking about 150 milligrams per day, broken up into two times a day. So you
- **[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=314s)** — take 75 milligrams in the morning, 75 milligrams in the evening, and that should be enough. You
- **[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=321s)** — want to take that for about one to three months. However, it doesn't work as fast as the medication.
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=327s)** — So what you might want to do is to use baking soda to kind of decrease the pain. And there's
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=334s)** — some other things you can do as well. You can take liquid chlorophyll on an empty stomach.
- **[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=340s)** — Chlorophyll is a great healer and it can definitely help not just with an ulcer,
- **[05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=345s)** — but also if there's irritation in your esophagus, it'll just kind of go down
- **[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=349s)** — and heal any type of lesions that you might have. Once you correct this ulcer,
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=355s)** — now the question is how do we prevent this problem from ever coming back?
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=359s)** — Well, for that you need a little knowledge on the stomach and stomach acid. And I have
- **[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE53pHQCPiA&t=364s)** — this video for that information.
