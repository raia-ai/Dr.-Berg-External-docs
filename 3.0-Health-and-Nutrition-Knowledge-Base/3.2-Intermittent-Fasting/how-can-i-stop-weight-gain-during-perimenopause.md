# How can I stop weight gain during perimenopause?

To prevent weight gain during perimenopause, especially around the midsection, consider gradually reducing your meal frequency until you reach one meal a day. This approach can help counteract the slower metabolism that often comes with age. Periodic longer fasts can also be highly effective in accelerating results. Additionally, closely monitor your calorie intake and aim to keep carbohydrates to a minimum for optimal results.
