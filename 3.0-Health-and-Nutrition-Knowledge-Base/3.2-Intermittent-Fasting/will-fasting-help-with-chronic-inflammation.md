# Will fasting help with chronic inflammation?

Inflammation serves to repair injuries and fight infections, but chronic inflammation, unlike acute inflammation, provides no long-term benefits and can cause various health issues such as scar tissue formation and insulin resistance. Chronic inflammation, often associated with autoimmune conditions, can be mitigated through fasting, which turns off inflammation-related genes and supports adrenal health. Intermittent fasting and longer fasts are recommended to reduce or eliminate inflammation, as fasting enhances the body's antioxidant network and overall resilience.
