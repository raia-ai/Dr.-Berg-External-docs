# How does intermittent fasting affect the gut flora?

Intermittent fasting is one of the best ways to ensure the health of your gut. When you begin fasting regularly, this helps your gut increase resistance to oxidative and xenobiotic stress. It also increases the diversity of microbes in the gut while helping tolerance for bad bacteria. If you struggle with a weak intestinal lining, fasting can help your body repair this as well. Regular fasting also helps reduce *Candida* infections and allows healthy gut microbes to live longer.
