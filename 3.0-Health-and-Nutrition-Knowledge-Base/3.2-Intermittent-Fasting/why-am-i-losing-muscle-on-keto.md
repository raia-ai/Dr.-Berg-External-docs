# Why am I losing muscle on keto?

This could be due to low protein in your diet and a lack of exercise.

When you donâ€™t want to lose muscle mass while doing intermittent fasting, add strength training as a part of your workout, loading up muscle to recruit as many muscle fibers as you can.

- Go heavy weight with a lower number of reps

- Go moderate amount of weight to failure

    Or you can do a combination of both the above. These two actions can create a hypertrophic effect on the muscles which can keep them bigger and prevent them from shrinking when you are doing keto and intermittent fasting.
