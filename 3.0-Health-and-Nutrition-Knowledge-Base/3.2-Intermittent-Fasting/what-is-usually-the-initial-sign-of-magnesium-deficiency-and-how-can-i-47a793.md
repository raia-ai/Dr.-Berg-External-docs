# What is usually the initial sign of magnesium deficiency, and how can it manifest in individuals?

The first sign of a magnesium deficiency is getting tired more easily when exercising.

**Aside from this symptom, you may also experience:**

• Poor memory

There are over 300 enzymes that depend on magnesium to function. 65% of patients in intensive care are magnesium deficient. It is estimated that over half of the world’s population is low on their RDAs of magnesium. If you’re doing intermittent fasting and you’re low on magnesium, the negative effects can be magnified. Also, keep in mind that 80% of alcoholics are magnesium deficient.
