# Can I consume high-fructose syrup?

**If you follow keto and an intermittent fasting plan – no.**

The problem with high-fructose corn syrup is that it is 53% glucose and 42% fructose–the rest is composed of different types of sugars. The fructose can do some serious damage to
the liver. All of your cells have receptors for glucose, but not fructose. Only your liver can break down fructose. If you consume a lot of fructose, you can overload the liver and create all sorts of health problems.

High fructose corn syrup is also made in a lab with cornstarch. Corn is GMO, so you’re getting that added glyphosate.

Thankfully, high-fructose corn syrup and even sugar are becoming less popular. This may have something to do with the awareness caused by the keto diet.
