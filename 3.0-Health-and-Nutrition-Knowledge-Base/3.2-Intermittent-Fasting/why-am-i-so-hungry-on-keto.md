# Why am I so hungry on Keto?

Increased hunger may indicate that your body has not yet fully adapted to ketosis. Itâ€™s important to assess your carbohydrate intake, as it may be too high, which can hinder your ability to enter fat-burning mode. Additionally, incorporating intermittent fasting could be beneficial, as it helps facilitate the transition to ketosis.

During the initial adaptation phase, some hunger is normal; however, as your body becomes more efficient at burning fat for energy, you should experience a reduction in hunger. This decrease in appetite is a key indicator that the ketogenic diet is effectively working for you. If your hunger persists, consider consulting a healthcare professional for further guidance.
