# How to Break a Prolonged Fast & Refeeding

**Understanding Refeeding Syndrome After Prolonged Fasting**

Prolonged fasting (4-7+ days) carries the risk of refeeding syndrome, a rare but potentially serious condition. This occurs when your body rapidly shifts nutrients from the bloodstream into cells, especially if you were already nutrient deficient before the fast.

**Why It Happens:** Pre-existing nutrient deficiencies worsen during a fast. When you suddenly reintroduce food, your body can experience dangerous imbalances. People with known vitamin deficiencies should avoid prolonged fasting.

**Prevention is Key:** During a prolonged fast, it's crucial to supplement with vitamins, electrolytes, and sea salt. This helps maintain balance and won't break your fast.

**Breaking Your Fast Safely:** Ease back into eating slowly with keto-friendly foods. Avoid carbohydrates, sugars, and non-keto foods, as they can worsen nutrient depletion. Start with small portions and gradually increase as your body adjusts.

**Important:** If you have any underlying health conditions, always consult your doctor before starting a prolonged fast.
