# Is it advisable to follow a ketogenic diet with hypoglycemia?

Low blood sugar comes from high blood sugar and the spike of insulin pushing it down – hypoglycemia is high insulin.

**Don’t we need sugar to balance it?**

• The actual cause of hypoglycemia is high insulin so adding more sugar to balance, it raises more insulin. Insulin resistance is also caused by too much insulin. When you have insulin resistance, the body is making 7x the amount of insulin that you need compared to a normal person.

**How to keep insulin normal?**

• Keep sugars low.

• Don’t do frequent meals.

• Consume Magnesium + Potassium + Vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast)
