# How can I do keto on a budget?

Is it expensive, doc? Not if you add intermittent fasting and you can keep the same quality of you can increase the quality because you're not eating as frequent. You're going to save money.

An average person who does one meal a day or two meals a day would save between, you know, two or three to $400 a month. So I think you can reinvest that in increasing more quality, but, um, you know, people think that junk foods or less healthy foods are cheaper. Not necessarily.

You could go, you can get healthier foods. And I just don't, I look at the grocery store and it's, I mean, even going to a fast food restaurant, it'sreally expensive. But being a college student at one time, I would live on like two burgers for a buck. And yes, there are different ways you can cheap out, but you know, you're going to have to maybe do dirty keto if you do that. But I think I would just do intermittent fasting and then keep the quality higher as you find a better job so you can afford more food.
