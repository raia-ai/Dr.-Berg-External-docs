### US shipping methods

1. **Flat Rate Shipping** – for just $4 on all orders under $160. Enjoy a low and consistent fee, no matter the size of your order.

2. **Free Shipping** – on all orders over $160

For both Flat Rate and Free Shipping orders, the shipping method we use is based on your destination and the most efficient carrier available.

Our warehouses use the following shipping methods:

1. **DHL eCommerce (Domestic)** - used for shipments under 1lb, offering affordable shipping with reliable tracking. Orders are transported through DHL’s network and handed off to USPS for final delivery. Typical delivery times range from 3 to 8 business days depending on your location.

2. **UPS SurePost** – This combines the reliability of UPS Ground with the efficiency of USPS for final delivery. Delivery time is typically 2–5 business days. This shipping option handles medium size orders (3–9 lbs).

3. **USPS Priority Delivery** – This option provides reliable and affordable service with tracking and delivery within 3–4 business days. This option is mainly used for orders going to a military address or a US territory.

4. **USPS Ground Advantage** – This option is relatively new and designed to simplify options for packages up to 70 lbs. Packages deliver within 2–5 business days to all 50 states, U.S. military bases, and territories.

5. **Free Shipping** – The shipping method used on these orders is typically UPS SurePost or USPS Ground Advantage.

6. **Buy with Prime** – Amazon Prime members can now enjoy fast, free shipping and a trusted checkout experience directly on our website. Orders placed using Buy with Prime are processed and shipped by Amazon. Most orders are delivered within 1-2 business days, depending on your location.

## International shipments

We’ve partnered with Global-E to offer a seamless shopping experience for our international customers. Global-E helps make your shopping easy by allowing you to:

1. **Shop in your local currency** – No need for conversion calculations. Prices are displayed in your preferred currency. Please note that the shipping address determines which currency you will be charged.

2. **Pay taxes and duties at checkout** – Say goodbye to surprise fees upon delivery. All taxes and import duties are calculated and paid during checkout, so no extra charges show up later.

3. **Multiple payment options** – You can use your preferred payment methods, from credit cards to local options, for a smoother transaction.

Duties and taxes are calculated based on the items ordered, shipment destination, and the value of the purchase. If duties and taxes are charged at checkout, they will appear as a separate line item. If they are already included in the product price, there will be a note at checkout clarifying. Some countries require duties and taxes to be paid upon delivery, and they will be the customer's responsibility. It will be noted at checkout for full transparency before you order.

**FAQ's**

**Warm Weather response:**

*As warmer weather and heat waves impact the country, we want to assure you that your product is well-prepared for these conditions. Our sealed products are specifically formulated to be shelf-stable, and brief exposure to heat during transit will not compromise their quality. To ensure the best results, please collect your package promptly upon delivery to avoid prolonged exposure to high temperatures. You can sign up for shipping alerts with the carrier using the information provided in our shipping notification email.*

 **Recycled tracking numbers**

I’m so sorry for the confusion regarding your tracking information. Recently, we’ve noticed that USPS has been reusing tracking numbers, which can sometimes display the tracking details of a previous package. We’ve escalated this issue to USPS and are hoping for a resolution soon.

In the meantime, your order should still arrive within 3–8 business days. If you haven’t received it after that timeframe, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

### Processing time

We have two warehouse locations, one in Tennessee and another in Utah. These locations were selected to give our customers the quickest transit time within the United States.

We take pride in our efficient processing system. Orders that are received are swiftly prepared for shipment, as we are committed to dispatching them within 24 hours or less.

Our warehouses do not ship out on weekends. Orders received on Friday after 1 pm EST will be shipped out Monday morning.

Our warehouses are closed on federal holidays, which may cause delays in processing time.
