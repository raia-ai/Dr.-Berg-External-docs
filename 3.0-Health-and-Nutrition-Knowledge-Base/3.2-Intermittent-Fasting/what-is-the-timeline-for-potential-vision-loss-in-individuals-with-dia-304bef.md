# What is the timeline for potential vision loss in individuals with diabetes, and what factors can influence the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy?

Normally, it takes 10 years of exposure to high blood sugar before you notice very serious complications to your nervous system, eyes, kidney, and even the brain.

**Some Complications of High Sugar:**

• Numbness in Fingertips and Toes

• Infections

• Kidney Leaks Protein

• Nerves of the Eyes get destroyed

High levels of glucose combined with proteins in the tissue create this situation called Glycated Proteins. The nerves of the eye are fed to the vascular system, if the blood vessels to the nerve can’t flow blood anymore, the nerves die – which causes blindness in a diabetic person. It is a condition called diabetic retinopathy.

• Normal Fasting Blood Glucose: Between 70 – 90

• Prediabetic: 100 – 125

• Diabetic: Over a 125
