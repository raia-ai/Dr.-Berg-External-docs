# What is the main cause of high blood glucose levels when I am in ketosis?

When you do a healthy ketogenic plan and intermittent fasting, you are lowering insulin levels. Insulin suppresses blood sugars but insulin resistance ma still be an issue your body is dealing with. Lower amounts of insulin and insulin resistance cause the blood sugar to spike a little bit higher while you are still in ketosis. In addition, high blood sugar on keto can be caused by excessive protein, too many carbs, frequent meals, or high stress levels.
