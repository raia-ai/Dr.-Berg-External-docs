# How to end dry cough fast?

Most dry cough remedies involve medication that suppresses the cough. However, suppressing the cough is not always best because coughing is one of the body’s vital defense mechanisms. A cough can result from a post-nasal drip caused by an allergy, cold, virus, or fungal infection. It can also be a side effect of certain medications or be related to GERD or asthma.

Many children have asthma because their mothers did not get enough vitamin D during pregnancy. Vitamin D is essential for lung formation. If a cough is caused by croup, vitamin D is also an excellent home remedy. Some coughs are caused by low humidity. In this case, try a humidifier.

Laryngospasms can also cause a dry cough. These spasms are often caused by low calcium in the blood. A deficiency in vitamin D3 can cause low blood calcium. Take 20,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily if you’re dealing with a cough related to laryngospasms. Always take magnesium and vitamin K2 with vitamin D3. Chronic dry cough can also be caused by perfumes, smoke, new furniture, or tic disorders.

NAC (n-acetyl-cysteine) is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory that breaks up mucus in the lungs. To use NAC for a cough, dissolve ¼ teaspoon of NAC powder into 4 ounces of water. Once dissolved, add ⅛ teaspoon of magnesium in the form of Epsom salt. Add this liquid to a nebulizer and breathe in for 5 minutes, 1 to 2 times daily.

• Be sure to use food-grade Epsom salt.

• Make sure the NAC and Epsom salt are fully dissolved before nebulizing.

• Use sterile or distilled water to prevent contamination.

• Consult a healthcare professional before nebulizing any homemade solution.

Black seed oil and white horehound are also good home remedies for a cough if taken with vitamin D3, K2, magnesium, and zinc.
