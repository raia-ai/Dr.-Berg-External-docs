# Am I still getting the benefits of intermittent fasting if I drink coffee with some milk in the morning?

The impact of adding some milk to your morning coffee while intermittent fasting depends largely on the calorie content. A small amount is unlikely to significantly disrupt your fasting benefits. The key is to avoid excessive calories that could affect insulin levels. To maximize the benefits of intermittent fasting, it's also important to avoid snacking during your eating window. This helps maintain a lower insulin response and enhances the overall effectiveness of your fasting regimen.
