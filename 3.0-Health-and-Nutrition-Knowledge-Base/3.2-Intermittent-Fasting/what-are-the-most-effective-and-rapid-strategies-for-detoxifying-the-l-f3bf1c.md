# What are the most effective and rapid strategies for detoxifying the liver, and how do various dietary, lifestyle, and supplementation approaches contribute to this process?

**Here are some tips for supporting your liver health:**

To support and speed up liver detoxification, we need to trigger autophagy.

The best ways to trigger autophagy:

1\. Dry fasting (Recommend doing it under medical supervision)

2\. Water fasting

3\. Calorie restriction

4\. Sleep

5\. Exercise

6\. Keto diet

7\. Phytonutrients

Dry fasting (recommended under medical supervision) is one of the most powerful ways to trigger autophagy and truly cleanse the liver cells.

With dry fasting, you don’t consume any food or water. To cleanse the liver, you may want to consider dry fasting for a full day—starting at sunrise and ending at sunset.

The effects of just one day of dry fasting are equivalent to three days of water fasting.

Additional benefits of dry fasting:

• Enhanced immunity

• Liver and kidney support

• Mental clarity

• Decreased inflammation

When the sun sets, you’ll eat your one meal for the day, which should consist of meat and cruciferous vegetables. These foods are also great for cleaning the liver.

Try dry fasting for three days of the month (they don't need to be consecutive) and see how you feel. (recommended that it is done under medical supervision)

Before you start dry fasting, take bile salts or TUDCA, consume beets, or drink apple cider vinegar with water to help thin your bile.

This can help prevent any negative liver detox side effects.
