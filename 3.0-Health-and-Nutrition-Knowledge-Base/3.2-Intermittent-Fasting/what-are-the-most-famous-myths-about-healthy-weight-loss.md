# What are the most famous myths about "healthy" weight loss?

Here are 7 lessons I learned from weight loss failures from my practice of 25 years and working with 40,000 people.

1\. Fruit – Don’t use fruit if you are trying to lose weight and someone who has a slow metabolism. Even small amounts of fruit can block a lot of fat burning.

2\. Snacks – Snacking increases insulin because every time you eat, you trigger insulin. Cutting out snacks creates huge benefits.

3\. 2 weeks – low protein (Liver enhancement) or no protein – would cause a lot of blood sugar issues because our bodies need amino acids to rebuild and repair. Cutting it too low or not enough will cause problems like hair loss, loss of muscle, etc.

4\. “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day” – It screws up and breaks the all-night fasting. Push yourself to eat closer to lunch and not eat until you’re hungry and eventually skip breakfast.

5\. Low Fat (Lean Protein) – Fat is very important to satisfy the appetite to go from one meal to another. It is the only macronutrient that doesn’t trigger insulin – the more pure the fat is, the lower the influence it has on insulin.

6\. History – Clue (Ignoring – Focusing more on diving into the process directly and not ignoring the clues.

7\. Omitting Getting Healthy First – It is not losing weight to get healthy, it is getting healthy first and then losing the weight. Focus on the health indicators: energy level, cravings are gone, stress level better.
