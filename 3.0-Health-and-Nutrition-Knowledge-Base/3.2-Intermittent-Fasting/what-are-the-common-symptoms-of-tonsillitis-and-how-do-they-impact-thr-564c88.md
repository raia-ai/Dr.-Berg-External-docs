# What are the common symptoms of tonsillitis, and how do they impact throat health and overall comfort?

Tonsillitis means inflamed tonsils. Tonsils are little glands on both sides of your inner throat. Tonsils are primarily involved in protecting your respiratory (breathing-related) organs from harmful microbes and viruses. In fact tonsils are the first line of your respiratory immune defense.

Symptoms:

- Infection in your throat

- Sore throat

- Inflamed tonsils

- Swollen throat

**Cause #1: High-carb diet**

Over years of practice I noticed a common characteristic of patients who had tonsil problems. Most of them were on a high-carb diet. Eating sugar and refined carbs will spike your insulin (fat- storing hormone), which in turn acts as an inflammatory hormone. This in itself can deplete your body of nutrients important for a healthy immune system.

**Cause 2: Weak immune system**

If you have a weak immune system, this can cause inflammation of your tonsils because they are part of it. Usually, tonsillitis is caused by viral or bacterial infection. Therefore, improving your ability to fight infections and bacteria will reduce the inflammation and improve the health of the body in general, including giving additional strength to your tonsils.
