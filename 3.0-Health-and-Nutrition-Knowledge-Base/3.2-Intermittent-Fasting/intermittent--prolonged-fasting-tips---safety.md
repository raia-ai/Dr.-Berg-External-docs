# Intermittent & Prolonged Fasting Tips - Safety

1. Work with a nutritionist or healthcare provider to monitor your nutrient levels and overall health while fasting. 

2. Never push through hunger on a fast.  Feelings of hunger and urges are normal and should pass quickly if your body has adequate nutrients to support a fast.  However, if feelings of hunger become bothersome to the point your energy and mood decrease or you become anxious, gradually reintroduce food based on the steps outlined in the Breaking Your Prolonged Fast section below.

 Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do *not* encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provide this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

 **Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast.  If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**
