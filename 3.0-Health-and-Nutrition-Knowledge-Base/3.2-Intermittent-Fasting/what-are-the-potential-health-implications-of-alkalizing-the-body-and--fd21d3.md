# What are the potential health implications of alkalizing the body, and how does this approach influence systemic pH balance and overall physiological function?

The alkaline-cancer myth is that if you alkalize your body, you will be better protected against cancer. This is not true.

The first question you have to ask is, what part of the body are they even talking about? The stomach, intestines, saliva, urine, and blood all have different pH levels. Are they saying that you need to alkalize the entire body? This would cause devastating effects.

Itâ€™s true that tumors grow faster in an acidic environment; however, tumors and cancers make an acidic environment.

No studies show that alkalizing the body will reduce the risk of cancer.

Cruciferous vegetables are incredible for lowering the risk of cancer. The nutrients in cruciferous vegetables help cut off the blood supply to cancerous cells, making it far more difficult for them to live and replicate.
