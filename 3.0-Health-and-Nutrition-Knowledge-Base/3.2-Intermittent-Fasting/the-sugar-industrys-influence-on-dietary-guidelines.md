# The Sugar Industry's Influence on Dietary Guidelines

## **The Sugar Industry's Influence on Dietary Guidelines**

Did you know the sugar industry holds significant sway over our dietary guidelines? They make up only 2% of farms but account for a third of all donations from US agriculture.

It's like David throwing stones at Goliath, except this time, David has a serious sweet tooth.

### **Unveiling the Power of Lobbyists**

Sugar lobbyists have mastered the art of influence to shape dietary recommendations. Just imagine them as puppeteers controlling how we perceive and consume sugar in our diets.

Their tactics are subtle yet effective, like adding just enough sugar to your coffee without making it overly sweet.

Their power extends far beyond merely advocating for their interests. They're also skilled in altering perceptions about food pyramid recommendations—twisting scientific facts into knots that even Houdini would struggle with.

### **Discrediting Anti-Sugar Research**

Besides shaping guidelines, these clever folks are adept at undermining research suggesting harm from high-sugar consumption—it’s as if they've turned deflecting criticism into an Olympic sport.

In their world, science isn't always black or white; it's often coated with a layer of sugary deception.

As cunning as foxes sneaking through henhouses under the moonlight, they work tirelessly to discredit any evidence that paints sugar in less than glowing terms.

## **The Surprising Truth About Obesity and Metabolism**

Contrary to commonly assumed, not all obese people have a [slow metabolism](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-fix-a-slow-metabolism); research has revealed that approximately 20% maintain regular metabolic rates. Studies show that around 20% of obese individuals carry standard metabolic rates.

### **Obesity Doesn't Always Mean Poor Metabolism**

You may be astounded to find out that some people classified as overweight have normal metabolisms.

They defy the stereotype of [obesity](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-answer-to-obesity-is-obvious-if-you-look-at-the-statistics), leading inevitably to diabetes or heart disease. Just like you can't judge a book by its cover, you can't predict an individual's health based on weight alone.

Despite carrying extra pounds, they avoid the common trap of developing insulin resistance - a critical factor in metabolic syndrome and related conditions such as [type 2 diabetes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-to-eat-to-correct-diabetes) and cardiovascular diseases.

This group is often called "metabolically healthy obese" (MHO), but don't be misled – it doesn't imply obesity is good for health.

However, don't let this term fool you – it does not mean obesity is healthy. It merely means these individuals appear resilient against the usual detrimental effects of excess body fat.

[Research suggests](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22804876), though somewhat controversially due to conflicting findings from various studies, about one-fifth of those who are clinically defined as 'obese' actually fall into this MHO category.

This throws up fascinating questions for scientists looking at how we approach dieting strategies and overall health promotion.

## **The World Health Organization's Stance on Sugar Consumption**

The World Health Organization (WHO) has a clear-cut guideline regarding the daily sugar intake. According to them, your sweet tooth should be limited to 12 teaspoons of added sugar daily.

It's easy to see how quickly we can surpass the WHO recommendation of no more than 12 teaspoons of added sugar per day when one soda contains nearly that amount. And what happens if we do?

Things start getting sticky – not in the fun caramel way.

### **The Not-So-Sweet Consequences**

High consumption may lead to numerous health issues, including diabetes and heart disease. It's almost as if consuming too much sugar is akin to inviting unwanted guests into our bodies - they're hard to get rid of once they've made themselves comfortable.

In other words, while enjoying sweets now and then won't cause any harm, consistent overconsumption could turn life sour fast.
