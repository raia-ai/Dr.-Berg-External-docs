# What is the typical timeframe required to effectively reverse diabetes, and what factors influence the speed and success of achieving healthy blood sugar levels?

How long it takes to reverse diabetes depends on your overall health status, severity of diabetes, and your commitment to dietary and lifestyle changes. While some individuals can reverse diabetes within three months of starting intermittent fasting and Healthy Keto, others may require up to six months to restore blood sugar control.
