# What strategies can I employ to enhance the diversity of my gut microbiome, including dietary adjustments, lifestyle changes, and probiotic or prebiotic supplementation?

Ideally, you want a rich microbiome with a lot of different species. Without this diversity, you’ll provide the perfect space for harmful bacteria to thrive.

This lack of diversity is called dysbiosis, and it’s associated with many different serious health conditions.

**How to increase the diversity of microbes in your gut and boost your health:**

1\. Consume food that has been grown on soil that has a diverse microbiome

2\. Increase the diversity of plant foods in your diet

3\. Exercise

4\. Get plenty of quality sleep

5\. Do intermittent fasting

6\. Consume phenols

7\. Consume sprouts or microgreens grown on soil

8\. Consume probiotic foods

9\. Consume raw foods
