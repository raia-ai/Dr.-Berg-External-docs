# Which vitamin is most effective for promoting healthy skin, and how does it contribute to skin health and appearance?

**If you are deficient in vitamin B3, you can end up with pellagra. However, there’s also a subclinical version of this B3 deficiency. This is a situation where you have dermatitis—dry, brittle, scaly, and red skin.**

**Vitamin B3 helps protect and restore your DNA, which results in your skin feeling and looking vibrant and healthy.**

Studies show that those with pellagra see amazing results when taking vitamin B3. Those with pellagra often consume too much corn, flour, rice, and alcohol. To fix this problem, people started adding synthetic vitamin B3 to enhance these foods. The problem is, synthetic vitamins don’t have the same effects as natural ones.

**A healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting eliminate this problem. You should know that the best form of vitamin B3 is niacinamide.**

**Vitamin B3 can also help with:**

• Brown spots

• Skin cancer

• Anti-aging

• Decreased acne
