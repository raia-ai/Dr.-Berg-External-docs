# Who shouldn’t do OMAD?

Those who exercise heavily or have a history of eating disorders shouldn’t practice OMAD. In addition, pregnancy and breastfeeding are periods of increased caloric need, and it’s not recommended that pregnant or breastfeeding mothers follow OMAD or any other intermittent fasting schedule.
