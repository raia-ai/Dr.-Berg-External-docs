# Is a higher glucose level normal when testing outside of the fasting window?

A higher glucose level outside of the fasting window is generally expected, especially after consuming carbohydrates. However, if blood sugar remains elevated when not eating, it could indicate underlying insulin resistance or other factors. For example, morning glucose spikes can result from cortisol release, which mobilizes stored sugar. Additionally, exercise can temporarily raise blood sugar levels.

To assess long-term glucose control, A1C testing is more informative, as it reflects average blood glucose over three months. To manage higher blood sugar, consider regular exercise, using diluted apple cider vinegar, and incorporating supplements like berberine to support insulin sensitivity.
