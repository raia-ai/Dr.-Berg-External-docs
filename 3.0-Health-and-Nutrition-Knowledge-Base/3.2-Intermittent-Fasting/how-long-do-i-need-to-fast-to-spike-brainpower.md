# How long do I need to fast to spike brainpower?

**To start seeing these incredible cognitive benefits, you have to fast for at least 18 hours a day.**

With an 18:6 intermittent fasting pattern, you would fast for 18 hours and have a 6-hour eating window. This means no snacking while fasting. You can eat during your 6-hour window, but I recommend only two meals. If you are still hungry, add more fat at the end of your meals.

Ketones are very therapeutic for your brain.

**There are three ways to get your body to produce ketones:**

1\. Go on the keto diet

2\. Fasting

3\. Exercise
