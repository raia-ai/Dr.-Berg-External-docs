# Can I be thin and have insulin resistance?

Insulin resistance can affect individuals of all body types, including those who are thin and struggle to gain weight. It can impact blood sugar levels, mood, cognitive function, and may lead to fatty liver, which isn't always apparent physically.

When following a ketogenic diet, especially when combined with fasting, maintaining weight can be challenging.
