# How to get rid of mucus fast?

NAC works similarly to salt by thinning mucus, but it also stops its production. It’s a potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral agent that can even break up biofilms. NAC also strengthens the cilia in the respiratory system, which helps to move mucus.

NAC can be taken orally, injected, or inhaled through a nebulizer. It can be beneficial for respiratory congestion related to an infection or for diseases like COPD or cystic fibrosis. NAC is also used in hospitals as an antidote for Tylenol poisoning. NAC helps enhance brain function and may be beneficial for people with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson's, OCD, addictions, depression, and schizophrenia. NAC can improve insulin sensitivity, which helps regulate blood sugar and prevent a fatty liver. It promotes healthy blood pressure and cholesterol, and can even help with asthma.

You can reduce respiratory mucus with salt if you’re dealing with an acute infection, but NAC can eliminate mucus and the inflammation behind it. Vitamin C, curcumin, probiotics, magnesium, quercetin, and vitamin D can all improve the effectiveness of NAC.
