# What is the biggest danger of prolonged fasting?

Prolonged fasting is very beneficial to support a healthy body. However, there is one aspect of prolonged fasting that can be dangerous, and that’s what we’re going to cover today. Prolonged fasting is when you fast for three or more days. The biggest danger of prolonged fasting is called refeeding syndrome. This can happen if a person consumes too much of the wrong foods too fast after coming off of a prolonged fast.

However, the risk of refeeding syndrome is low if you aren’t malnourished going into a prolonged fast. As a bare minimum, when you start any type of fasting, you need to take electrolytes and B vitamins.
