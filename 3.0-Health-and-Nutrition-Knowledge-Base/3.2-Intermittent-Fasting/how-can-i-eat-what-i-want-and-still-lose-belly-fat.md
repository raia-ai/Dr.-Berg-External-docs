# How can I eat what I want and still lose belly fat?

It's more effective to change when you eat than what you eat to lose weight. Follow this guideline: have your first meal at 1:00 PM and your last meal at 5:00 PM, creating a 4-hour eating window. If this is too challenging, you can start with a 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM window instead. If needed, you can also include bulletproof coffee in the morning to help manage your eating window.

Benefits of This Eating Pattern:

• Significantly reduces insulin levels

• Promotes fat release through decreased insulin

• Reduces hunger and cravings
