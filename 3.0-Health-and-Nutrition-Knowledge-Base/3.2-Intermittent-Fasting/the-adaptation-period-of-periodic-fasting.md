# The Adaptation Period of Periodic Fasting

Starting a periodic fasting regimen involves a significant metabolic shift as the body transitions from using glucose to burning fat for fuel. This adaptation process, known as ketosis, typically takes between three to seven days.

**Understanding the Shift to Fat Burning**

Initially, fasting depletes glycogen stores in the liver and muscles. Once these reserves are low, usually within 24-48 hours, the body begins lipolysis, breaking down fat into fatty acids. The liver then converts these fatty acids into ketones, providing an alternative energy source for the brain and organs.

**Navigating Early Side Effects**

During this transition, you may experience temporary side effects, including fatigue, irritability, brain fog, and symptoms akin to the "keto flu." Hypoglycemia, characterized by shakiness, dizziness, and lightheadedness, is also common as insulin levels drop and glucose intake ceases.

These symptoms generally subside within the first week as the body adapts to fat metabolism. Staying hydrated, getting adequate rest, and monitoring your body's responses can help alleviate discomfort during this adaptation phase.
