# I'm scared to do intermittent fasting, is there anything to worry about?

Intermittent fasting offers numerous benefits, including improved cognitive function such as enhanced focus and memory, mood elevation, reduced inflammation, and the promotion of new cell growth in the brain. To begin fasting, start by consuming three meals a day without snacking. Incorporate more fat into your meals to help extend the time between eating. Initially, the primary goal should not be weight loss but rather reducing hunger and promoting your overall health.
