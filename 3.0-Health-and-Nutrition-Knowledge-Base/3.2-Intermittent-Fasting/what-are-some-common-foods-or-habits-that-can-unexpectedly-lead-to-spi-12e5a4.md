# What are some common foods or habits that can unexpectedly lead to spikes in blood sugar levels, and how can individuals better manage their glucose response through dietary choices?

Justin Richard, motivated by a family history of type 2 diabetes, decided to take control of his health by exploring the impact of food on his blood sugar levels. Using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), he discovered how different foods affected him, particularly noticing the energy dips he experienced in his late 40s after consuming certain meals.

Initially, Justin followed his regular diet, which included a lot of processed foods. To his surprise, the CGM revealed how these foods caused significant and prolonged spikes in his blood sugar levels.

Through his experiments, Justin discovered some unexpected truths. He learned that white flour, bread, and even whole wheat bread had similar effects on his blood sugar, with Ezekiel bread being the least impactful. Additionally, he noticed that stress and lack of sleep caused his fasting blood glucose to rise significantly.

To manage his blood sugar levels, Justin adopted several strategies. He began combining carbs with protein, fat, and fiber to slow down digestion and reduce blood sugar spikes. He also found that drinking apple cider vinegar mixed with water before meals had a similar effect.

Justin shares his top tips for making healthier food choices and breaking bad eating habits:

1. Avoid grocery shopping on an empty stomach.

2. Resist the temptation to buy junk food at the store.

3. Take a walk after a large meal.

4. Don't consume sweets after meals or upon waking.

Based on his positive experience, Justin highly recommends the Signos CGM device as a tool for anyone interested in understanding and managing their blood sugar levels.
