# What are the most common Keto mistakes that slow your progress down?

Common mistakes on keto and how to address them:

1\. **Excessive Fat Consumption:** Focus on reducing carbs rather than adding more fat. Only increase fat intake if you're new to keto and need support during fasting.

2\. **Snacking:** Avoid keto snacks and stick to regular meals to minimize insulin spikes.

3\. **Hidden Carbs:** Check food labels for hidden carbs like maltodextrin. Avoid fruits, berries, and agave nectar.

4\. **Inadequate Protein Intake:** Ensure you're consuming enough quality protein to signal satiety to the brain and prevent deficiencies. Consider amino acid supplements if needed during fasting.
