# What effective strategies can I implement to alleviate restless leg syndrome and address the burning sensation in my feet?

That condition sounds to me like something like peripheral neuropathy. So hopefully you're taking Benfotiamine. That's for peripheral neuropathy.And it usually comes with alpha-lipoic acid together. Those are two wonderful things for the nerves. I don't know what your diet looks like, but I hope you get on keto and intermittent fasting because that would ultimately correct it.

This is really a problem with this issue with the depletion of vitamin B1 when you're taking so many carbs. On a rare occasion, it could be coming from an imbalance with magnesium and calcium.
