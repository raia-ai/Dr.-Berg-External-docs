# Is fasting good or bad for the liver?

The liver is one of the only organs that can completely regenerate if you have at least 25% of your liver left. If you look down and you have a gut, chances are you have a fatty liver. Fasting however, can help boost the liver's regenerative potential and reduce your weight, which also alleviates pressure on this organ.

Fasting for over 18 hours (after receiving professional medical advice) can help reverse fatty liver disease, reduce an enlarged liver, lower liver enzymes, improve fibrosis, and even stimulate autophagy (the body's repair process). Taking choline and applied cider vinegar in conjunction with fasting.
