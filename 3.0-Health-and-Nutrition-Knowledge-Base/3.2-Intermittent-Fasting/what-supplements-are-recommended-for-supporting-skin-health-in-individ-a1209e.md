# What supplements are recommended for supporting skin health in individuals with vitiligo, and how do they contribute to the management of this condition?

Vitiligo is a depigmentation problem. You lose your skin pigment in certain areas of your body. The cells in control of the skin pigment—known as melanocytes—have stopped functioning properly.

This condition is often associated with autoimmunity. Those with vitiligo may have other autoimmune conditions. Vitiligo is associated with a large amount of free radical damage. ROS and hydrogen peroxide cause a lot of oxidation.

Zinc and copper are involved in a very powerful antioxidant called SOD (superoxide dismutase).

Light therapy may be used to combat vitiligo. A pilot study showed that when vitiligo patients take 35,000 IUs of vitamin D, 14 out of 16 see significant repigmentation.

**There are three supplements you can take for vitiligo:**

1\. Zinc - 100 mg

2\. Vitamin D - 35,000 IUs

3\. Copper - 1500 mcg

**Fasting may also benefit those with vitiligo since it’s related to autoimmunity.**
