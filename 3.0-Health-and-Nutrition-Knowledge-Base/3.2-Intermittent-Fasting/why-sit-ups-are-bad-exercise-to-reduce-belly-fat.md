# Why sit ups are bad exercise to reduce belly fat?

Sit ups are actually the worst exercise to help reduce belly fat. This goes against so many philosophies. But, when you think about it, you’re getting the abdominal muscles contracted, but that skin is actually getting looser. I’m going to show you a much better way to lose belly fat fast, and it’s called reversed sit ups. 

While standing, you want to tighten your abdominal muscles and stretch backward and then forward. You’ll want to do this about 25 times, rest for about 3-4 minutes, and then do another set of 25. Try doing 3 sets every day. If you have lower back pain, you want to go really light, like maybe just 3 sets of 5-10. You can also lay on your stomach and arch up. 

Doing regular sit ups can give you an imbalance and lead to back pain. This is a fantastic exercise for loose skin in the lower part of your stomach that’s really difficult to tighten.
