# How do I incorporate nightshades into my diet?

**Incorporating Nightshades into Your Diet**

**Balance Your Nutrient Intake:** Nightshade vegetables can be a valuable addition to your diet when consumed in moderation. To maximize their benefits, pair them with other nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens and fatty fish.

**Dietary Considerations:** For those on specialized diets, such as ketogenic or intermittent fasting, nightshades can be included in moderation. Ensure they align with your dietary goals and monitor for any sensitivities or adverse effects.
