# Prolonged Fasting - Build Up Nutrients with Healthy Keto®

An adequate nutrient reserve is essential to a safe prolonged fast.  Healthy Keto® is a low-carb, high-fat, moderate-protein diet focusing on high-quality, nutrient-dense foods.   

Healthy Keto® emphasizes organic vegetables, full-fat organic dairy, and wild-caught, grass-fed, pasture-raised meat, fish, fowl, and eggs to maximize vitamin and mineral nutrients.  Healthy Keto® replaces unhealthy oils like soy, corn, and canola oil with healthier butter, coconut, avocado, olive, and animal fats to help reduce inflammation and support improved nutrient absorption.  Dr. Berg’s Healthy Keto® also encourages the consumption of 7 to 10 cups of vegetables daily for adequate vitamins and mineral nutrients. 

**Always Start with Intermittent Fasting** 

Intermittent fasting serves as a foundational step before transitioning to prolonged fasting for several reasons: 

1. **Adaptation to Fasting State:** Intermittent fasting helps your body gradually adapt to periods without food. This adaptation can make the transition to prolonged fasting smoother and more manageable. 

2. **Metabolic Flexibility:** Intermittent fasting enhances your body's ability to switch between using glucose and fat as energy sources. This metabolic flexibility is crucial for prolonged fasting, where your body needs to utilize fat stores for energy over extended periods efficiently. 

3. **Building Fasting Tolerance:** Starting with intermittent fasting allows you to build knowledge of your hunger signs and learn how your body responds to fasting. This experience is valuable when you extend the fasting duration in prolonged fasting. 

4. **Safety and Efficacy:** Gradually increasing fasting duration through intermittent fasting is essential to a safer and more efficient fast than jumping directly into prolonged fasting, which can be more challenging and has a higher risk of adverse effects if not done correctly. 

Starting with intermittent fasting prepares your body and mind for the more intensive experience of prolonged fasting, potentially enhancing both the experience and the benefits. 

To start intermittent fasting, you can follow these steps: 

1. **Choose Your Fasting Plan**: Decide a fasting schedule that suits your lifestyle. Standard plans include the 16:8 method, where you fast for 16 hours and eat during an 8-hour window. 

2. **Gradually Increase Fasting Time**: Begin by slowly extending your overnight fast. For example, delay breakfast by an hour and gradually increase until you can comfortably skip it. 

3. **Stay Hydrated**: During fasting periods, drink plenty of water and electrolyte water. Black coffee or herbal teas should be consumed in limited amounts, as they can dehydrate you. 

4. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to how your body responds. If you experience fatigue or feel unusually cold, these could be signs that you’re advancing too quickly. 

5. **Nutrient-Dense Foods**: During your feeding window, choose nutrient-dense foods, such as those on the [Healthy Keto® Approved Foods](https://www.drberg.com/ketosis-approved-foods) list. 

6. **Consult Healthcare Providers**: If you have any health conditions or concerns, consult a healthcare provider before starting an intermittent fasting regimen.

We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provides this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast.  If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**
