# What foods can help to reverse kidney damage?

Potassium protects kidney health in several ways. It helps lower high blood pressure, which damages the kidneys and protects against kidney stones. Too much sodium can be hard on the kidneys, but the remedy is more potassium.

A proper diet with adequate vitamin D, potassium, and magnesium can significantly improve kidney health.

The following foods protect the kidneys from damage and support kidney health:

1\. Vegetables: asparagus, celery, bell peppers, cabbage, cauliflower, garlic

2\. Magnesium-rich foods: pumpkin seeds, leafy greens, avocadoes, magnesium glycinate

3\. Probiotic-foods: kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi

4\. Moderate amounts of high-quality protein

5\. High-antioxidant foods: strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, beets

6\. Quercetin: onions

7\. Extra virgin olive oil

Consuming tea is a great way to stay hydrated and support kidney health. Polyphenols found in tea are very beneficial for the kidney. Green, nettle, dandelion, turmeric, and decaffeinated black tea are all great options. Frequent eating can overtax the kidneys' filtration system. A low-carb diet and intermittent fasting are very beneficial for kidney health. Intermittent fasting can decrease the stress on the kidneys and significantly reduce insulin. Too much insulin can be damaging to the kidneys.
