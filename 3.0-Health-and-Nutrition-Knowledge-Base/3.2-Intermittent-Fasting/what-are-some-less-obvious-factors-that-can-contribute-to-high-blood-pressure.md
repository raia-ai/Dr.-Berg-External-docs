# What are some less obvious factors that can contribute to high blood pressure?

9 reasons your blood sugar may be high:

1\. Cortisol: A morning cortisol spike can raise blood sugar.

2\. Low Blood Sugar: Hormonal overcompensation for low blood sugar can lead to high blood sugar.

3\. Late-Night Snacks: Carb-rich snacks can increase blood sugar.

4\. Previous Day's Sugar: Sugar consumed the day before can affect blood sugar the next day.

5\. Low Blood Pressure: Medications for low blood pressure can raise blood glucose.

6\. Stress: Stress and anxiety can elevate cortisol and blood sugar.

7\. Missed Meds: Forgetting medications can disrupt blood sugar levels.

8\. Nighttime Exercise: Exercising late may cause your body to overcompensate.

9\. Additives: MSG and artificial sweeteners can spike blood sugar. Addressing insulin resistance with healthy keto and intermittent fasting may help.
