# What exercise burns the most calories?

We're diving into the truth about calorie burning and the best exercises to maximize it.

It's crucial to understand that the type of calories you burn is directly linked to your diet. A sugary diet leads to burning sugar calories, while a sugar-free, higher-fat diet promotes fat burning.

Overtraining is a common pitfall, as it elevates cortisol levels, which can break down muscle protein. Instead, prioritize the health of your mitochondria â€“ the powerhouses of your cells.

Healthy mitochondria are key to energy levels, recovery, and endurance. Factors like certain medications (e.g., statins) can weaken them, so it's important to support them through:

- Exercise with ample rest

- Maintaining thyroid health

- Building muscle mass

- Intermittent fasting

- Cold therapy

- Including meat in your diet

Mitochondrial health can be assessed through metabolomics testing. Additionally, addressing insulin resistance, which can harm mitochondria, is vital. Growth hormone can be beneficial in reducing insulin resistance, building muscle, and promoting fat burning.

Remember, a high-carb diet can hinder fat burning. It's essential to look beyond just calories and focus on overall fat loss, which is 85% diet and only 15% exercise.

For maximum calorie burning, opt for high-intensity exercises that engage multiple muscle groups.
