# What factors could explain why you feel tired during the day but struggle to fall asleep at night?

To optimize sleep quality:

1\. Avoid drinking water after 7 pm to minimize disruptions from restroom visits, especially if you have insulin resistance or pre-diabetes.

2\. Limit caffeine intake to one 8 oz cup of coffee per day, as excess caffeine can interfere with falling asleep.

3\. Control protein consumption to 3 to 8 oz per meal, as too much protein can act as a stimulant.

4\. Expend energy through activities like long walks, exercise, or physical work to help facilitate falling asleep.

5\. Aim to sleep during the first circadian wave around 9:30 pm for easier sleep initiation.

6\. Consider natural sleep aids like calcium lactate to promote faster sleep onset.

7\. Maintain a slightly cool room temperature for optimal sleep, as people generally sleep better in cooler environments.
