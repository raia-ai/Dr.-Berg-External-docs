# What are the fats that can help with fatty liver?

Many people are afraid of fat. They think that if they consume any fat, it will give them a fatty liver. But, I believe that carbohydrates are really the big cause behind a fatty liver.

Here are three fats you could start to consume in larger amounts to potentially help fix a fatty liver:

**1\. Olive oil (organic extra virgin)**

• Anti-inflammatory 

• Omega-9 fatty acid 

• Supports a fatty liver 

**2\. Fish oil or cod liver oil (wild-caught)**

• Rich in omega-3 fatty acid 

• Can help inhibit fat from accumulating on the liver 

• Can help reduce the fat in the liver

• Anti-inflammatory 

• Supports the retinas, heart, and brain 

**3\. Virgin coconut oil** 

• Can help reverse a fatty liver in rat studies 

**Other things you could do to help reduce fat on the liver:**

1\. Purified bile salts 

2\. Choline 

3\. Cutting carbs and sugar (especially fructose) 4. Fasting
