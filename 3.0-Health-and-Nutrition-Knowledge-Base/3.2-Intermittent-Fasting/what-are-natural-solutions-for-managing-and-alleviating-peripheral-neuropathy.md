**Peripheral Neuropathy: Natural Solution and the Root Cause**

Peripheral neuropathy is painful nerve damage often felt as burning, tingling, or hypersensitivity in the feet and hands. This video explains what causes peripheral neuropathy and offers a natural solution.

**What causes peripheral neuropathy?**

- **Diabetes:** The most common cause. High blood sugar damages the protective covering (myelin sheath) of nerves.

- **Other causes:** Chemotherapy, hypothyroidism, autoimmune diseases, medications, viruses, and Lyme disease.

**Natural Alternative for Peripheral Neuropathy**

Instead of just treating symptoms, it's vital to address the root cause. Here's how:

- **Benfotiamine:** A form of vitamin B1 that supports nerve health. Take 300mg, four times per day.

- **Lipoic acid:** Helps your body process excess glucose.

- **Vitamins B5, B2, B3:** Also aid in glucose metabolism.

- **Low-carb diet & intermittent fasting:** Crucial for controlling blood sugar and the true root cause of neuropathy.

**Important:** Prolonged nerve damage from diabetes is serious. This information is not a replacement for your doctor's advice.
