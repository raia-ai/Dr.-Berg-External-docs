# How can a pro athlete transition to keto and fasting safely without having the risk of kidney stones?

There's a couple of factors that make up the stone. One is the consumption of food that has a lot of oxalates in it. You want to avoid those foods. It's very high in almonds and almond flour. A lot of Keto products contain almonds or almond flour. Spinach also has high levels of oxalates. As well as chocolate and even sugar-free chocolate. Kiwis are also on the list. Try avoiding these foods.

But the other thing too, is that it's impossible to get a kidney stone unless there's a super concentrated urine in your bladder or your kidneys. One solution is to make sure you have at least two and a half liters of fluid a day.
