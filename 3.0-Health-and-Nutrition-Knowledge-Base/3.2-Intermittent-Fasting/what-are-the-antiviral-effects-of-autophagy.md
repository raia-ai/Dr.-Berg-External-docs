# What are the antiviral effects of autophagy?

Autophagy, meaning "self-eat," is a bodily mechanism that breaks down and recycles damaged proteins and has unique antiviral effects. It helps eliminate:

\- Viruses

\- Bacteria

\- Fungus

\- Candida

\- Biofilms/nanobacteria

Autophagy works with the immune system to defend against harmful microbes. However, some viruses can resist autophagy depending on immune strength and other factors.

Other effective remedies for viruses include:

\- Colloidal silver

\- Elderberry

\- Garlic

\- Olive leaf

\- Zinc
