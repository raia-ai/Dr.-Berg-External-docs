# Why am I experiencing a cold sensation on Keto, and what should I do?

A cold sensation may occur while following a ketogenic diet, particularly during intermittent fasting. This can result from a reduced frequency of meals, causing your body to adapt by decreasing its metabolic workload. As your thyroid adjusts to these changes, you might feel cooler.

To help mitigate this sensation, consider incorporating iodine into your diet, such as from high-quality sea kelp, particularly during periods of intermittent fasting. This can support thyroid function and overall metabolic balance.
