# What can I do for prostate issues?

For individuals experiencing prostate issues, it is important to consider the potential impact of dairy consumption. Dairy products can elevate hormonal levels, including estrogen, which may contribute to prostate enlargement. Reducing or eliminating dairy, particularly milk and certain cheeses, could alleviate some symptoms.

Additionally, many men report frequent nighttime urination, often attributed to prostate enlargement. However, implementing intermittent fasting and reducing carbohydrate intake—particularly by avoiding late-night snacking—can significantly improve urinary retention. Transitioning to two meals or even one meal per day may enable better bladder control, allowing for uninterrupted sleep. This shift in dietary habits may reveal that the underlying issue is related to insulin resistance rather than solely a prostate condition.
