# What is glucagon and what is its role in the body?

The pancreas has two cells: Beta cells, which make insulin, and Alpha cells, which make another hormone called glucagon.

Glucagon opposes insulin, which means insulin lowers blood sugar, and glucagon raises it by breaking down glycogen, stored sugar in the liver. Glucagon also makes new glucose if needed, and that process is called gluconeogenesis.

Ways Glucagon Raises Blood Sugar:

1\. Breaks down glycogen

2\. Makes new glucose (gluconeogenesis)

3\. Activates fat release

4\. Inhibits fat storage

5\. Increases bile release

What Triggers Glucagon:

1\. Lower blood glucose or lower insulin

2\. Amino Acids (Moderate amount)

3\. Exercise â€“ The more exhaustive it is, the more triggering, up to 4 to 5x.
