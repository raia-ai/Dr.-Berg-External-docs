# What is the 1st sign of fatty liver?

There really is no “first sign” of a fatty liver. When you first start developing a fatty liver, there are no symptoms at all. It’s important to be aware of this because many people have a fatty liver and don’t even know it. People will start to notice signs once the condition has progressed.

Signs of a fatty liver:

• A protruding mid-section

• Insulin resistance

Fifty-nine percent of the fat in your liver originates from outside your liver—it’s fat from other places in your body that end up in the liver. Twenty-six percent of fat in the liver comes from the liver itself. The liver makes fat from glucose, and insulin is supposed to stop this process. But, because of dysfunctional fat and insulin resistance, the liver is making sugar uncontrollably. The third source of fat in the liver is dietary fat from consuming sugar. I believe the top cause of a fatty liver is a high-carb diet. The good news is that the liver is the only organ that can completely regenerate. However, there is a point of no return, so it’s time to act now.

**Natural things to do for a fatty liver:**

1\. Get on the Healthy Keto® diet and do intermittent fasting

2\. Exercise regularly

3\. Consume one to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in your water a few times a day
