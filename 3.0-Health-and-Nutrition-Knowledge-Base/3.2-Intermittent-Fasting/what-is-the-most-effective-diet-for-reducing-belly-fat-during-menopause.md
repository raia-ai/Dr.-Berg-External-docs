# What is the most effective diet for reducing belly fat during menopause?

The keto diet is the best diet for menopausal women.

During menopause, women experience a sudden loss of ovarian function. With that comes a spike in insulin, which causes belly fat.

When you go through menopause, your insulin is going to be higher and you’ll have insulin resistance. Here’s the Healthy Keto® way to handle it:

- Cut carbs down to 20 to 50 g per day (eat plenty of vegetables though)

- Moderate protein

- Don’t go low-fat

- Intermittent fasting: 3 meals with no snacks (and if you’re not hungry, don’t eat)

Is keto beneficial to menopausal women? Yes. You want to do keto and get into ketosis, especially if you’re going through menopause. Healthy Keto is the healthiest way, and the lowest- stress way, to lose belly fat.
