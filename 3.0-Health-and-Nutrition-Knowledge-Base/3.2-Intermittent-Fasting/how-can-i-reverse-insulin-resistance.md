# How can I reverse insulin resistance?

In Dr. Eric Berg’s opinion, it takes about 3 to 8+ months to reverse insulin resistance. His guess is that a Healthy Keto® diet with intermittent fasting is responsible for 90%+ of the improvements. Healthy Keto provides the key nutrients you need to help speed up the process.

If you want to enhance your results, you can:

- Add exercise

- Lower your stress

- Get more sleep

- Get plenty of nutrients (zinc, vitamin D, chromium, potassium, magnesium)
