# Is fasting healthy for a diabetic?

In the United States alone, there are about 84 million people who are pre-diabetic and 30 million who are diabetic. There is also a large number of people who have insulin resistance and are on their way to becoming a diabetic. 

**There are two main mechanisms with diabetes medications:**

1\. Targeting insulin resistance 

2\. Increasing insulin

The medications that increase insulin also increase the risk of cardiovascular mortality by 59-68%.  What you need to realize is that high insulin is just as damaging as high blood glucose. You need normal insulin, but you don’t need tremendous amounts of insulin. If you combine therapeutic fasting, where you’re making sure you’re getting all of your nutrients, with a low-carb diet—this can produce amazing results. 

**A few benefits of fasting for diabetics might be:**

1\. Within 4 months—no need for insulin 

2\. A decrease in A1C

3\. A decrease in waist size 

4\. Able to control blood sugars
