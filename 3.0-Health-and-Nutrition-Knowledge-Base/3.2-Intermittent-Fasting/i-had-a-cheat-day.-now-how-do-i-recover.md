# I had a cheat day. Now how do I recover?

Take these nutrients individually to recover faster from a cheat meal: 

- Magnesium

- Potassium

- Vitamin B1

- Vitamin D

They will help stabilize your blood sugar, improve insulin resistance, and buffer the effects of high sugar to a certain degree.

Incorporate exercise to burn up the excess sugar that you have consumed.

Get right on a fasting program. Fast longer to make up the damage from the cheat meal. This will bring your insulin back down to where you need it to be, and your body will burn up the excess sugar and tap into fat again.

When you go off the keto plan do not spread this out over a long period of time. Do it for a short period of time and get right back on. The longer you are off, the harder it will be to get back.
