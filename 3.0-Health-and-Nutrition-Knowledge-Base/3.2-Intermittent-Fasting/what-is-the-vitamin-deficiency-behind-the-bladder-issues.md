# What is the vitamin deficiency behind the bladder issues?

**A vitamin B1 deficiency could lead to problems, including:**

• Leaky bladder

• Incomplete urination

• Frequent urination

• Getting up in the middle of the night to urinate

The common thread behind these bladder issues is actually a problem with the nervous system. The main control with urine elimination stems from the brain, and this part of the brain is very sensitive to a vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. A thiamine deficiency in the brain can even starve off certain neurons, causing a lack of function. The part of the brain that controls the bladder can shrink, leading to a loss of control of the bladder. This situation is common with age and in those with diabetes, prediabetes, or chronic insulin resistance.

**Natural tips to get rid of bladder issues:**

1\. Take vitamin B1 (benfotiamine and natural B1)

2\. Get on the Healthy Keto® diet and do intermittent fasting

3\. Drink 2.5 liters of fluid a day (not past 6 pm or 7 pm)

4\. Consume apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 TBSP in water)

5\. Reduce caffeine consumption

6\. Massage the bladder
