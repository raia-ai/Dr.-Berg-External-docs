# What are the most effective natural methods to enhance testosterone levels?

1\. Increase your cholesterol intake - Do not go on a low-fat diet! Cholesterol is a precursor to testosterone.

2\. Moderate protein - High amounts of protein can cause insulin to spike, which can disrupt a healthy hormone balance. 6-8 oz of meat per meal should be plenty.

3\. Lower your carbs - Carbohydrates boost your insulin levels, which can lower your T level. A low-carb diet such as keto is ideal for boosting your testosterone naturally. Add intermittent fasting for an extra boost.

4\. Exercise - High-intensity interval training (HIIT) will help stimulate testosterone.

5\. Sleep - Getting enough sleep is vital to normal and healthy hormone levels. Poor quality and duration of sleep can cause an increase in cortisol, which can throw off your testosterone level. Long walks are great for getting better sleep and lowering cortisol.

6\. Lower your estrogen - Testosterone and estrogen oppose each other. If you have high estrogen, you will have lower testosterone. Avoid soy and non-organic products.

7\. Supplements - Zinc, Korean red ginseng, L-arginine, and D-aspartic acid are great supplements for supporting healthy testosterone levels.

The last couple of things I want to mention is that a fatty liver, high iron levels, and statin drugs may also cause low testosterone levels. Make sure you talk with your doctor about these potential problems.
