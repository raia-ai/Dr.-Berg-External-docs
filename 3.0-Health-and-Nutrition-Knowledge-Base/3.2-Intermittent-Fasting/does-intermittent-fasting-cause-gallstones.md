# Does Intermittent Fasting cause gallstones?

When we don't eat, we concentrate our bile up to 20x, and the more concentrated it is, the better to ensure we do not get stones. Also saturated fat triggers the release of bile and low fats dry up bile. Its the lack of bile that causes gallstones, not the excess. High carbs tend to lower your bile and cause gallstones as well.
