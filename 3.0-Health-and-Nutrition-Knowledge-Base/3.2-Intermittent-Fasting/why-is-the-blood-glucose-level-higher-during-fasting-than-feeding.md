# Why is the blood glucose level higher during fasting than feeding?

Blood glucose levels may be higher while fasting than when you are feeding. Below are some potential reasons why. Please consult with a medical professional to determine if an underlying medical condition may affect your individual health outcomes.
Dawn phenomenon: This is a natural rise in blood glucose levels in the early morning hours, a process regulated by the release of counter-regulatory hormones like cortisol, growth hormone, and glucagon. If the fast ends in the morning, this could contribute to higher glucose levels, but it's a normal part of your body's function.

Gluconeogenesis: The liver produces glucose through gluconeogenesis to maintain blood sugar levels. This process can happen while feeding but is most increased at the 12-24 hour point of a fast, sometimes leading to a temporary increase in blood glucose.

Insulin resistance: Fasting can temporarily increase insulin resistance, which may result in higher blood glucose levels when the fast ends.

Stress response: Fasting is a form of stress on the body, which can trigger the release of stress hormones like cortisol. It's important to acknowledge that this can raise blood sugar levels, but it's a normal part of fasting.

Diet: Many foods have a glucose-lowering effect that may reduce blood sugars during feeding.

Individual variation: Some people may experience a paradoxical increase in blood glucose during fasting due to their unique physiology or underlying health conditions.
