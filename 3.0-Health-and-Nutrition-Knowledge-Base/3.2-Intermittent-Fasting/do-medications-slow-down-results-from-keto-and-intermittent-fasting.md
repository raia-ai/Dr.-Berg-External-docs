# Do medications slow down results from Keto and Intermittent Fasting?

Metformin and Insulin will definitely slow the results because the goal is to lower insulin. Steroids are an injection for inflammation and skin problems can block your keto results. Anti-Depressants could slow the results and will give you side effects such as weight gain and statins worsen the results.
