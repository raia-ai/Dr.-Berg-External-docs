# What's the difference between fasting and starvation?

Fasting is when you deplete the glycogen reserves (stored sugar in the liver and the muscles) and fat for energy. Starvation differs because it means you have already depleted your glycogen and fat reserves, and the body is now breaking down muscles and organs are breaking down for fuel.

Fasting is healthy because it helps your body repair damaged cells while purging necessary fat and glycogen reserves. Starvation is extremely damaging and causes long-term health problems and even death if left unaddressed.
