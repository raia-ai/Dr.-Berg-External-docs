## **The Role of Liver and Adrenals in Blood Sugar Regulation**

Regarding [intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-7-important-intermittent-fasting-rules), the liver and adrenal glands play a crucial role in stabilizing blood sugar levels. These two organs work together to prevent hypoglycemic reactions, making fasting more challenging and dangerous for some people.

I've seen firsthand how important it is to maintain the health of your liver and adrenals if you want to succeed with intermittent fasting. Let's look at how these organs function and what you can do to support them.

### **Understanding Hypoglycemia and Its Impact**

[Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-hypoglycemia-tip), can cause unpleasant symptoms like dizziness, irritability, and difficulty concentrating.

For people practicing intermittent fasting, these symptoms can be especially problematic and may even lead to fainting or seizures in severe cases.

It's essential to recognize the signs of hypoglycemia so you can take steps to prevent it from derailing your fasting efforts. Some common symptoms include:

- Shakiness or trembling

- Rapid heartbeat

- Sweating

- Confusion or difficulty focusing

- Irritability or mood swings

### **The Interplay Between Liver Health and Blood Sugar Levels**

The liver plays a vital role in regulating blood sugar by storing excess glucose as [glycogen](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-glycogen) and releasing it into the bloodstream when levels drop too low.

However, liver damage from conditions like fatty liver disease or cirrhosis can impair this function, making it harder to maintain stable blood sugar during fasting periods.

When the liver cannot store and release glucose effectively, you may experience more frequent or severe hypoglycemic episodes. This can make intermittent fasting feel like an uphill battle, even if you do everything else right.

According to Dr. Berg, "Hypoglycemic reactions can be prevented by the adrenals and the liver." So if you're struggling with low blood sugar during fasting, it's worth taking a closer look at the health of these two key organs.
