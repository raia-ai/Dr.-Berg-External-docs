# How is intermittent fasting connected to blood sugar levels and the adrenal glands?

When transitioning between meals, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) may occur. Normally, the adrenals and liver raise glucose levels. Weak adrenals can lead to severe drops in blood sugar, causing symptoms. Strong adrenals typically prevent hypoglycemia during intermittent fasting (IF). IF isn't harmful to adrenals, but with weak adrenals, it should be approached gradually, incorporating more fat, B vitamins, and potassium.
