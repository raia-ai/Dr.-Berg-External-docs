# Can my intermittent fasting window be flexible?

Yes, your intermittent fasting window can be flexible. It's beneficial to adjust it and see what works best for you. For instance, you might try shifting your eating timesâ€”perhaps starting with a first meal earlier in the day and finishing with a second meal by mid-afternoon. Experimenting with different schedules can help you find the optimal routine.
