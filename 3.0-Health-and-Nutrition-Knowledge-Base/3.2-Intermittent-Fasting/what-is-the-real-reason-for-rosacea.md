# What is the real reason for rosacea?

Rosacea is when your cheeks become really red and it looks like there’s a broken blood vessel. There is a huge connection between rosacea and SIBO or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

SIBO is a situation where the bacteria that should be in the large colon are growing in the small intestine. The main cause of SIBO is malnutrition.

What NOT to do:

1\. Add Probiotics – You already have too many microbes.

2\. Add Fiber – These microbes in the small intestine eat fiber.

What you SHOULD do:

1\. Smaller Vegetables – Cut down the amount of vegetables that you are consuming.

2\. Clove, Oregano, Garlic – These are great natural antibiotics

3\. Intermittent Fasting – There is a certain process that happens between meals that occurs in the gut and cleanses any residue of food and particles and pushes it down into the digestive tract into the large bowel.

4\. Apple Cider Vinegar (and Betaine Hydrochloride) – One of the most important things to do is to acidify the stomach because these microbes can’t live in an acidic environment.

One of the causes of SIBO is low stomach acid.

Causes of Low Stomach Acid:

• Antibiotics

• Anti-acids

• Junk food

• Too much baking soda
