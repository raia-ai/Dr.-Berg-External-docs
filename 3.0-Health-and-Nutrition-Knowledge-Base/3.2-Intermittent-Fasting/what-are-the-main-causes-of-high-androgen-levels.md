# What are the main causes of high androgen levels?

Excess androgens, male sex hormones present in both men and women, lead to symptoms like facial hair, hair loss, and PCOS in women, and hair loss and prostate issues in men.

**Causes and Remedies:**

1\. **Conversion to DHT:**

Enzymes convert testosterone to DHT, exacerbating symptoms:

\- Use spearmint tea, red reishi mushroom, licorice, green tea, black cohosh, chaste tree, and DIM supplements.

2\. **Estrogen Conversion Blockage:**

Glyphosate in non-organic foods inhibits enzyme activity:

\- Avoid GMOs and choose organic foods.

3\. **High Insulin:**

Refined carbs and sugar spike insulin, increasing androgens:

\- Avoid refined carbs, sugar, and snacking; follow Healthy KetoÂ® diet and intermittent fasting.

4\. **High Stress:**

Stress boosts adrenal androgen production:

\- Take vitamin B1, manage stress, improve sleep, and take walks.

\- Supplement with calcium, potassium, and magnesium.

\- Consider adrenal support supplements.

These steps help regulate androgen levels, alleviating associated symptoms and supporting overall health.
