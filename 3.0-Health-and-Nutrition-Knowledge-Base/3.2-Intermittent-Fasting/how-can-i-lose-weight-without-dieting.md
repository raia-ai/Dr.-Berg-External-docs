# How can I lose weight without dieting?

It's very difficult to lose even one pound of body fat without changing your diet. If you eat junk food, you’ll have to burn even more calories to burn extra fat. Weight loss is 15% exercise and 85% diet! You have to change your diet if you want to lose weight. There’s no way around it! Exercise improves fitness, muscle tone, and health, but it is not the key to weight loss and certainly won’t help you lose weight fast.

If you want to lose fat and not just water weight, you have to keep insulin low. Decreasing insulin will also decrease your appetite and cravings. To reduce insulin, you must go on a low-carb diet!

The carnivore diet involves eliminating all carbohydrates and eating meat, eggs, fish, and cheese. This simple diet can help you lose weight fast!

Intermittent fasting is the key to fat loss. It can also help with other health problems, such as inflammation, high blood pressure, diabetes, and depression. Remember, carbs block fat burning.

You can lose weight without changing your diet, but it won't be much!
