# Managing Chronic Conditions with Fasting

Prolonged fasting offers significant benefits for managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and degenerative diseases.

**Diabetes Management**

Fasting improves insulin sensitivity and regulates blood sugar levels, which can help mitigate complications associated with diabetes. Research published in *Diabetes Care* demonstrates that intermittent fasting can enhance insulin sensitivity and lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in individuals with prediabetes.

**Potential Cancer-Fighting Benefits**

Fasting may also have potential in cancer management by inducing ketosis, which deprives cancer cells of glucose needed for growth. A review in *Nature Reviews Cancer* highlights that fasting can enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation while minimizing their side effects.
