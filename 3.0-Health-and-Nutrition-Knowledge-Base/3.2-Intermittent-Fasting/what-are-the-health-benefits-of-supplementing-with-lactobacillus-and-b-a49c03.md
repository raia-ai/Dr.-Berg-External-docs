# What are the health benefits of supplementing with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains?

Many times people will see a doctor because of depression, and the doctor will want to load them up on prescription medications. The problem is that in some situations, the person can never come off of the medication, and the medication can cause serious side-effects.

If you have depression, it may be beneficial to look at your diet and see what could be improved. You may want to consider the heathy keto diet and intermittent fasting. Vitamin D may also be beneficial. Something else that could be very important to do is to fix your gut. There is a huge connection between what’s going on in your large intestine and your overall mood.

It has been found that with major depressive disorder, there are high levels of certain microbes and low levels of other microbes in the gut. These microbes could have a huge influence on your overall mood. There is one microbe in particular that could have many different benefits for someone who is depressed. This microbe is called lactobacillus bifidobacterium.

Lactobacillus bifidobacterium can be found in foods like:

1\. Bulgarian yogurt (high-quality and high-fat yogurt)

2\. Kimchi

3\. Sauerkraut

4\. Cheese

5\. Kefir

6\. Pickles

This microbe could be beneficial because it helps make certain neurotransmitters like GABA and serotonin. Microbes like this one also make vitamins, including B1 and other B vitamins. If you can’t consume these foods on a regular basis, you could try taking a probiotic with lactobacillus in it.
