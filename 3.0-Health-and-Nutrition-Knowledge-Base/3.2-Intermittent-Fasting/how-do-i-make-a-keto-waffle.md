# How do I make a keto waffle?

This is a recipe for a classic almond flour waffle. But you can do so much more with this waffles recipe than just make classic waffles. If you pull a few ingredients from this recipe, you can get a really nice “bready” texture. If you miss bread, the resulting waffle bread can be a great alternative.

**Amazing Low-Carb Waffles Ingredients:**

1 cup almond flour

1 pinch salt

1 tsp baking soda

4 eggs (organic, pasture-raised)

1⁄4 cup FiberYum\\cooking spray (for example, avocado spray)

**Instructions:**

1\. Heat waffle iron per the directions that came with it.

2\. Mix all ingredients above. Do not overmix.

3\. Spray both sides of iron with oil before batter is poured in. Pour batter in and cook per the directions that came with your waffle iron. All are different!

4\. These are best served right away. If not, put them on a cookie sheet and don’t stack. They tend to get soft when stacked.

5\. Add butter and sugar-free syrup or peanut butter, and enjoy!

The following super-easy waffle bread is a variation on the waffle recipe, and cooked just like the waffles above, or as pancakes. The texture and taste make this great to use as a bread replacement! Try it out!

**Waffle Bread
Ingredients:**

1 cup almond flour

1⁄4 tsp salt

1 tsp baking soda

3 Tbsp Fiber Yum (or Vitafiber, etc.) cooking spray for the pan or waffle iron

You can try adding different nuts, seeds, or herbs to this recipe. One with dried onion and poppy will taste like a bagel and would be great with cream cheese. Another one could be made with sunflower and pumpkin seeds, and another with shredded carrots and zucchini. Play with it!

Use the rounds (pancake-size) as “bread” for a cheeseburger – amazing. And it’s fun for the kids to get a sandwich on waffle bread!

Enjoy!
