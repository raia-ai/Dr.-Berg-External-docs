# Protective Effects of Fasting on the Brain

Fasting enhances cognitive function and safeguards brain health through several mechanisms. It increases neuronal plasticity by boosting levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which supports neuron growth and survival, leading to improved learning and memory.

Fasting also offers neural protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain. It promotes the production of antioxidant enzymes that neutralize free radicals, protecting brain cells from damage.

Additionally, fasting triggers autophagy, a process that cleanses brain cells by breaking down and recycling damaged proteins and organelles. This "spring cleaning" helps maintain cellular health and may be particularly beneficial in preventing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.
