# What are the potential causes of joint pain?

Joint pain is a problem that can be resolved by nutrition and proper diet. Certain foods and nutrients can reduce the inflammation and speed the recovery process of your joints and bones.

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiencies**

When you are lacking certain vitamins in your body it can cause a lot of joint pain. This is because these certain vitamins are required for the healthy functioning of your joints and body tissues.

**Vitamin D3** is one of the most powerful natural anti-inflammatory vitamins. It will help with joint pain and reduce inflammation.

**Vitamin K2** is a vital nutrient that helps to move excess calcium deposits from your joints into your bones.

**Vitamin C** helps to develop and repair bones and joints in your body by making collagen (proteins for bones and joints). If you have fatigue in addition to joint pain that’s a good indicator of vitamin C deficiency.

Colostrum is a great anti-inflammatory and a good supplement for joint pain.

**Vitamin D3 (get 20,000 to 40,000 IU daily):**

- Consume cod liver oil

- Get more exposure to the sun

- Take a vitamin D3 supplement

**Vitamin K2** (get 300 to 400 mcg daily):

- Consume vitamin K2-rich foods:

    - grass-fed milk

    - cheese

    - butter

    - goose liver

    - grass-fed organic egg yolks

**Vitamin C:**

    - sauerkraut

    - bell pepper

    - berries

    - raw lemons

**Cause #2: Mycotoxins**

Mycotoxins are various poisons which are released from mold and fungus that can affect your joints and your immune system in a bad way. One thing to know is that consuming refined carbs and sugar will worsen the problem as mold and fungus live on sugar and carbs.
