# What are the initial signs and symptoms that may indicate the onset of dementia, and how can they manifest in daily life?

**They can be:**

1\. A loss of spatial navigation (like forgetting where you parked your car)

2\. Difficulty finding the right words

3\. Confusion

4\. Repeating yourself

The first thing you want to do if you are experiencing dementia symptoms is to start feeding your brain ketones. This will help bypass the degraded glucose absorption mechanism that is starving your brain of fuel and begin to feed the neurons directly.

**There are three ways you can increase your ketones:**

1\. Lower your carbs

2\. Do intermittent fasting

3\. Supply your body with healthy fats, like MCT oil and fatty fish
