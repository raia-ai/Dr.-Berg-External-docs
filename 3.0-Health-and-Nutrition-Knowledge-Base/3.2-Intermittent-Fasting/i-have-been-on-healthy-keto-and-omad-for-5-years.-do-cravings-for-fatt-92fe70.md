# I have been on Healthy Keto and OMAD for 5 years. Do cravings for fatty cheese and sour cream indicate a nutritional deficiency?

I think I would eat those things. Especially if you're craving fat. Consume the fatty cheese. Just make sure it's good quality. If you can find some good European cheese, that's raw. That would be the best for you.
