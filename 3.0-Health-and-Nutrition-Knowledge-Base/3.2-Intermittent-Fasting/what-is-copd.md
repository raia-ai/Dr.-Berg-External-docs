# What is COPD?

COPD, also known as emphysema, presents with symptoms like breathlessness, coughing, and mucus production. It can lead to pulmonary hypertension, stressing the heart's right ventricle and causing edema.

Strategies for managing COPD based on research include:

1\. Tocotrienols: 300 mg daily for potential lung support

2\. Vitamin D: 40,000 IUs to boost immunity and reduce inflammation.

3\. Fasting and keto diet: May help manage inflammation and improve overall health.

4\. Vitamin C: Supports immune function and reduces oxidative stress.

5\. Osha root and Mormon tea: Traditional remedies for respiratory health.

**6\. Vitamin B1: Important for energy and nerve function.**

**7\. Stop smoking: Essential to prevent further lung damage from smoke and nicotine.**

**These methods aim to alleviate symptoms, support lung function, and potentially slow COPD progression.**
