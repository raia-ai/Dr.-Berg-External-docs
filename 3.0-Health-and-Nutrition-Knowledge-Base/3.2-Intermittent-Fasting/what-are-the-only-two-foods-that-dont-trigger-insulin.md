# What are the only two foods that donâ€™t trigger insulin?

Fat and fiber. Now I'm not talking about the fiber in whole grains or added synthetic fibers. I'm talking about fiber from vegetable and then fat as a pure fat.

**What food combinations would be a good combination to consume both fiber and fat if you're trying to keep your insulin low?** Well, what about a salad with olive oil? That would be a good one. Or maybe celery with peanut butter. Or even more tasty yet, some raw cream whipped into whipped cream and then some blueberries which has some fiber in it. These are just things that you can add to your diet either as a food or dessert. That will definitely help you keep that insulin lowered in addition to other benefits.
