# How does exercise function as a natural antidepressant, and what evidence supports its effectiveness in improving mood and alleviating symptoms of depression?

## **Exercise as a Natural Antidepressant**

Finding yourself stuck in the grip of depression can be challenging. But did you know that exercise might help? Yes, moving your body isn't just good for physical health - it's like an antidepressant without a prescription.

### **Exercise's Impact on Energy Levels and Stress**

Regular physical activity is proven to boost energy levels. When we move our bodies, blood circulation improves, bringing more oxygen and nutrients to our cells. This helps us feel more energetic.

Besides giving us an energy lift, exercise also plays a significant role in stress management. It prompts the release of endorphins - our bodyâ€™s natural mood boosters. So, when life gets stressful (as it often does), getting active can provide some much-needed relief.

### **Exercise for Better Sleep**

A consistent workout routine could lead to better sleep, too. Regular exercisers tend to fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep than those who remain inactive. And because good quality sleep is linked with improved mental well-being, this means less room for depressive thoughts.
