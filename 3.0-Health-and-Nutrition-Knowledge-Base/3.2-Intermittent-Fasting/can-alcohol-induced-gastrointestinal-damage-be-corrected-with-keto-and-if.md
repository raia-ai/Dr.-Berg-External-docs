# Can alcohol-induced gastrointestinal damage be corrected with keto and IF?

To a large degree it can. But I think you're going to need some additional things to help correct it. If you do the healthy version of keto and you include more probiotics, and get a nice diversified group of microbes living in your intestine testes that can actually help fortify and help build up the mucus layer that's needed in the GI tract. That mucus layer is really what's missing with so many people and their health problems. And that mucus layer is generated by eating healthy and having enough microbes and making sure they're doing their job. When you lose the mucus layer, you lose your immune system because then you have less of a buffer for these pathogens to invade. And then you start getting autoimmune diseases and inflammatory diseases. That mucus layer is going to be really key to maintain your health and you can have a good start by doing the healthy keto.
