# Is juicing advisable during chemotherapy?

Well, I don't recommend juicing anything on chemo because the fasting during chemo has a really interesting effect of lessening the side effects from chemo and radiation. So it actually gives you more protection, which is pretty wild.

You actuallyâ€”if you fast when you have chemo, you actually will get through a lot better. But as far as juicing in general, maybe you want to get more nutrients, then you're going to have to just do a complete greens type thing and no fruit whatsoever because that fruit is just going to feed the cancer. The greens would be good. Cruciferous green would be good, but I don't know how you feel about juicing cruciferous. It's pretty bitter. But if you did juice a daikon radish, and that's one thing I've tried once.
