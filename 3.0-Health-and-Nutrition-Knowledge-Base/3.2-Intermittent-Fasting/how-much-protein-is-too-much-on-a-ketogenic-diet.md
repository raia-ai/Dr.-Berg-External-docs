# How much protein is too much on a ketogenic diet?

To manage insulin, aim for 3-6 oz of protein per meal, adjusting for fitness and metabolism. For regular workouts, up to 8 oz may be okay. For one meal a day, you might need more protein.

Dr. Berg suggests grass-fed beef, pasture-raised chicken (with skin), eggs, and wild-caught salmon. Fattier proteins help lower insulin levels.

Calculate your protein needs: body weight (lbs) x 0.4. Divide by your meals per day (2 or 3).

Example: At 172 lbs, you need 68.8g/day. For 2 meals, that's 34.4g/meal.

Adjust to find your ideal amount.
