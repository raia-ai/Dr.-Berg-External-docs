# Can I use inositol for PCOS?

PCOS occurs when the androgen male sex hormones are too high in a women’s body. Symptoms include growing facial hair, developing belly fat, and hair loss on your head. You might get a deeper voice.

High levels of androgen are caused by high levels of insulin. So of course you want to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to lower your insulin levels. But there’s a little more to it.

There’s a vitamin called inositol that’s part of the vitamin B family. Interestingly, if you suck on it, it tastes sweet. Inositol is involved in sugar metabolism. Inositol is actually nine different vitamin B compounds, Two of the nine versions are called MYO and D-chiro. I and others believe that in women with PCOS, the MYO doesn’t convert to the d-chiro. So on top of the high levels of insulin and androgens, this contributes to the problem.

When you give women with PCOS a 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, their symptoms improve, as does their fertility, weight loss, acne, and the quality of their eggs. Find an inositol supplement that has this 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, to further enhance the benefits of keto and intermittent fasting. Inositol alone won’t completely help. You’ve got to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to get your insulin levels low enough to stop driving up your androgen levels.
