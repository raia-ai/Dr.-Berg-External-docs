# What are the primary causes of Hepatitis C?

Hepatitis C is a viral infection that targets liver cells, leading to inflammation and potentially severe complications like diabetes, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Symptoms include fatigue, flu-like symptoms, dark urine, abdominal pain, and jaundice.

Causes and remedies:

\- **Infection:** Hepatitis C is transmitted through blood contact. Strengthening the immune system is crucial. Adopting the Healthy KetoÂ® diet and intermittent fasting can reduce liver inflammation and aid recovery. Limiting iron intake starves the virus.

\- **Supporting Liver Health:** Consume antioxidants like parsley, cruciferous vegetables, milk thistle, and vitamins (C, E, B complex). Enhance immune function with oregano oil, garlic, and vitamin D. Avoid liver-damaging substances such as alcohol, vegetable oils, and omega-6 fatty acids.

\- **Medications:** Reduce medication intake under medical supervision as some medications can strain the liver.

Managing these factors supports liver recovery and overall health when dealing with hepatitis C.
