# Which supplements or beverages should I consume while fasting?

While fasting, consider adding apple cider vinegar to your routine, as it boosts energy and enhances insulin sensitivity. Mix a tablespoon with water, and add lemon juice for its citrate content, which may help prevent kidney stones.

It's also essential to ensure adequate sea salt intake, especially if you're on a one-meal-a-day plan, to avoid muscle weakness and sleep disturbances. Additionally, using an electrolyte powder rich in potassium and B vitamins is beneficial. These vitamins are crucial for energy production, particularly on a low-carb, high-fat diet.
