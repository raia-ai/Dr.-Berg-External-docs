# Why is lemon juice beneficial for managing gout arthritis but potentially detrimental for osteoarthritis?

Well, it’s actually both. In this video, I want to explain why lemon juice is both good and bad for arthritis.

Gout arthritis - High levels of uric acid.  Gout symptoms get better when you make things alkaline. When you consume lemon juice and it’s metabolized, it turns into an alkaline substance. This makes lemon juice a good remedy for gout. But, the lemon juice remedy for gout is really just a quick fix. It will help you feel better, but you still need to work on the real cause of the issue.

Osteoarthritis - Calcium deposits within the joints.  Osteoarthritis symptoms get worse when things are more alkaline. When you alkalize the body, you can create a flare-up of osteoarthritis. With osteoarthritis, you need to acidify the body by taking apple cider vinegar. 

As a side note, when doing intermittent fasting, your body will produce more uric acid. If you’re sensitive to uric acid, it may cause a flare-up of gout. In this case, you can take lemon juice or potassium citrate to alkalize the body.
