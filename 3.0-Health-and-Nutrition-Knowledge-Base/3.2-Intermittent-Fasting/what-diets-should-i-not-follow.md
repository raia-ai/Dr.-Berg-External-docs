**7 Diets That Can Harm Your Health and Weight Loss Goals**

Beware of these popular diets that often rely on heavily processed ingredients and can sabotage your health and metabolism:

1. **Junk Food Atkins:** The Atkins brand's shakes and bars are loaded with unhealthy ingredients like soy protein isolate, artificial flavors, and polydextrose.

2. **Jenny Craig:** Pre-made meals and the "anytime bar" contain soy protein isolate and synthetic starches like maltodextrin.

3. **Weightwatchers:** While focused on portion control, their Smart Ones brand includes meals with ultra-processed ingredients like soy protein isolates and soybean oil.

4. **Nutrisystem:** Marketed as diabetic-friendly, it uses ingredients like maltodextrin, which has a high glycemic index.

5. **Ideal Protein:** "Wheat protein isolate" is just another name for starch, a chain of sugars.

6. **Optifast:** This medically supervised program relies heavily on shakes, bars, and soups, often with maltodextrin as a primary ingredient.

7. **Medifast:** Despite being "scientifically designed," their products contain soy protein isolates, polydextrose, and other processed ingredients.

**The Bottom Line:**

These ultra-processed ingredients can disrupt your metabolism and contribute to health issues like diabetes and obesity.

**For sustainable weight loss, focus on whole foods and always read ingredient lists!** Don't be fooled by "keto-friendly" labels â€“ prioritize real, nutritious food
