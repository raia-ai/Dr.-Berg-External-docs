# How beneficial is resveratrol??

People who think they have a slow metabolism actually have an efficient metabolism. This means their body requires less fuel. To lose stubborn fat, you must get your body to waste more fuel. The mitochondria are the body's “energy factories,” turning food into stored energy, known as ATP. Uncoupling occurs when the mitochondria make less ATP and more heat.

Resveratrol is a natural mitochondrial uncoupler. It’s found in grapes, cranberries, blueberries, dark chocolate, pistachios, and Japanese knotweed. Resveratrol is also made into a powder supplement. One tablespoon per day can help reduce belly fat by encouraging mitochondrial uncoupling.

Ketones can cause mitochondrial uncoupling and improve the function of the mitochondria. Cold therapy, exercise, fasting, green tea, saunas, and jacuzzis also cause mitochondrial uncoupling.
