## **Understanding Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Techniques**

[Recovering from a stroke](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-to-do-after-a-stroke-important) is a complex process that requires a personalized approach. There's no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to stroke rehabilitation.

The most effective strategies involve a multifaceted approach that addresses both brain health and motor recovery. Let's explore some key techniques that can help optimize the stroke recovery process.

### **The Role of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Healing Brain Damage**

[Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-benefits-of-hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy) is a promising treatment for stroke recovery. It involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized chamber, which allows the lungs to gather more oxygen than possible at normal air pressure.

This increased oxygen supply can help heal damaged brain tissue by reducing inflammation, promoting new blood vessels' growth, and stimulating stem cell release.

While more research is needed, HBOT shows potential as a complementary therapy for stroke rehabilitation.

### **Ketones as an Alternative Fuel for Brain Recovery**

The brain typically relies on glucose for energy, but after a stroke, the brain's ability to use glucose may be impaired. This is where ketones come in.

[Ketones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-t-get-your-ketones-high-enough) are an alternative fuel source for the brain when glucose is unavailable. They can be obtained through a low-carb, high-fat diet, exogenous ketone supplements, [MCT oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-15-benefits-of-mct-or-medium-chain-triglyceride-oil), and intermittent fasting.

By providing the brain with an alternative energy source, ketones may help support brain function and recovery after a stroke.
