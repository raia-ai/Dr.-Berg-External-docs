# How not to get your wife to lose weight? FOR MEN ONLY

The best way to get your wife to lose weight, hands down, is by using cash. Of course, I’m kidding!

First, let’s talk about what not to do. The next time you hug her, don’t pinch her fat. Stop giving her candy, donuts, and other similar items. When you’re at a restaurant and she orders something like bread or pasta, don’t shame her. For Christmas or her birthday, don’t give her presents like a scale, a tape measure, or a gym membership.

Okay, so what can you do? Lead by example. Get yourself in shape. Ask if she wants to come with you to the gym. If she says yes, great. If not, drop it. Send her one of my videos on metabolism. If she wants to watch it, great. If not, drop it. Validate her. Tell her she’s beautiful. Build her up.

If you’ve tried all these positive approaches but they don’t work, then use the cash. I’m joking! Take a positive approach to help your wife lose weight.
