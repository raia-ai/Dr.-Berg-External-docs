# Minutes Of The Meeting July 17, 2025

**Adverse Reaction Log usage reminder**

- Reminder to keep using the **Adverse Reaction Log** for any product-related complaints or reactions.

This data is reviewed by Steve and Maria, and it’s important to complete all required fields in the Excel file.
Even if the report is over 30 days old, a refund may still be processed—just make sure the full procedure from the KB article is followed.

**II. Performance Stats Update**

- **Missed calls** will now be counted under **outbound call stats** and no longer reflected as a separate stat in the overall performance numbers.

This avoids double credit and ensures more accurate reporting. A quick audit confirmed that missed calls were already being credited under outbound.

---

**III. Feedback Survey & Call Closings**

- Reminder to be intentional about **adding survey reminders** during call closings.

The company’s goal is to reach 25–30% feedback response rate. Closing spiels should be warm, concise, and encourage customers to respond to the one-question survey sent after the call. See Section VI for examples shared by the team.

**IV. System & Process Updates**

**Replacement Processing & Expiration Management**

- When sending replacements, manually edit the **expiration or lot number** in propack before the item is shipped.
    This only applies if the order is still in “Accepted” status. If it’s not, reach out to the warehouse to request that they revert the order to accepted so edits can be made.
    Wait for the replacement to sync with ProPack (about 10 minutes) before making updates.

**Amazon Reshipments**

- Tag **CS Leadership** (Ava, Jane, or Cathy) for Amazon reshipments. Do **not tag Roxanna M.** anymore.

These requests will now be entered manually in NetSuite by the CS team for faster turnaround. The same “Amazon Reshipment” work item can be used, just assign it to one of the current processors moving forward.

**V. QA & CS Best Practices Reminders**

**Missing Items (Undamaged Packages)**

- If a customer reports missing items but the package is **not damaged or tampered with**, send an email to PROPACK.
    Include the **order number**, **replacement number** (if already processed), and a list of the **missing items**. This allows PROPACK to issue a refund to the company.

**Order & Refund Calls**

- For phone orders:

- Always verify the customer’s **email address** and **shipping address**.

- Inform the customer of the **expected delivery timeframe** (3–8 business days).

- For refunds:

- Clearly state the **refund timeline** (typically 3–5 business days depending on the bank).

- Let the customer know they can check with their bank or contact us if the refund hasn’t posted by then.

**First Contact Resolution (FCR)**

- Always aim to resolve issues on the **first customer interaction**.

Offer appropriate options (refund/replacement) immediately if the issue is valid. If images are needed, the core resolution should still be provided upfront.
Avoid responses like “we’ll check with the warehouse” unless truly needed, and make sure subscriptions are cancelled during the same call if the refund is related to an unwanted recurring order.

**Account Notes & Documentation**

- When customers use **multiple email addresses**, make sure to **notate both accounts** in CRM.
    This avoids confusion in future tickets or calls and ensures all relevant data is accessible.

**Troubleshooting Resource Links**

- If a customer reaches out about **broken or missing links** from Dr. Berg’s website or YouTube channel, check the content yourself before escalating.
    Many customers get confused when Dr. Berg references a “link below” that may not be there or doesn’t work. Escalate only when necessary and after verifying the issue.

**System Issue Validation**

- Before escalating system concerns (e.g., CRM issues or loading errors), **test across multiple browsers or channels**.
    Confirm the issue internally before submitting a critical ticket or tagging IT.

**VI. Sample Call Closings**

Here are some of the common call closing lines shared by the team:

- “Thank you for calling Dr. Berg Nutritionals. You’ll receive a one-question email survey after this call—we’d really appreciate your feedback!”

- “Your order confirmation and tracking details will be emailed to you shortly. And once we hang up, a short survey will be sent to your inbox.”

- “If you could take a moment to complete the survey after this call, it really helps us out. Thank you again for choosing Dr. Berg!”

Friendly touches such as “Have a great day!” or “Enjoy your weekend!” help make the conversation feel warmer and more personal.
