# How long does Keto breath last?

It can last from a few days up to 3 weeks. It is usually a sign of keto adaptation.

What you need to do is:

- Be strict with your carbs, bringing them below 20 grams per day

- Do intermittent fasting as this will speed things up and drop insulin

- Consume a little more fluid with electrolytes to encourage the body to release ketones out of the urine instead of in your breath

- Consume more foods with chlorophyll (in vegetables)
