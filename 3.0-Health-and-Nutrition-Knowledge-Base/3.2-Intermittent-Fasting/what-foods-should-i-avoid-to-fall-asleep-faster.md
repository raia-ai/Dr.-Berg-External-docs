# What foods should I avoid to fall asleep faster?

**Things that can prevent sleep:**

**1\. Snacking**

When you snack, you’re triggering insulin, which can lead to insulin resistance. This can cause frequent urination at night and sleep apnea.

**2\. Sugar**

Consuming sugar can lead to insulin resistance. It can also deplete your potassium. Potassium relaxes the body.

**3\. Protein**

Protein is a stimulant and will wake you up. Make sure you only have a moderate amount of protein with vegetables. Also, make sure you don’t have your protein too late at night.

**4\. Coffee and tea**

Coffee and tea contain caffeine, which is a stimulant. One small cup of coffee or tea without sugar is fine.

**5\. Alcohol**

Alcohol can dehydrate you, affect your liver, and affect your hormones, which can keep you up at night.

**6\. Protein and sugar**

Combining protein and sugar will raise insulin and can lead to insulin resistance, which will prevent sleep.

**7\. Drinking excessive amounts of water**

Drink when you’re thirsty. Having lemon juice or apple cider vinegar with your water is more hydrating than water alone.
