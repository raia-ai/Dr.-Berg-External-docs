# What happens with a body during a fast?

There are a wide range of benefits that the body experiences during a fast. After about 12 hours, the body begins to produce more growth hormone, which helps boost fat-burning, assists with protein synthesis, benefits joints, and can even have some anti-aging effects.

After about 18 hours of fasting, the body begins a process known as autophagy, which recycles old and damaged proteins and cells, turning them into new ones. After a day of fasting, the body will begin to burn fat instead of glygogen, antioxidant and oxygen reserves will increase, the cardiovascular system becomes more efficient, alongside many more benefits. Fasting over 48 or 72 hours can result in the production of more stem cells and better immune function. However, you should never begin a prolonged fast without consulting a medical professional first.
