# Under what specific circumstances can autophagy be enhanced or regulated?

Autophagy is the body's process of recycling damaged proteins and addressing certain microbes and pathogens, thereby generating new proteins and fuel. It's essential for maintaining cellular health and has notable preventative benefits, including cleaning up damaged mitochondria.

Recent cancer therapies aim to inhibit autophagy, as cancer cells can exploit this process for resources. Despite this, promoting autophagy through prolonged fasting is beneficial, even in cancer cases, due to the numerous positive genetic effects it induces against cancer. Encouraging autophagy is advantageous for overall health and cancer prevention.
