# What are the most effective strategies for supporting pancreatic health, and how can these methods help prevent pancreatic disorders and maintain overall metabolic well-being?

Dr. Berg recommends several strategies to support a healthy pancreas:

1. **Dietary Adjustments**:

    - **The HealthyÂ® Keto Diet**: This diet encourages a low-carbohydrate lifestyle to manage and potentially reverse insulin resistance, which is crucial for pancreatic health.

    - **Intermittent Fasting**: Incorporating fasting into your routine can improve insulin sensitivity and support pancreatic health.

    - **Avoid Refined Carbohydrates and Sugars**: These are known triggers for insulin resistance, particularly in individuals with a pancreas body type.

2. **Natural Supplements**:

    - **Berberine**: This supplement helps regulate blood sugar levels and supports the cells in your pancreas responsible for insulin production.

    - **Beef Pancreas Extract**: Provides direct support to the pancreas.

    - **Milk Thistle**: Known for improving insulin sensitivity and supporting liver health, which is indirectly beneficial for pancreatic function.

3. **Lifestyle Modifications**:

    - **Regular Exercise**: Including interval training can help maintain healthy growth hormone levels, which are essential for overall endocrine health.

    - **Adequate Sleep**: Ensuring good quality sleep to support overall hormonal balance and reduce stress on the pancreas.

These strategies aim to enhance pancreatic function and overall metabolic health, thereby supporting better blood sugar management and reducing the burden on the pancreas.
