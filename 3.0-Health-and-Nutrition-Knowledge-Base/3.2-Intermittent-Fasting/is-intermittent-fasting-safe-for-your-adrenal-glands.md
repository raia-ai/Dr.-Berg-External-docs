# Is intermittent fasting safe for your adrenal glands?

It's normal for cortisol to counter low blood sugar levels. During intermittent fasting, as your blood sugar drops, cortisol, an adrenal hormone, kicks in to prevent this. This is a normal function of cortisol, just like how it increases white blood cells and inflammation during infection and injury. These processes don't stress the adrenals; they're part of cortisol's purpose. To address this, you may need to fix both your insulin resistance and adrenal function separately.
