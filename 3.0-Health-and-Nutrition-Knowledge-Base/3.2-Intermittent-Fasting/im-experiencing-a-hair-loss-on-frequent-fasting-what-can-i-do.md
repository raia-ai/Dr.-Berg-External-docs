# I'm experiencing a hair loss on frequent fasting, what can I do?

Hair loss during frequent or prolonged fasting can sometimes be caused by a lack of essential nutrients. Before starting a fast, it's important to build strong nutritional reserves, just like building muscle for exercise. To ease into fasting, start with a healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting with three meals a day. As your body adjusts, gradually skip meals until you reach one meal a day. Extend fasts slowly and carefully. The key is to listen to your body and progress at a comfortable pace.

**Supplement:**

- **Amino Acids (Dr. Minkoff Brand)**\-For healthy hair growth, your body relies on a steady supply of protein's building blocks, called amino acids. Diets lacking sufficient protein can disrupt this process and lead to hair growth problems.

- **Trace Minerals** -While a wide range of trace minerals impact hair health, iron, zinc, copper, silicon, and selenium play particularly vital roles in supporting hair follicle function and hair growth.

- **B-Vitamins** - are essential for hair growth because they support two key factors: healthy cell replication (which hair follicles rely on for rapid growth) and strong blood circulation to the scalp (which delivers vital nutrients to the hair follicles).

- **Whole Food Multivitamin** -Gives your body the nutrient reserves it needs to help prevent hair loss during periodic and prolonged fasting.

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do *not* encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provides this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast.  If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**
