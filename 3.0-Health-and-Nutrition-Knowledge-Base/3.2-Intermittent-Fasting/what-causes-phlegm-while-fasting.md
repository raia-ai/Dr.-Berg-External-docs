# What causes phlegm while fasting?

I wouldn't worry too much about that. It could be one of the transition things you're going through. Of course, phlegm is part of the immune reaction. It could be just something that you can compensate with taking something like Spanish black radish or maybe something that's high in sulfur to help clean out your glands and things like that.
