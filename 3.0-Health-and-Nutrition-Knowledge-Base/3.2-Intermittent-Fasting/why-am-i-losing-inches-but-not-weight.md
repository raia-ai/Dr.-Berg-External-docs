# Why am I losing inches but not weight?

**There is nothing more frustrating than doing everything right with keto and intermittent fasting, and still not losing weight.** 

**Even if you're losing inches but not losing weight, the ketogenic diet is still working:**

• If you're losing inches

• If your hunger is going away

• If you're not craving anymore

• If you have more energy

A slow metabolism really is insulin resistance. Insulin is an anabolic hormone. If insulin is not working, you're not going to have the anabolic effect. As soon as you do keto and intermittent fasting, you're going to fix insulin resistance.  Once you fix insulin resistance, you're going to absorb more protein. Protein weighs more than fat per the same volume. This means, initially, you will lose inches but not weight. 

**This is because you're:**

• Absorbing protein

• Getting more muscle mass

• Fixing atrophy 

If you're not losing weight on keto, keep in mind that it is working. You're getting healthier. You have to get healthy to lose weight, not lose weight to get healthy.
