# Does Keto help with candida infection?

A few symptoms of Candida are achiness of joints, fatigue, itchiness of the body, and digestive issues just to name a few. You want to stay away from sugar, birth control pills can accelerate it as well as stress.

Doing intermittent fasting for at least 18 hours or more will put your body in an autophagy state in which the body would eliminate yeast, mold, fungus, and candida. Adding Thyme oil, grapefruit, and seed extract can help with the healing process.
