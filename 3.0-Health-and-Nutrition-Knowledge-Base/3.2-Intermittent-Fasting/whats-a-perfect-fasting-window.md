# What's a perfect fasting window?

Research has found the optimum time of fasting is between 18-24 hours. So if your time of eating (window of eating) is 6 hours, and let's say you eat at 12 noon and then again at 6, this gives 6 hours of eating and 18 hours of fasting. Then, you can slowly adjust your body and graduate to shorter eating windows, until you are fasting for long periods with no discomfort.

If your metabolism is slow and you suffer from insulin resistance, you may benefit greatly from eating only one meal a day, or OMAD. This, in combination with proper sleep and exercise (particularly HIIT training), can boost weight loss efforts, improve insulin sensitivity, and support overall health.
