# What is a speed keto diet plan?

For those on the Healthy KetoÂ® diet seeking to enhance intermittent fasting, ensure you're already following these steps:

\- Intermittent fasting with 1 to 2 meals within 4 hours

\- Ketogenic diet with less than 20 grams of carbs per day

\- Plenty of salad, moderate protein, and sufficient healthy fats

\- Avoidance of soy oil and regular exercise

To elevate your progress:

1\. Avoid starchy vegetables like squash, corn, and carrots.

2\. Enhance insulin resistance with potassium, Vitamin D, plant-based trace minerals, and Vitamin B1.

3\. Incorporate full-body high-intensity exercise twice a week with adequate recovery.

4\. Manage stress using techniques like acupressure to reduce cortisol levels.

5\. Consider choline supplements if you have a fatty liver.
