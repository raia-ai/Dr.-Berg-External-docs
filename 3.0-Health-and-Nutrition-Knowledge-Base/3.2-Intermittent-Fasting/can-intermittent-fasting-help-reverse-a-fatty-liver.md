# Can Intermittent Fasting help reverse a fatty liver?

Fasting is one of the most important things you can do if you have a fatty liver.  One way to know if you have a fatty liver is to simply look down at your stomach. If your stomach bulges out, chances are you have a fatty liver. You can also get a biopsy or an ultrasound to be sure.  When the liver becomes filled with fat, it spills off into areas around and inside the organs. This is why people start developing a gut. 

What causes fatty liver?

**• Sugar or refined carbohydrates**

When you consume glucose, your whole body can deal with it. But, when you consume fructose, the liver is stuck dealing with it. Indirectly your insulin will spike, and other problems with occur. The effects of fructose on the liver are very similar to the effects of alcohol on the liver. 

**A few sources of fructose you might not have thought of:**

• High fructose corn syrup 

• Fruit juice 

• Agave 

**The best way to handle a fatty liver is to reverse the flow. You have to fast. You want to work up to about 20 hours of fasting—23 hours would be even better. Don’t eat unless you’re hungry and go for as long as you can.** 

**A few more things to help speed up the process:**

• Take choline (and B vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast)

• Exercise 

• Bile salts
