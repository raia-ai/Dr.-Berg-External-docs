# Is fasting for 24 hours good?

Apart from promoting weight loss, fasting for 24 hours has other health benefits, including supporting metabolic health, lowering inflammation, and allowing the lining of the digestive tract to regenerate. 

Fasting also triggers autophagy, a natural process that clears cellular debris and damaged cell components linked to premature aging and an increased risk of age-related diseases and cancer.  

*Please make sure to consult a healthcare provider before you start a fast.*
