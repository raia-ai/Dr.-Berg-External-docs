# Why is my stomach bloated when I haven't eaten?

Eating too much during the eating window is a common cause of bloating while fasting. Overeating can strain the digestive system, leading to poor digestive processes and bloating hours after eating. 

In addition, dehydration can cause chronic constipation, which can lead to gas buildup and bloating, irrespective of food intake.
