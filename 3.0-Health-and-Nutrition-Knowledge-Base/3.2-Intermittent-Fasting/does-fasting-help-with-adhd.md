# Does fasting help with ADHD?

Some fascinating research shows that intermittent fasting and prolonged fasting may significantly affect the brain's frontal lobe and create significant improvements in cognition. 

**Fasting may potentially help improve cognitive functions, including:**

• Focus 

• Memory 

• Concentration

• Clarity 

• Creativity 

**The study relates to improving the front part of the brain, which is involved with:**

• Paying attention

• Making decisions

• Organizing 

• Planning 

Experts will say that ADHD is a chemical imbalance, that it's genetics, or that the brain is somehow rewired for these symptoms. But, these theories have never been proven. There are medications, but they have side effects that may even potentially create the same symptoms they're supposed to get rid of. 

Basically, with fasting, you stop feeding the brain glucose. As a survival mechanism, the body switches over to making a preferred source of fuel called ketones.  Certain parts of the brain need glucose, but the body can make the glucose it needs from non-carbohydrate sources like fat and protein. You don't need to consume glucose to feed the brain glucose. 

When you fast, you give the brain ketones. Ketones can do many incredible things, including potentially improving cognitive functions. 

**If you have any problems with focus, concentration, or clarity, you may want to try fasting as well as a few other things, including:**

• Vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast) 

• Zinc 

• Omega-3 fatty acids
