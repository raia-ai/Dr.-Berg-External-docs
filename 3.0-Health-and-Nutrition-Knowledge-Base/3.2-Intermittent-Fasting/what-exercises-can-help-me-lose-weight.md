# What exercises can help me lose weight?

The type of calories you burn depends on your diet and exercise habits. If you consume sugar, you’re going to burn sugar calories. If you consume fat without sugar, you’ll burn fat. Avoid overtraining, which increases cortisol and can deplete protein from your muscles.

Calorie burning largely depends on the health of your mitochondria. Your energy levels, recovery time, and endurance can indicate whether your mitochondria are healthy. Certain medications like statins weaken the mitochondria.

To increase and strengthen your mitochondria, do the following:

• Exercise with adequate rest

• Focus on thyroid health

• Increase muscle mass

• Intermittent fasting

• Cold therapy

• Consume meat

Metabolomics can examine mitochondria to determine whether they’re getting enough fuel. Insulin resistance can destroy mitochondria. Growth hormone can reduce insulin resistance, help you build more muscle, and burn more fat. If your diet is too high in carbs, you won’t be able to burn fat. This is why it’s essential to look beyond calorie burning. Fat burning is only 15% exercise and 85% diet. The type of exercise that will help you burn the most calories is something that is high-intensity and involves as many muscles as possible.
