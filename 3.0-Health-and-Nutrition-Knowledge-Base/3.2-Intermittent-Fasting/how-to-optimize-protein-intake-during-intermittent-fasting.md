# How to optimize protein intake during intermittent fasting?

**Optimizing Fat Loss and Muscle Preservation with a Ketogenic Diet and Intermittent Fasting**

Combining a ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting is an effective strategy for enhancing fat loss while preserving muscle mass. To maximize benefits, strategically time your protein intake during your eating window.

**Adjusting Protein Intake**

Distribute your protein intake evenly across meals. Aim for 21 to 42 grams of high-quality protein per meal to support muscle protein synthesis and satiety.

**Fasting and Muscle Preservation**

Intermittent fasting helps preserve muscle mass during calorie restriction by increasing growth hormone release, which supports lean tissue maintenance and fat burning. Studies suggest that intermittent fasting may reduce the protein required for muscle maintenance, allowing for slightly lower protein intake while still benefiting from muscle preservation.
