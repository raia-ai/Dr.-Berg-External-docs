# What are the most effective methods for repairing liver damage caused by alcohol consumption, and how can one support liver health during recovery?

I recommend the herb Milk Thistle which has amazing properties of liver regeneration. The longer-term fix is to get on ketosis and intermittent fasting by consuming lots of cruciferous vegetables.
