# What is autonomic neuropathy?

Neuropathy means nerve damage. With autonomic, we’re dealing with a part of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system, which controls things automatically. It works on its own. 

The #1 cause of autonomic neuropathy is diabetes. But, you don’t end up with diabetes overnight. It’s a gradual condition that starts with high insulin, which leads to insulin resistance, then prediabetes, and finally, diabetes. Autonomic neuropathy is also a condition that gradually occurs. You could have one or more symptoms, which are really the beginning of this condition.
