# Can a ketogenic diet help reverse kidney disease?

High levels of glucose and insulin create oxidative damage to four tissues; brain (nerves), heart, eye, and kidney. B-hydroxybutyrate that is in ketone can provide an alternative fuel, it also has benefits for the kidney and decreases oxidative stress. Ketosis can counter the damage from a high-carb diet.

**Important Points:**

• Potassium is protective of the kidney

• Certain amino acids can slow progression of kidney damage

• It is important to consume nutrient-dense foods – it protects against the side effects and complications of the oxidation

• low carb diet – it is very beneficial to the kidney

***We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.***
