# What is metabolic consistency?

Consistency is crucial to maintaining the metabolic benefits of keto and intermittent fasting. When you consistently follow a [keto diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/dr-berg-the-benefits-of-healthy-keto-part-1) and stick to your fasting schedule, your body adapts to using fat for fuel efficiently.

However, your metabolism can become confused if you frequently deviate from your keto diet or intermittent fasting routine. This inconsistency can lead to a slowdown in weight loss and a decrease in energy levels. Also, you should avoid doing the [dirty keto diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/dirty-keto-diet).

Staying consistent with your keto and intermittent fasting practices is essential to maintain optimal metabolic health. This means sticking to your macronutrient ratios, avoiding cheat meals, and adhering to your fasting schedule as much as possible.

Remember, your metabolism is a dynamic system that adapts to your dietary habits. Consistency in your keto and intermittent fasting journey can achieve your desired health outcomes and keep your metabolism running efficiently.
