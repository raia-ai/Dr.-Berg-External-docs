# What is the most critical supplement for supporting optimal health in individuals managing diabetes?

Benfotiamine is a synthetic B1. Vitamin B1 is naturally water-soluble. Benfotiamine is a fat-soluble B1 vitamin. This is one of the only synthetic vitamins that I like because it has virtually no side-effects.

I believe every diabetic should be taking benfotiamine. Vitamin B1 is involved in the engine in the mitochondria that involves glucose metabolism. The more glucose you have running through the machine, the higher the blood sugar, and the more depleted of vitamin B1 you’re going to become.

With diabetes, there are four main tissues involved, and B1 can help with all of them:

1\. Nerves/brain - Neuropathy 

2\. Eyes - Retina

3\. Kidney - Nephron

4\. Heart vessels - Microvascular endothelial dysfunction

Benfotiamine:

• 3-5x more absorption

• Protects against oxidation and AGEs

• Decreases A1C

• Protection

When it comes to benfotiamine dosage, consider taking at least 600mg of benfotiamine per day, and you can spread it out. You should also be doing healthy keto and intermittent fasting.
