# What are potential remedies or lifestyle adjustments that could help reduce the frequency of nocturnal urination, and what underlying factors might contribute to this condition?

Nocturia is the urge to urinate at night when you should be sleeping, and it can interfere with your ability to get a good night’s sleep.

Nocturia is usually said to be caused by a bladder infection, a kidney infection, prostate issues, or aging. People with nocturia are not typically urinating a full bladder of urine. This means there must be an issue with the sensors in the bladder or the valve of the bladder.

If there’s too much sugar in the blood, a phenomenon known as osmotic diuresis can occur. This causes excess sugar and water to be excreted, which is why diabetics and people who are obese are at an increased risk for nocturia. If you have sleep apnea, you are also at an increased risk for nocturia.

Insulin resistance is the leading cause of obesity, diabetes, and sleep apnea, all of which lead to nocturia. Research has shown that insulin resistance itself can cause nocturia. The best way to address nocturia is to fix insulin resistance. To do this, stop snacking at night and work towards eliminating snacking altogether. Cut down your carb intake to less than 30 grams per day and do intermittent fasting. To speed things up, try consuming one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water before meals and exercise regularly.
