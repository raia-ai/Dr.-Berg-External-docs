# I have really bad acne. Will keto help me with this?

The Healthy KetoÂ® diet can effectively address acne, eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, and other skin issues by regulating hormonal imbalances. These conditions often stem from high androgen levels, which can lead to increased oil production in the skin and consequently, acne. Insulin plays a significant role in triggering androgens, and its reduction through the combination of keto and intermittent fasting (IF) can help lower androgen levels. IF complements keto by further reducing insulin, offering a powerful approach to managing skin problems by addressing hormonal imbalances.
