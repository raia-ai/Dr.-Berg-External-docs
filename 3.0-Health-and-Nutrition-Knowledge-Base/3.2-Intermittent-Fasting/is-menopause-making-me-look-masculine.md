# Is menopause making me look masculine?

Insulin levels go up and that is what causes polycystic ovarian syndrome – by starting to convert this male hormone, androgen. During menopause, the ovaries work differently. The adrenal glands back up the ovaries and then when you get a sudden spike in cortisol (stress hormone), it can then convert into insulin. High androgen can also be a problem.

Symptoms of High Androgen Levels

• Male Pattern Baldness

• Alopecia – Patches of hair that come out in different places.

• PCOS – Acne, facial hair, hair loss, deep voice

• Infertility

• Deep Voice

• Oily Skin

• Skin Inflammation

• Increased Sex Drive

Cause of High Androgen

• Insulin Levels go up causing PCOS Reasons:

Eating a lot of sugar

The adrenal gland is backing up the ovaries.

• High Cortisol – Sudden spike in cortisol at menopause, which can then convert into insulin.

• Decreased Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) – It is the protein in the liver that helps regulate androgens, keeping them in check.

• During Menopause, the body stops releasing estrogen faster than it stops releasing androgens.
