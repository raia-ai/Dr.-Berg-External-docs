# Is Keto effective without intermittent fasting?

While keto is an effective diet that can improve overall health and reduce insulin resistance on its own, it is much more effective when combined with intermittent fasting. Even on a low-carb diet, the more often you eat, the more often you are raising your insulin levels. Intermittent fasting helps keep insulin levels low, making sure you stay in ketosis and lose weight more effectively. Intermittent fasting will also help you break any snacking habits you may have, further increasing the effectiveness of your keto diet.
