# How can I adjust to incorporating more fat into my diet while on keto?

You may have started eating too much fat or added more too suddenly â€“ more than your digestive system is used to. Cut back a little bit, and gradually increase it. Gallbladder or liver problems could cause difficulties with digesting fat as well.

Taking purified bile salts, choline, or lipase can help with fat digestion.
