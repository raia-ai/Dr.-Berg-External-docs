# Does intermittent fasting boost the immune system?

Fasting improves the function of white blood cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes. Remarkably, 85% of your immune system is located in your gut. Additionally, a process called autophagy helps the body clean up old, damaged parts and flush out microbes such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, yeast, and mold. Intermittent fasting is an excellent tool for reducing allergies, gut inflammatory conditions, and even the risk of certain diseases.
