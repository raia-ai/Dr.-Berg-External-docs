# How can I improve my sleep when on Intermittent fasting plan?

**Sleep is vitally important when you’re on keto and intermittent fasting. Let’s find out how to improve sleep if you’re having challenges.**

A lack of high-quality sleep could be the reason you’re not losing weight. Most of the hard-core fat-burning through the stimulation of growth hormone happens when you’re asleep. Also, fixing insulin resistance and blood sugar problems requires sleep. If you have diabetes, you probably notice that your blood sugars are way off on the days when you didn’t get a good night’s sleep.

Insomnia is a symptom of another problem; insomnia isn’t a disease. Let’s go through some reasons why you may not be getting high-quality sleep.

**The first is frequent eating.** If you’re not doing intermittent fasting, and you eat snacks between meals, that will spike your insulin. You’ll be tired during the day but not be able to sleep at night. So, plus in intermittent fasting. Three meals per day, no snacks, then gradually move to two meals per day, no snacks.

**Second, you may be getting up frequently to urinate.** That’s a problem with insulin resistance. One of the symptoms of diabetes is frequent urination. Doing keto and intermittent fasting correctly will eventually correct the frequent urination. If you want to do a test to determine if you have a problem with insulin resistance, get a test called HOMA-IR.

Or you may have problems with your adrenals caused by accumulated stress in your body. Your body is in a constant state of flight or fight. I suggest a natural sleep aid and massage. If you’re consuming foods that cause you to bloat, such as cruciferous vegetables, that could disrupt your sleep. Start eating regular green lettuce instead, for example. Reduce the amount of cruciferous vegetables you consume, then gradually increase it.

**Lastly, sleep apnea could be the culprit.** It’s a problem of too much insulin. Keto and intermittent fasting will eventually correct it and help improve your sleep.
