# How can I enhance autophagy?

Autophagy is a process where the body removes and recycles damaged or unnecessary cells and cell parts, replacing them with new, undamaged components. This process can be induced by intermittent fasting, as long periods without eating allows the body to focus on repairs. Autophagy is beneficial because it is a neuroprotective state, cadio protective, and can boost the immune system.
