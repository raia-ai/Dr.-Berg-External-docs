# What factors contribute to elevated blood sugar levels in the morning?

This condition, known as the dawn phenomenon, can affect those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or severe insulin resistance. Elevated morning blood sugar can be caused by:

1\. Cortisol spike: Peaks between 6 and 9 am, increasing glucose production.

2\. Type 1 diabetes: Growth hormone spikes can raise blood sugar.

3\. Type 2 diabetes: The liver produces glucose, and hormones like glucagon and epinephrine may elevate blood sugar.

4\. Evening carbs: Consuming high-carb meals the night before.

To manage high morning blood sugar, try adhering to a healthy ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. Exercising, avoiding carbs at night, and drinking diluted apple cider vinegar before bed can all help as well.
