# How can I heal trauma but without medication?

To combat chronic inflammation and enhance healing:

1\. Identify and remove inflammatory triggers from your diet and lifestyle.

2\. Use contrast therapy (hot and cold treatments) to boost circulation and reduce inflammation.

3\. Engage in appropriate exercises to promote healing and circulation.

4\. Regular stretching can improve joint health and reduce inflammation.

5\. Consider supplements like vitamin D, omega-3s, vitamin B3, polyphenols, and methylene blue for tissue repair and inflammation reduction.

6\. Apply pressure opposite to the site of pain for relief and balance.

7\. Try intermittent fasting to combat systemic inflammation.

8\. Explore shockwave therapy for non-invasive pain relief and healing.

Always consult your physician before trying new treatments or supplements.
