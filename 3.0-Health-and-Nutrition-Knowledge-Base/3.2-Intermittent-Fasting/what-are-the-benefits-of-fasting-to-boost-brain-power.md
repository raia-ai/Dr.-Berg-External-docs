# What are the benefits of fasting to boost brain power?

If you have brain fog, memory problems, and mental fatigue, fasting can benefit you. Fasting can stimulate a certain protein called BDNF by up to 400%. This protein can resist the oxidative stress that comes from too frequently eating, as this can cause significant insulin spikes. Fasting can also trigger neurogenesis, which helps regrow nerve cells and greatly benefits the brain by creating new neural pathways, increasing mitochondria, increasing stress resistance, and getting rid of brain fog.
