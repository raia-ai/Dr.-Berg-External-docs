# What are some tips for a balanced and nutrient-dense diet?

1. Focus on [Nutrient-Dense Foods](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-nutrient-dense-food-in-the-world): Fill your plate with whole, unprocessed foods like vegetables, fruits, healthy fats, and lean protein. These foods naturally provide a greater sense of fullness and support stable blood sugar levels.

2. Listen to Your Body's Signals: Learn to differentiate between true hunger cues and emotional eating. This will help you nourish your body when it genuinely needs it and break free from unhealthy eating patterns.

3. Experiment with [Intermittent Fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/intermittent-fasting): If appropriate for you, explore intermittent fasting. This can increase insulin sensitivity and give your digestive system a break, potentially making “moderation” with certain foods more manageable. This doesn't mean you can't enjoy a delicious meal once in a blue moon.

The journey to a healthy relationship with food looks different for everyone.

Incorporating more nutrient-dense whole foods while mindfully approaching those more likely to trigger cravings or blood sugar spikes can create lasting positive change without strict adherence to “everything in moderation."

Always consult a qualified healthcare professional to find a personalized approach that aligns with your unique health needs. Your healthcare provider may even suggest you cut sugar intake or get your sugar fix in a healthy way.
