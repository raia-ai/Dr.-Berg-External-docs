# What vitamin deficiency mimics dementia?

**Vitamin B12: Vital for Brain Health and Beyond**

Vitamin B12 is crucial for brain function. Deficiency can cause symptoms resembling dementia. Here's what you need to know:

- **Why B12 Matters:** Supports healthy brain cells and nerve function.

- **Where to Find It:** It is primarily found in animal products (meat, fish, dairy), though some microbes also produce it. Vegan and vegetarian diets may increase the risk of deficiency.

- **Low Stomach Acid: A Common Culprit:** Stomach acid (HCL) is needed to absorb B12. Age, antacids, and certain medications (like Metformin) can reduce HCL levels.

- **Boosting Stomach Acid:** Betaine hydrochloride may help normalize acidity.

- **Medication Side Effects:** Dementia-like symptoms can be caused by common medications like antacids, sleep aids, blood pressure drugs, and more.

- **Other Potential Nutrient Deficiencies:** Low levels of vitamin B1 (linked to high sugar/carb intake), zinc, and vitamin D can also mimic dementia symptoms.

**Preventing and Addressing B12 Deficiency**

- **Brain-Boosting Diet:** Emphasize fatty fish, seafood, and red meat while following a healthy keto and intermittent fasting plan. This provides B12 and ketones, which are an alternative fuel for the brain.

- **Supplementation:** Betaine hydrochloride may help if low stomach acid is the cause.
