# How to grow your muscles?

**Building Muscle on Keto with Intermittent Fasting**

Keto and intermittent fasting can support muscle growth, but exercise is essential. Here's what you need to know:

- **Intensity Matters:** Muscle growth depends on challenging workouts. Focus on pushing yourself to your limits.

- **Benefits of Fasting:** Fasting boosts human growth hormone (HGH), aiding muscle growth and preservation. Minimize snacking to maximize HGH benefits.

- **The Keto Advantage:** A well-formulated keto plan with intermittent fasting sets the stage for muscle building:

    - 2 meals a day

    - 50g carbs per day

    - 7-8 oz. protein per meal

    - Prioritize sleep

**The Dorian Yates Approach (Advanced)**

Inspired by 6-time Mr. Olympia Dorian Yates, this intense strategy can accelerate results:

1. **Warm-Up:** Light sets prepare your muscles.

2. **Go All Out:** One extremely hard set of 6-8 reps, then assisted reps to push beyond failure.

3. **Controlled Negatives:** Focus on the eccentric (lengthening) phase of each exercise.

4. **Full Recovery:** Work each muscle group once a week for optimal repair.

**Important Notes:**

- **Start Gradually:** If you're new to this intensity, ease in and consider a trainer's guidance.

- **Recovery is Key:** Intense workouts require ample rest for maximum muscle growth.
