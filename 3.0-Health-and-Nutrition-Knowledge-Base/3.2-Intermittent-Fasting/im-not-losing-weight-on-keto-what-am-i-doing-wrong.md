# I'm not losing weight on Keto, what am I doing wrong?

\### Key Tips for Succeeding on the Keto Diet

1\. **Focus on Fat, Not Carbs**: Your body burns fat only when glucose is absent. Avoid hidden carbs like maltodextrin and tapioca starch. Aim for less than 10 grams of carbs per day.

2\. **Mind Your Eating Habits**: Eating too frequently, consuming sugar alcohols, certain nuts, cheese, or specific vegetables can cause bloating and constipation. Snacking spikes insulin, leading to belly fat. Consider intermittent fasting to reduce insulin spikes.

3\. **Adjust for Age and Metabolism**: People over 40 may benefit from eating one meal a day (OMAD) due to a slower metabolism.

4\. **Understand Menopause and Metabolism**: During menopause, cortisol spikes can cause muscle atrophy, which may appear as fat. Keto helps rebuild muscle and heal insulin resistance over time.

5\. **Moderate Protein Intake**: Too much protein can raise insulin levels. Aim for 3-6 ounces per meal, up to 8 ounces if very active.

6\. **Prioritize Health Over Weight Loss**: Focus on overall health improvements, like increased energy, better cognitive function, and improved sleep, to support weight loss and well-being.

By following these guidelines, you'll not only enhance your chances of weight loss but also enjoy various health benefits on the keto diet.
