# How will fasting affect diabetes?

**The difference between type-1 and type-2 diabetes is that type-1 diabetes is characterized by a lack of insulin due to pancreatic damage.**

Type-2 diabetes is characterized by a lack of insulin sensitivity. When you have insulin resistance, your body creates far too much insulin. However, this insulin isn't effective because your insulin receptors can't pull in the insulin. Over time, type-2 diabetes can exhaust the pancreas, causing a reduction in inulin production. In turn, some severe types of type-2 diabetes may require insulin shots.

**Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) has similar side effects as high insulin. Both can cause damage to your nerves and blood vesselsâ€”especially in your eyes, kidneys, arteries, heart, and brain.**

An interesting study on three people found that fasting has the potential to reverse insulin resistance and restore insulin's effects on blood sugar levels. All three patients were able to stop taking insulin. Two of the three patients were able to eliminate all medications, and the other patient eliminated 3 out of 4 medications. These results seem to be due to the fact that lowering your consumption of carbs lowers your need for insulin. Keto and intermittent fasting combined may decrease the need for insulin even further. Make sure you do not stop taking your prescription medications without your doctor's approval. Work with your doctor to get healthier by doing keto and intermittent fasting.
