# How can I regenerate my stem cells?

Here's how to keep your stem cell population at the highest level.

1\. Fasting

Prolonged fasting can boost stem cells naturally. If you can fast for 72 hours, you can boost stem cell production primarily for the gastrointestinal tract, brain, and immune system.

2\. Exercise

Intense exercise is the best way to boost stem cells for your muscles and brain. Exercise also stimulates BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which allows you to make new nerve and brain cells.

3\. Deep sleep

Sleep increases melatonin, which stimulates stem cell regeneration in your brain. Sleep also increases immune and cardiovascular stem cells.

4\. Green tea

Green tea contains the phytonutrient EGCG, which has potent anti-inflammatory properties and can increase stem cells for your brain and liver.

5\. Omega-3 fatty acids

Decreasing inflammation can boost stem cell production. Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory and can increase stem cells for your bones, cartilage, brain, and skin.

6\. Vitamin D Vitamin

D and the sun help maintain blood stem cells that are involved with the immune system. Vitamin D increases new immune cells, prevents the exhaustion of stem cells, and can even increase longevity.

7\. Cold therapy

The cold stimulates brown fat stem cells, which support muscle repair and the mitochondria, decrease inflammation, and increase blood flow.
