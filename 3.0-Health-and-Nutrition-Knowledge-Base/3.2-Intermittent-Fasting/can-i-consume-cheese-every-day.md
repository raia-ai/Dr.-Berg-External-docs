# Can I consume cheese every day?

**Cheese is a great protein source, has probiotic properties, and is low in lactose.**

**The best cheeses are goat cheese and sheep cheese. These cheeses contain A2 casein, which is easier on your digestive system than lactose. Surprisingly, the oldest people in the world consume sheep cheese and goat cheese!**

Cow's milk is around 4% lactose, while cottage cheese and mozzarella cheese vary from 1% to 4% lactose. Goat cheese and sheep cheese are only about .5% lactose. Goat and sheep cheese are higher in protein, vitamin A, vitamin E, folic acid, B vitamins, calcium, and CLA than cow's milk cheese. CLA helps with exercise performance and weight loss.

Around 20% to 30% of the fat in sheep and goat cheese is MCT fat, which is converted directly into ketones. Sheep cheese and goat cheese generate quick energy with little stress on your digestion.

**Cheese from animals who graze at higher altitudes is higher in polyphenols. When you introduce these polyphenols to your mitochondria, it triggers an uncoupling effect. This means it generates extra energy, which is effective if youâ€™re trying to lose weight. Polyphenols also stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis.**

**Research has shown that people who live longest have more mitochondria uncoupling. Other ways to stimulate mitochondrial uncoupling include exercise, cold therapy, fasting, and consuming other polyphenols like sulforaphane, turmeric, and green tea.**
