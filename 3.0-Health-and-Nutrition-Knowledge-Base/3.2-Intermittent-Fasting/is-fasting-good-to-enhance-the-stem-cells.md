# Is fasting good to enhance the stem cells?

A stem cell is a cell that doesnâ€™t have a purpose, that can later be transformed when the body needs a certain cell. There are certain parts of the body that can turnover cells very quickly, while other parts take longer. Prolonged fasts of 72 hours or longer have been shown to enhance the production of stem cells. The fat-burning effect that occurs during long fasts helps to fuel the production of stem cells.
