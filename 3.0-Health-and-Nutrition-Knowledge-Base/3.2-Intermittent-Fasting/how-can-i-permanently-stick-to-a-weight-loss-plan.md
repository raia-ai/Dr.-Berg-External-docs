# How can I permanently stick to a weight loss plan?

**The biggest reasons people can’t stick to a diet are #1 hunger and #2 cravings.** 

**There are two main hormones involved in hunger and cravings:**

1\. Ghrelin — This hormone makes you hungry, so we want to decrease it. 

2\. Leptin — This hormone makes you feel satisfied, so we want to increase it. 

**The best ways to stick with your eating plan and lose weight:**

• Get more sleep 

• Decrease sugar 

• Consume an adequate amount of protein

• Get plenty of fiber 

• Decrease stress 

• Avoid alcohol and smoking 

• Keep caffeine consumption to a minimum 

• Consume healthy fats 

• Eat slowly 

• Decrease carbohydrates 

• Take l-tryptophan (for cravings during menstrual cycles)

• Consume nutrient-dense foods 

• Do intermittent fasting

Gastric bypass and certain medications can also increase hunger. 

One of the big tips for sticking to diets and losing weight is to eat frequent small meals. But, every time you eat, you increase insulin.  In the presence of insulin, you can’t burn fat, and if you can’t burn fat, then you can’t lose weight. This can also cause insulin resistance, which can lead to a myriad of health concerns.  Eating less frequently, also known as intermittent fasting, is one of the best things you can do to lose weight and support your overall health. 

To stay satisfied between meals without eating snacks, you need to feed the cells your body fat (burn fat). But, to burn fat, you have to lower your insulin by lowering your carbohydrates and eating less frequently.  Once your body has adapted to burning fat, not only will you be able to lose weight, you will finally get rid of hunger and cravings for good.
