# How can I prevent bad breath while fasting?

To prevent bad breath while fasting, maintain a healthy ketogenic diet with high chlorophyll content from greens. This should minimize odor issues, especially once you're fully adapted to ketosis. If bad breath persists, consider incorporating probiotics such as sauerkraut or plain kefir to support gut health.
