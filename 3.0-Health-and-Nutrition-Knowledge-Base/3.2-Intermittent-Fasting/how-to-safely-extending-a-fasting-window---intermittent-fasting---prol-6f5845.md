# How to Safely Extending a Fasting Window - Intermittent Fasting - Prolonged Fasting

To safely extend intermittent fasting into prolonged fasting, follow a gradual and well-planned approach to allow your body to adapt to more extended periods without food. Here are some guidelines for prolonging a fasting window: 

1. Extend your intermittent fast from a 20:4 fasting and feeding window to a 22:2 or an OMAD intermittent fast. Pay attention to how your body responds. If you experience fatigue, a lowering of mood, or anxiety, these could be signs that youâ€™re advancing too quickly.  Once you have safely completed OMAD, return to a 20:4 or 22:2 fasting pattern for a day or two before you attempt your following OMAD intermittent fasting pattern.  Once you have established a regular pattern of OMAD fasting, it is a good idea to have a weekly feeding day, with an extended feeding window with three meals, to ensure you build up your nutrient reserves for the following OMAD schedule. 

2. Before attempting a 36- or 48-hour fast, it's crucial to establish a consistent OMAD eating pattern and a solid nutritional foundation. Always consult your doctor, especially if you have any health concerns. During extended fasts, follow the safety guidelines listed above. 

3. A 72-hour fast or longer must be performed with a healthcare provider, as the longer the fast, the longer the recovery period between prolonged fasts.  As a general guideline, for every *day* of a prolonged fast, you should recover and rebuild your nutrient reserves for at least the same number of *weeks* before your next prolonged fast.  For example, a 3-day fast (72 hours) should be followed by three weeks of recovery before attempting another 3-day fast.  This general guideline should be followed only after consulting your healthcare provider before your next prolonged fast.

We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast.  If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**
