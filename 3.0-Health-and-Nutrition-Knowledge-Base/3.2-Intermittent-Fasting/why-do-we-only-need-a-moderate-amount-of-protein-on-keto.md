# Why do we only need a moderate amount of protein on keto?

This is because 3 oz to 6 oz of protein per meal wonâ€™t spike your insulin levels. (This amount may vary depending on your fitness level, metabolism and ability to digest protein.)

You also want to consider your fasting schedule. If you are only eating one meal a day, you may want to add a little more protein to your meal.

Consume grass-fed, grass-finished beef, pasture-raised chicken (with the skin) and eggs as well as wild-caught salmon as good protein sources. Always go for the fattier proteins as that will contribute to lower insulin levels.
