# What are some natural and effective methods to enhance the production of Human Growth Hormone (HGH)?

Sprinting is an explosive form of HIIT and has the potential to drastically increase human growth hormone.

**Sprinting can be described as a short bout of full-speed running. Sprinting puts your body under maximum stress, but only for a short amount of time. Try sprinting for about 20 to 30 seconds at a time with 90 seconds of rest in between your sprints, working up to 8 sprints.**

Sprinting can be twice as effective as injecting human growth hormone. If you also decrease your stress levels, increase your sleep quality, and do keto and intermittent fasting, you can really boost HGH naturally.

**To best stimulate human growth hormone, youâ€™ll want to do a short-duration, high-intensity workout with lots of rest. Growth hormone is stimulated by high-intensity exercise but decreases with the duration of exercise. If you have any issues like knee problems that may inhibit your ability to sprint, you can do this same type of exercise on a bicycle or while swimming.**
