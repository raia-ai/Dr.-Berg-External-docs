# Does skipping meals slow metabolism?

We have to differentiate between skipping a meal, otherwise known as infrequent meals or intermittent fasting, from just being on a low-calorie diet. They are two different things. When you decrease the frequency of your meals you’ll probably automatically reduce your calories. When you reduce your calories and the frequency of your meals you won’t feel too good. Here’s an example. I’ve done several cleanses in the past, I think it was the lemon water, cayenne pepper, and maple syrup one. I did it for ten days and it almost killed me!

The maple syrup was enough glucose to keep me out of ketosis and keep my blood sugar up and down while I was basically starving to death. I was so hungry it was torturous. I’ve done other cleanses and also felt terrible. So if someone brought up fasting, I’d reject it. But what I didn’t know then that I know now is that if you do keto (low carb) and infrequent meals and ease gradually into fasting, your hunger goes away. You adapt to burning your own fat.

**When you eat more frequently you can’t get into fat-burning mode.** **You’ll have a lot of blood sugar issues, but you won’t on keto and intermittent fasting. When you decrease meals you decrease insulin, which automatically increases your metabolic rate. You’ll feel really good because your brain loves ketones. If you do a search on how to increase your metabolism you’ll find suggestions like drink more water, eat more protein, eat spicy foods, and drink green tea. These are trivial.**

**These are the things that affect your metabolism:**

●Age, which you can’t do much about

●Dieting; go on keto and decrease the frequency of your meals

●Your diet as an infant or your mother’s diet when she was pregnant with you. If it was high carb and she developed insulin resistance you’re at higher risk of becoming prediabetic and having a slow metabolism.

●Insulin levels; decrease your meal frequency without cutting calories and see how much weight you lose

●Cortisol levels; decrease your stress

Skipping meals doesn’t slow your metabolism!
