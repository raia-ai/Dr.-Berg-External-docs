# Why Can a Fatty Liver Slow Your Thyroid - Hypothyroid?

Fatty liver disease can be caused by alcoholism, but it can also be caused by a diet rich in sugar and refined carbohydrates, with lots of frequent eating. This causes insulin spikes and can lead to insulin resistance.

These dietary choices lead to inflammation and scar tissue on the liver, eventually leading to a condition known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD).

A large abdomen or gut is one of the most common fatty liver signs, but the best way to identify a fatty liver is through ultrasound.

A fatty liver diminishes your liver function causing your cholesterol to go up, and your bile production to go down. When you don’t have enough bile, you can’t effectively remove cholesterol.

The thyroid gland produces the hormone T4, which is converted to T3 in the liver. A fatty liver causes problems with the thyroid because the liver is unable to convert T4 into T3, the active form of the thyroid hormone.

If you cannot convert enough T4 to T3, you will develop hypothyroidism. When you have a slow thyroid, you build up even more cholesterol. Hypothyroidism also slows down your metabolism and causes weight gain.

Keto and intermittent fasting address the root cause of these issues by improving the symptoms of insulin resistance. You can also increase your intake of cruciferous vegetables and all other vegetables to help reverse a fatty liver over time.

Choline is very efficient at removing fat from the liver, and can be taken as a supplement to support fatty liver disease.
