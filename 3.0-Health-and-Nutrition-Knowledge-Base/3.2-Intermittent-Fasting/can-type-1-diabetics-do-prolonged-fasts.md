# Can type 1 diabetics do prolonged fasts?

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do *not* encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provide this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast.  If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

**The focus of type-1 diabetics is to keep their glucose level under control. This is important. However, it’s also important to keep an eye on your level of insulin. The number of carbs you eat determines the amount of insulin you need. So if you consume lots of carbs, you have to use a lot of insulin. Insulin takes excess glucose and starts to store it throughout the body.**

Taking too much insulin is just as bad as having too much glucose. Fasting will help lower the amount of insulin that you need. Many type-1 diabetics have something called double diabetes.

This is a situation where your pancreas isn’t able to produce insulin (type-1), and your cells are also resistant to insulin (type-2). This means that taking insulin doesn’t always work—your insulin receptors don’t absorb the insulin you inject.

Doing fasting and healthy keto helps prevent insulin resistance.

**While you fast, it’s important to also take nutrients, including:**

• Electrolytes

• B-vitamins

• Trace minerals

• Vitamin C

• Vitamin E
