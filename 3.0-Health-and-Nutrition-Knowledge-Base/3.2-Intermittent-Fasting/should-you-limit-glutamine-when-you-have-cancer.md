# Should you limit glutamine when you have cancer?

For Individuals with Cancer, Dr. Berg mentions that cancer cells can consume glutamine, suggesting that if you have cancer, you might need to consider strategies like using a glutamine inhibitor or adjusting your diet. He suggests that intermittent fasting for extended periods and reducing protein intake could be beneficial.

While glutamine is a necessary amino acid for various bodily functions, its consumption or supplementation should be carefully considered in the context of cancer. This implies that direct supplementation with glutamine might not be recommended for cancer patients without careful consideration of their overall dietary and treatment plan.

If you have cancer, **it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider before taking glutamine supplements or making significant changes to your diet, especially regarding glutamine intake**. Dr. Berg's advice highlights the complexity of glutamine's role in the body and the need for a tailored approach to nutrition and supplementation for cancer patients.
