# Can fasting help with diabetes?

Yes, fasting is an excellent strategy to manage diabetes. During fasting periods, the body is forced to utilize stored body fats instead of sugars to generate energy. This promotes weight loss, keeps blood sugar levels balanced, and can increase insulin sensitivity, all crucial aspects for effective diabetes management.  

If you are considering fasting, we recommend that you do so under the guidance of a Healthcare professional.
