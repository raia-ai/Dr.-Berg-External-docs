# If the wheatgrass juice powder is exposed to moisture and it causes condensation when it becomes clumpy, will that affect the taste and potency?

The quality of the product will go down. It will remain some what affective for a while, but may lose it faster that if it was not affected by this. The taste will be some what the same but it will be harder to mix.
