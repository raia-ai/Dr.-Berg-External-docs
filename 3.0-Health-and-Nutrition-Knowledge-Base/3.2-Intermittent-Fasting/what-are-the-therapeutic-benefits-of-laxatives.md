# What are the therapeutic benefits of laxatives?

Laxatives are herbs and medicines that produce bowel movements and relieve constipation. People often say they don’t want to take a laxative because they may be addictive (after taking them regularly for some time, your colon muscles lose strength and can become dependent on them). But the toxic effect of having chronic constipation can be very dangerous to the body compared to the minor side effects of taking a laxative.

**Side effects**

In addition to the colon developing an addiction to laxatives, you might experience a small drop in potassium from taking a laxative, but you can easily take more potassium to replenish it. Ultimately, you want to correct what’s really causing the constipation, which usually is either the food you’re eating or a lack of friendly bacteria.

**Laxatives can have these side effects:**

- They can be addictive

They can deplete electrolytes, like potassium (in this case, you would want to add the electrolytes back)

**How to consume them**

If you have constipation, as a coping mechanism take a herbal natural laxative like cascara sagrada. This should give you constipation relief while you figure out what’s really causing the condition.

**Where to get them**

Here is a list of the best natural laxatives:

- Senna

- Cascara sagrada

- Black psyllium (swells with water)

- Castor oil

- Magnesium

- Fermented vegetables

- Probiotics

- MCT oil

- Bile salts
