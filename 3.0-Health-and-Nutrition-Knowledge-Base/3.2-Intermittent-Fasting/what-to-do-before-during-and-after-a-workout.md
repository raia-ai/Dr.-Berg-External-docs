# What to do before, during and after a workout?

It’s no surprise that there is an association between a lack of exercise and many different health concerns. One of the biggest benefits of exercise is that it increases the mitochondria. Various diseases are related to mitochondrial dysfunction, including cancer. Exercise also increases stem cells, which can turn into just about anything your body needs.

Exercise helps reduce stress, balance blood sugar levels, supports sleep, and has many other incredible health benefits.

**The four variables of exercise:**

1\. Duration

2\. Intensity

3\. Recovery

4\. Frequency

You need to give your body time to recover, not just between workouts but also during workouts. It's important to rest between four to five minutes between each set. This will allow your body to replenish ATP and help you train with maximum power. Intensity is key with exercise. Focus on higher intensity with more sets and lots of recovery. Many of the benefits of exercise also occur one to two days later during sleep.

Just a small amount of refined carbs can nullify the benefits of exercise. However, if you have diabetes or insulin resistance and are trying to build muscle on the keto diet, you can increase your carbs to 50 grams per day. The type of carbohydrates you can consume are berries and protein.

Other essential tips to increase the benefits from your workouts and support recovery:

1\. Do high-intensity interval training (HIIT)

2\. Come to a full stop vs. active recovery during HIIT workouts

3\. Put more focus on eccentric motions (elongating the muscles)

4\. Do contrasting therapy after you exercise

5\. Build up to exercising during a fasting state (eat one to two hours after a workout)

6\. Consume enough salt and electrolytes (consume electrolyte powder if needed)

7\. Consume red meat, eggs, and high-quality cheese

8\. Don’t exercise over soreness and focus on sleep instead

9\. Take copper before bed to enhance sleep
