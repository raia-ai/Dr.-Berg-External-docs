# How can I enhance and optimize my body's antioxidant defense system?

Antioxidants are crucial for neutralizing free radicals and oxidative damage, preserving DNA integrity and overall health. They can be endogenous (produced by the body) or exogenous (from food or supplements). Glutathione from sources like beef and cruciferous vegetables, and selenium from Brazil nuts and fish, are powerful examples. Maintaining a diverse antioxidant network helps mitigate oxidative stress, supported by a healthy diet, supplements, stress management, adequate sleep, exercise, and intermittent fasting.
