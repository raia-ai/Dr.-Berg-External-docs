# I have no appetite on Intermittent fasting - what do I do?

As soon as people start doing intermittent fasting, their appetite goes away, they feel better, they have less inflammation, and they have more energy. But, the thing that most people focus on is weight loss. Many think that the more weight they lose, the healthier they are. But weight loss is just one part of getting healthy.

One problem that many people have is they begin to stop doing healthy keto. This is a huge problem, especially when you're doing one meal a day. Why? Because this can cause some serious nutrient deficiencies. Some nutrient deficiencies take a long time to develop. Others happen quickly. Vitamin B12, for instance, can be stored in the body for up to a year. Other nutrients like potassium aren't stored for very long.
If you felt great when you first started intermittent fasting, but down the road, you started to feel worse and worse, this is a sign of a nutrient deficiency.
**
Signs you may have nutritional deficiencies:**

• Tiredness

• Dizziness

• Weakness

**If you start consuming just one meal a day on your intermittent fasting program, you should increase your intake of:**

• Omega 3 fatty acids (unless you consume salmon and other fatty fish every other day)

• Protein (8-10 oz. athletes may need more)

• Vitamin C/E/B9/D (eat your vegetables!)

• Minerals
