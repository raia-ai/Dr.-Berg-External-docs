# What strategies can help prevent kidney stones while practicing intermittent fasting, especially for those who are susceptible to developing them?

I would recommend using two teas on a daily basis for 2 months. One is called Chanca Piedra tea and Dandelion tea. These together can help soften stones and even prevent stones in the kidney. Drink about 16-20 ounces of tea per day.
