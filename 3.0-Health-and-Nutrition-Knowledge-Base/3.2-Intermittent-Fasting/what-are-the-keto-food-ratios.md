# What are the keto food ratios?

The percent of carbs should be 5% of the calories in your diet (low)

Your protein should be roughly 20% (moderate) and

The percent of fat should be 75% (high).

Donâ€™t count carbohydrates from vegetables in this equation since these carbs are mainly fiber and will not raise insulin too much.

Dr. Berg recommends consuming 7 to 10 cups of salad veggies (leafy greens) per day. If you are eating other vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, etc. you would need less (3.5 to 4 cups).
