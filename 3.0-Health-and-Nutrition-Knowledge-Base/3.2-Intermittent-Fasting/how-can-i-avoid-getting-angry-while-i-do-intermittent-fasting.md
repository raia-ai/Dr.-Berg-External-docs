# How can I avoid getting angry while I do intermittent fasting?

When you start intermittent fasting, your body is initially running on sugar stores. After a long enough period, your body will have used up all the glycogen and will switch over to burning fat for energy. If you eat a meal high in sugars after a period of intermittent fasting, this will cause a drastic spike in insulin, leading to irritability. To avoid this, be sure that your meals are rich in nutrients and low in carbohydrates, so that your blood sugar remains in a healthy range and you do not experience mood swings.
