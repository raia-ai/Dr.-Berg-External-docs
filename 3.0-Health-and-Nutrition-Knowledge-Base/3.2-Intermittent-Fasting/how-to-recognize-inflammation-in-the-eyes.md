## **Recognizing Inflammation and Dryness in Eyes**

This inflammation can manifest as redness, irritation, and a gritty sensation, often accompanied by excessive dryness.

[Chronic inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-10-root-causes-of-inflammation) and [dry eyes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-causes-dry-eyes) can stem from nutrient deficiencies, particularly in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, common among individuals with poorly managed blood sugar.

Addressing these deficiencies through diet and supplementation may help alleviate symptoms and support overall eye health.

## **Lifestyle Changes to Protect Your Eyesight**

In addition to dietary modifications, specific lifestyle changes can go a long way toward safeguarding eye health and managing blood sugar levels.

Implementing these strategies can help you take control of your vision and reduce the risk of severe complications down the road.

### **Diet Adjustments for Stable Blood Sugar**

Adopting a diet that promotes stable blood sugar levels is one of the most impactful changes you can make for your eye health and overall well-being.

This typically involves reducing your intake of simple carbohydrates and sugary foods while increasing your consumption of fiber-rich vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.

Focusing on nutrient-dense, low-glycemic foods can help keep your blood sugar levels in check and minimize the damaging effects of high glucose on your eyes.
