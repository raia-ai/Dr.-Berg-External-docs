# What are PFAs?

PFAS chemicals are called forever chemicals because they stay in the environment for thousands of years. They’ve been found in our fat cells and breast milk and are especially problematic in our drinking water. PFAS are linked to many health problems, including cancer, hormone problems, liver damage, and reproductive damage.

Forever chemicals are everywhere! They’re found in Teflon cookware, food packaging, and canned goods, and firefighters are exposed to them when they use their foam. PFAS were first introduced into the environment in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Companies used loopholes by conducting their own studies to classify their products as GRAS (generally recognized as safe).

To avoid the toxic side effects of PFAS, you should limit your exposure and build up your body’s tolerance to these toxic chemicals. The EWG (Environmental Working Group) evaluated 25 PFAS chemicals and found that only 3 water filters could effectively remove them from drinking water: Travel Berkey Gravity, Clearly Filtered, and Zero Water. Because the water supply exposes you to many of the forever chemicals, it’s a good idea to invest in a good water filter.

Forever chemicals build up in the body but don’t come out very easily. Here are some of the ways you can eliminate PFAS from the body and minimize their health effects:

•Sweating

•Autophagy

•Infrared light exposure

•Consuming spirulina and chlorella

Your body has detoxification enzymes that can help you eliminate poisons naturally. To help detoxify the body, consume foods with sulfur, such as eggs, garlic, and onion. Cruciferous vegetables like cabbage, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts are high in sulfur and other antioxidants that can help the detoxification process. Glutamine is a vital antioxidant that can help increase glutathione in the body. Red meat is the best source, and glycine and probiotics are also essential. It’s almost impossible to create a toxin-free environment! Trace minerals such as selenium, iodine, and copper, found in seafood and grass-fed red meat can help strengthen the biochemical pathways in your body to help eliminate forever chemicals.
