Increased thirst is a condition where you are more thirsty than normally. It usually happens with frequent urination. This can create a problem as you can lose your electrolytes fast.

**Cause #1: Diabetes / insulin resistance**

If you have insulin resistance or diabetes either can cause excessive thirst. This is because water follows blood sugar. Having these conditions you lose your water fast and the loss signals to your brain, causing you to want to drink more water.
