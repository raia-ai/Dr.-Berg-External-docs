# What are the potential causes of elevated creatinine levels in the blood?

Creatinine is a waste product of creatine in your body. Creatine is a protein compound that supports your muscle and brain metabolism. Normally, your body gets rid of creatinine through your urine. However, if it’s backing up in your blood, there could be different causes.

**Symptoms:**

- Nausea

- Chest pain

- Muscle cramps

- Vomiting

- Fatigue

- Changes in urination frequency and appearance

- High blood pressure

- Swelling or fluid retention

- Itchiness

**Cause #1: Too much protein in your diet**

If you consume too much protein in your diet, and/or consume a lot of cooked meat, this can cause high levels creatinine in the blood.

**Cause #2: Intense exercise**

Intense exercise can cause high blood creatinine as well. This is because creatinine will be produced by your muscle as a result of protein metabolism.

**Cause #3: Inflammation/injury**

An inflammatory condition, whether from an injury or not, is another reason for high creatinine in your blood. Consuming vitamin D and doing intermittent fasting should help.

**Cause #4: Consuming creatine supplement**

Many people use creatine supplements to support their workouts and energy levels. If you consume too much creatine, it can cause high creatinine levels in your blood.

**Cause #5: Kidney problems**

If you have kidney damage, this could create high creatinine levels in the blood. If that’s the case, the solution would be to support your kidneys.

**Cause #6: Gallbladder/liver problems**

The gallbladder is very important for your digestive system. If none of the above causes relate to your condition, it could come from the gallbladder.
