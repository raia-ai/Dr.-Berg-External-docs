# Should I cut out cheese to lose more weight?

Cutting out cheese, especially if it's made from pasteurized milk, can be beneficial for weight loss. However, when hitting a plateau, it's important to review a few key factors: reassess your carb intake, ensure you're fasting adequately, focus on high-quality foods, prioritize good sleep, manage stress effectively, and support healthy digestion. These elements together can help you break through weight loss plateaus.
