# Why do I have high blood glucose levels on Keto?

First, let’s quickly go over insulin resistance. **If a person is insulin resistant, they typically have very high insulin in their body—around 5 to 9x the normal amount.**

Insulin regulates blood sugars by lowering them and keeping them down. Over time, this mechanism weakens and your insulin levels drop. This leads to high blood sugar, prediabetes, and eventually diabetes.

**If you have high blood glucose on keto, you probably had high insulin before you started the keto diet. Once you begin a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, your body is no longer spiking insulin. Without high insulin, there is nothing keeping your blood sugars down.**

The good news is that high blood glucose on keto is temporary as your body transitions into ketosis. Your blood sugar will eventually stabilize.
