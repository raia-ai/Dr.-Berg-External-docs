# What are the intermittent fasting patterns for different body situations?

**1\. Growth hormone**

This is an anti-aging hormone that helps burn fat and preserve muscle. Fasting, exercise, and sleep can spike growth hormone.

• Increases at 12+ hrs.

**2\. Autophagy**

This is a condition where your body is recycling damaged proteins and clearing out microbes.

• Increases at 18+ hrs.

**3\. Inflammation**

You can really see a drop in inflammation when you do OMAD (one meal a day). This also applies to sickness and speeding up the recovery process.

• A drop in inflammation may happen at 23+ hrs.

**4\. Cancer**

With cancer, consider doing OMAD with periodic prolonged fasting. This helps lower glucose and glutamine. Also, when you do eat, consume a lot of cruciferous vegetables.

• These effects may happen after 23+ hrs.

**5\. Stem cell**

This is a cell that hasn’t turned into anything yet. When you do a periodic fast for 72 hours, you’re going to stimulate some stem cells. This can help build new tissue.

• These effects may happen after 72+ hrs.

**6\. Stubborn weight**

If you have a really stubborn weight situation, consider doing OMAD every other day. Make sure you’re getting your nutrients.

• For stubborn weight, try eating one meal every 48 hours.

**7\. Diabetes**

This is a problem with excess sugar. With diabetes, you can really help the blood sugar situation with fasting. The problem is that you must check your blood sugars routinely, and talk to your doctor about adjusting your medications. Check with your doctor and fast gradually.
