# What is hypoglycemia without symptoms?

When adopting a ketogenic diet or fasting, lower blood sugar levels, even below typical thresholds, can occur without symptoms in individuals adapted to using ketones and fats for energy. Symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as confusion, irritability, and shaking, indicate true hypoglycemia despite low readings, warranting attention. Idiopathic hypoglycemia, related to insulin receptor issues, or reactive hypoglycemia post-carb meals are also considerations. Transitioning to a low-carb ketogenic diet and integrating fasting gradually can effectively manage these conditions.
