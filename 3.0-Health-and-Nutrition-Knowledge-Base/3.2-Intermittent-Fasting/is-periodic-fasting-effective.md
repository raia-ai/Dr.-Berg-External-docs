# Is periodic fasting effective?

There are several popular periodic fasts, such as the 5:2 fast, the 3-days-a-week fast, and the every-other-day fast. However, these can make you feel miserable because they donâ€™t give your body enough time to adapt to fat burning, which takes 3-7 days. Instead of periodic fasting, consistent intermittent fasting on a daily basis is recommended to help you burn fat and improve cognition and mood.
