# Keto Fasting Tea Ingredients and Substitute Recommendations

Our Keto Fasting Tea is no longer available for purchase. While we don’t have a direct replacement, we want to empower you with information to help you find a quality tea.

Our proprietary blend included:

Rooibos, Organic Ginger, Cinnamon, Organic Stevia, Garcinia Cambogia Powder, and Red Panax Ginseng. This blend supported energy, digestion, and balance during intermittent fasting.

Here are key qualities to consider when choosing a tea:

- Search for herbs that align with your goals—whether it’s supporting metabolism, regulating appetite, improving digestion, or boosting energy, like those included in our blend.

- Choose between stimulating blends (like green or black tea) or caffeine-free options (such as ours with rooibos or herbal infusions) based on your needs.

- Prioritize clean, organic ingredients to avoid pesticide exposure.

- If you’re fasting, be mindful of added sugars or artificial sweeteners that could break a fast. Stevia or monk fruit are better options.

- Seek out transparent labels—nothing extra, just what you need.

- Tea forms:

    - Loose Leaf: Offers rich flavor and higher quality, but requires more time, tools, and cleanup.

    - Sachet: Provides convenience and decent flavor with minimal effort, but may sacrifice some freshness and complexity.
