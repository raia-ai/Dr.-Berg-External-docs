# What factors can disrupt a good night's sleep?

Sleep significantly impacts health, particularly heart function and longevity. Poor sleep correlates with disrupted blood sugar, increased cravings, higher cortisol levels, and mood disturbances.

Factors hindering good sleep include high cortisol, low levels of vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, potassium, B12, B1, and zinc. Additionally, poor sleep environments, melatonin supplementation, exposure to blue light and EMF, and stimulant consumption affect sleep quality.

Improving sleep involves cutting out sugar, adopting a low-carb diet, avoiding late or excessive eating, and focusing on relaxed breathing techniques to facilitate faster sleep onset.
