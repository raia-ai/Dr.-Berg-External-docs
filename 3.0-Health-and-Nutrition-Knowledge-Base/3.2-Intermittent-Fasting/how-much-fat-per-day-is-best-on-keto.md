# How much fat per day is best on keto?

On average, consume 20 to 40 grams of fat per meal. Multiply by how many meals you eat to get the total.

However, the best way to determine how much fat you need to consume is to base it on how you feel. If you feel satisfied with the meal and it allows you to not be hungry until the next meal, then that might be the best amount for you.
