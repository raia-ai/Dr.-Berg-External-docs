# How to avoid excessive bloating on intermittent fasting?

When reducing meal frequency, increasing portion size can lead to bloating and stress the digestive system. Strategies to overcome this include separating macro-calories, stretching out meals over two hours, and avoiding combining too many food types. Additionally, issues like low stomach acid, certain bloat-inducing vegetables, food allergies like dairy, and fat intake are important to manage, as they can affect digestion and hunger levels differently for each person.

Adjustments should be made based on your individual needs and reactions, but after the body adjusts to a fast, bloating becomes very unlikely as the digestive system will be running smoother than ever.
