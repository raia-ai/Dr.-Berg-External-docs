# What are the common causes of low back pain, and how do factors such as muscle strain, injuries, and underlying medical conditions contribute to this issue?

If you are experiencing pain in the low area of the back, this can have several causes. Most of them are connected to your kidneys. However, the pain could be due to muscle imbalances or a pinched nerve.

**Cause #1: Kidney stones / oxalates crystallization**

Oxalates are substances that are located in some foods. Oxalates can create crystallization in the kidneys, resulting in low back pain and kidney stones. The best way to resolve such a problem would be to avoid foods high in oxalates.

Additionally, consuming more water and other fluids should help with kidney stones in general. You also should take electrolytes to stay hydrated. Too acidic a body pH or consuming salts in high amounts can contribute to stone formation, specifically uric acid stones.

**Remedies:**

- As a general remedy, do an acupressure technique to relieve pain in the back:

    • watch this video
    • draw an imaginary line through your body from an epicenter of your back
    • massage the area in the front that is directly opposite from the epicenter of your back pain • the best way to know if you have hit the right spot: it will be tender

- Avoid these foods:

    • spinach
    • almonds • chocolate • rhubarb

- Consume lemon water to block oxalates

- Drink more water

- Consume electrolytes

- Consume moderate amounts of salts (reduce if needed)

- If you have too acid a pH (acidosis), alkalize the body:

    - consume more vegetables

    - take potassium citrate

**Cause #3: Too much protein**

Consuming too much protein can affect your kidneys and can result in low back pain. Additionally, if you consume a lot of protein, a large part of it will not be digested and will turn into waste products in your body. Protein should be consumed in moderate amounts daily (3 to 6 oz per meal).

**Remedies:**

- Consume moderate amounts of protein (3 to 6 oz per meal)

**Cause #4: Muscle imbalances and pinched nerves**

Muscle imbalance can cause low back pain. For example if you are developing only one set of leg muscles (like in cycling) without paying attention to additional or opposite ones, you can create additional pressure on your muscles and as result on your back. Another example would be sitting and crossing your legs only on one side and not doing the same with the other leg to balance it out; this can result in a pinched nerve on one side.

**Remedies:**

- If you find yourself repeatedly crossing your legs from one side, alternate and cross from the other side

- If you are cycling, work out your glutes and the back side of your legs to balance the muscles out

- You can also do yoga to strengthen your weak muscles

- As a general remedy, do an acupressure technique to relieve pain in the back:

    - watch this video

    - draw an imaginary line through your body from an epicenter of your back

    - massage the area in the front that is directly opposite from the epicenter of your back pain

    - the best way to know if you hit the right spot: it will be tender

**Other causes:**

- Acidosis
