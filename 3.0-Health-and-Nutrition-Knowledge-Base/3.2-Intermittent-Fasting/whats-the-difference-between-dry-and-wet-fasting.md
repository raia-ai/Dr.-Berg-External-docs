# What's the difference between dry and wet fasting?

**What is dry fasting?** Dry fasting is fasting (not eating) without any water or liquids of any kind.

**What is water fasting?** Water fasting is when you’re fasting, but you’re drinking water.

**There are also two types of dry fasting:**

**Soft dry fasting:** This is when you’re allowed to use water when you brush your teeth or take a shower.

**Hard dry fasting:** This is when you do not expose any part of your body to water at all.

The body can typically only go around three days without water. But, your body will go a lot longer if you’re just restricting food and not water because you still have a fat reserve to live off of.

There is no research or studies comparing dry fasting and wet fasting side by side. But, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s a bad thing or that you won’t get amazing results. In theory, dry fasting may work well for some people for one day. If you wanted to try dry fasting, I wouldn’t go longer than one day. Then, you can compare a day of doing a dry fast and a day of doing a wet fast and see what works best for you.
