# How can I assess the safety of beauty and skincare products for my needs, considering ingredients and potential allergens?

The skin is a human sponge that directly absorbs everything you put on it. An average female absorbs 4 pounds and 6 ounces of chemicals every single year or puts 515 synthetic chemicals on the skin every day. Some of these chemicals are carcinogens which are things that can cause certain types of disease.

Chemicals in Makeup:

• Carcinogens

• Neurotoxins – These go into the brain and the nervous system

• Endocrine Disruptors – Chemicals in the environment that mimic estrogen, which affect the different endocrine glands (thyroid, pancreas, adrenal gland, ovary)

**Ways to Get Chemicals Out of the Body:**

• Evaluate what your body is being exposed to – replace toxins with more natural and less toxic.

• Detox using cruciferous vegetables to help the liver break down these poisons – These are very unique vegetables that help to naturally detoxify without harmful effects.

• Do intermittent fasting – It is a physiological vacation from constantly eating all the time and gives the organs time to rest, heal and repair. It also triggers autophagy, where the body is recycling all the things that it doesn’t need and then builds new tissue.

• Make sure to eat enough healthy fats – fish (wild-caught salmon), coconut oil, seafood, nuts, seeds, olive oil, avocado

**Cruciferous Vegetables:**

• Kale

• Broccoli

• Cabbage

• Brussels sprouts

• Bok choy

• Arugula

• Collard Greens

• Radish

• Watercress
