# How can I efficiently speed up muscle growth?

High-intensity exercise and protein consumption build muscle. Aim to consume .8 to 1.5 grams of high-quality protein per kilogram of lean body mass. Athletes may need to consume up to 2 grams of protein per kilogram.

1\. Creatine

Creatine is found in foods, but if you want to grow your muscles quickly, take creatine as a supplement. Creatine acts as a substitute for energy, especially for short-duration high-intensity exercise. Try taking 20 grams of creatine for five days, then a maintenance dosage of 3 grams daily for the rest of the month, and then continue this cycle between the large and small amounts.

2\. Cold therapy

Cold showers, cold immersion, and cryotherapy require your body to generate a tremendous amount of energy to maintain its core temperature. To do this, your body generates a type of fat known as brown fat, which stimulates white fat. This burns a lot of calories! Cold therapy increases the expression of muscle genes in both rats and humans. It increases RNA, which makes the proteins you need to build muscle. Cold therapy also decreases inflammation.

3\. Intermittent fasting

Intermittent fasting stimulates growth hormone, which increases muscle growth. Aim for two meals daily without decreasing your caloric intakeâ€”and cut the snacks! Intermittent fasting helps improve insulin resistance, which gets more insulin to the muscle.

4\. Arginine Arginine also increases growth hormone by inhibiting a hormone called somatostatin. Arginine has even been used to increase growth in children. Try taking 3 to 6 grams daily on an empty stomach 30 minutes before you work out.
