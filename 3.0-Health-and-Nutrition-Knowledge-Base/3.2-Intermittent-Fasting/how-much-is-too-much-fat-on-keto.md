# How much is too much fat on Keto?

This is a balance of enough versus too much and getting your sweet spot (no pun intended).

If you have hypoglycemia (low blood sugars) you will need a bit more to go from one meal to the next. However, you also need to make sure you do not have too much, thus overloading the gallbladder and causing (bloating, right shoulder pain, etc). Also, if you consume too much fat, esp. between meals or after meals, you will end up burning dietary fat and NOT your own fat despite being in ketosis.

This is why I recommend always doing intermittent fasting with ketosis. So in other words - you'll have to adjust your fats until it's just right - no gallbladder issues, but allowing you to go from one meal to the next. If you are new to this, you may want to get my booklet or even my bigger book either on the website - drberg.com or amazon. On my website - you can get both as a discount, but not on amazon.
