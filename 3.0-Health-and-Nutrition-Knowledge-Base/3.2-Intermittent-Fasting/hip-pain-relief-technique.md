Reference this video for a full demonstration of a unique technique to get hip pain relief fast! A few important points to keep in mind:

• Do not press on the side that hurts. Work on the opposite side from where you’re feeling pain.

• The way you know you’ve found the right spot is if it feels tender or sore. Apply light pressure and massage.

If this technique doesn’t work for you, you may be experiencing referred pain. For example, if you’re a female, a cyst on the ovary can cause hip pain. In this case, sea kelp may be a fantastic natural option to try.
