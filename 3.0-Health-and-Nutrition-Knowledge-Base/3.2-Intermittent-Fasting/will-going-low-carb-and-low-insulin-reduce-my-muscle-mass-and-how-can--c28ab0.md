# Will going low-carb and low-insulin reduce my muscle mass, and how can I maintain muscle while doing keto and intermittent fasting?

Maintaining muscle mass on a low-carb, low-insulin diet is possible if you follow these guidelines:

\- Keep your daily carb intake between 50-60 grams.

\- Consume 8-9 ounces of protein per meal.

\- Ensure you're not deficient in essential nutrients.

Insulin is an anabolic hormone that helps absorb amino acids, but consistently high insulin from carbs and sugar leads to insulin resistance, impairing amino acid absorption and causing muscle loss. Keto and intermittent fasting improve insulin sensitivity, enhancing amino acid and protein absorption.

For muscle maintenance and growth, incorporate weight training and increase protein intake. Aim for 8-9 ounces of high-quality protein per meal from sources like eggs, meat, and fish. Avoid high-carb foods to prevent insulin resistance.

Consider supplementing with complete amino acids for maximum efficiency in muscle building.
