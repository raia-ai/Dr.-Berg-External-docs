# Is hypoglycemia the opposite of diabetes?

Diabetes is hyperglycemia, hyper meaning “high” and hypo meaning “low”.

Hypoglycemia is not the opposite of hyperglycemia - it is the precursor or the thing that will turn into diabetes sooner or later. The difference between the two is that hypoglycemia is the prediabetic state while in hyperglycemia there is already an insulin resistance.

What to Do for Hypoglycemia:

• Intermittent Fasting

• Reduce Carbs
