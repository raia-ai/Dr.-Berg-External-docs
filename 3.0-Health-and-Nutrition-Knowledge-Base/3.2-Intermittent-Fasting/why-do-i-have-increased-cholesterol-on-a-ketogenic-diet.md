# Why do I have increased cholesterol on a Ketogenic diet?

A fat cell is composed of triglycerides and cholesterol. You are losing weight, you are losing fat, and as you do that the fat cell breaks down. You can burn the triglycerides part of the fat for fuel, but not cholesterol. Cholesterol will be eliminated. So this spike in cholesterol is temporary and will go down.

If you are concerned about your cholesterol or LDL, you may want to request an advanced lipid panel which measures the particle size.

Continue to consume large amounts of veggies to help flush your liver and other organs while youâ€™re on a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. Bile salts are also extremely helpful. Bile salts help to regulate excessive amounts of cholesterol so a lack of bile salts can keep your cholesterol high.
