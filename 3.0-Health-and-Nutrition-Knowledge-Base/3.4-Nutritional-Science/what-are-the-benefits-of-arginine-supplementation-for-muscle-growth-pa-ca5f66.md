# What are the benefits of arginine supplementation for muscle growth, particularly regarding muscle protein synthesis and performance?

Introducing another powerful player in the muscle-building game – [Arginine](https://www.drberg.com/blog/10-benefits-of-l-arginine). This amino acid works its magic by boosting growth hormone production, a key factor in muscle repair and development.

It acts like taking the brakes off growth hormone, allowing it to surge through your system and exert its muscle-building effects.

Studies, even in children, have demonstrated the growth-promoting effects of Arginine. Some findings suggest that supplementing with arginine can help increase height.

This growth hormone boost isn't just limited to height; it can translate to increased muscle growth and strength as well.

Incorporating a higher amount of arginine, around 3 to 6 grams daily on an empty stomach, especially 30 minutes before your workout, could provide that extra edge you’ve been searching for.

Arginine is naturally found in foods like red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products, so ensuring you're getting enough of these protein sources can contribute to your daily arginine intake.
