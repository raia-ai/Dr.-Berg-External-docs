# What are the side effects of ingredients in the soda on my health?

Soda ingredients like high-fructose corn syrup, phosphoric acid, and caffeine can harm bone health:

1\. High-fructose corn syrup:

\- Depletes vitamin D and calcium.

\- Increases calcium loss through kidneys.

\- Depletes magnesium needed for bone strength and vitamin D absorption.

2\. Phosphoric acid:

\- Raises osteoporosis risk.

\- Weakens tooth enamel.

\- Reduces iron and zinc absorption.

3\. Caffeine:

\- Causes calcium leaching from bones.

Reducing soda intake helps protect bone health from these effects.
