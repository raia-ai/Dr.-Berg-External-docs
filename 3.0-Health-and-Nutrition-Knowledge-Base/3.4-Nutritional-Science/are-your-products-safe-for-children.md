# Are your products safe for children?

The Kids Chewable Multivitamin and Friendly Bacteria Probiotic are safe for children under 18 years old as long as they consume the recommended usage.

However, all other Dr. Berg Nutritionals products contain doses that are designed for and studied with adults who are 18 years or older. If a minor wishes to use any of our products, they must first consult a medical professional before use.
