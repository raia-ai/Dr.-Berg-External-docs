# What are the effective interventions and management strategies for treating constipation in a six-year-old?

For a six-year-old with constipation, consider addressing dietary factors first. Ensure adequate potassium intake and include foods that support digestion, such as fermented foods and probiotics. Eliminate refined grains and sugars from the diet. If necessary, use a gentle herbal laxative like Smooth Move Tea to aid in bowel movements. Consult with a healthcare provider before making significant changes or using supplements.
