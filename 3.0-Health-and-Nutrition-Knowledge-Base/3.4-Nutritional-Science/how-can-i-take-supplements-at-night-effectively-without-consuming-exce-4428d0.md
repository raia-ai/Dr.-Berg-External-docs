# How can I take supplements at night effectively without consuming excessive amounts of water?

To take supplements at night without consuming excessive water, consider breaking them into smaller doses and taking them with a minimal amount of a non-stimulatory food. Options include small amounts of celery, vegetables, or MCT oil. Fiber and fat are preferable choices as they have minimal impact on insulin levels compared to carbohydrates and proteins.
