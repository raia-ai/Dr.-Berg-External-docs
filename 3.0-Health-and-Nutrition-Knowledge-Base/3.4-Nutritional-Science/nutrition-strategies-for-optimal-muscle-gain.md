# Nutrition Strategies for Optimal Muscle Gain

Macronutrient Balance: Achieving muscle growth requires a careful balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Aim for approximately 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight to support muscle repair and growth. Include healthy fats—like those from avocados, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish—targeting around 0.5 grams per pound of body weight for hormone production and overall health.

Keto, Fasting, and Exercise: Combining ketogenic principles and intermittent fasting with strategic exercise routines enhances muscle development. Brined chicken thighs are a valuable addition, offering lean protein that supports muscle growth and aligns with both keto and fasting protocols.
