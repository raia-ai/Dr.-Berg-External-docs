# Why do people fail with intermittent fasting?

There are a few reasons someone might fail at intermittent fasting. The first is that they never even start, because they are afraid of starvation and extreme discomfort as they do not understand how well the body adapts to fasting. Some are too used to eating multiple times a day and cannot find the motivation to cut down their eating window.

Others start the intermittent fasting diet but quit after the first few days because they feel worse. This is because they do not understand it takes some time to adjust. These early transitional symptoms can be alleviated by taking potassium, sodium, and B1. The final reason people quit is because they are not losing weight. In this instance, it is important to focus on the many other positive benefits fasting has provided you, like improved energy, decreased cravings, less hunger, and increased mental clarity.
