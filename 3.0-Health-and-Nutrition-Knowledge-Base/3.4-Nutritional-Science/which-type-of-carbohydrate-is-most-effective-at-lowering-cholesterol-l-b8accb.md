# Which type of carbohydrate is most effective at lowering cholesterol levels, and how does it contribute to improved cardiovascular health?

In some cases, it’s not a problem if cholesterol is a little bit higher. This can happen when you first start the keto diet because you’re mobilizing cholesterol from the fat cells. But what can you do if you need to lower bad cholesterol naturally? There is one specific food that can really help you.

Your body makes cholesterol. Excess cholesterol is eliminated through the bile ducts with the help of bile salts. Bile salts have a lot of important roles in the body.

Typically, carbohydrates will increase cholesterol and triglycerides. There are three types of carbohydrates: sugar, starches, and fiber. Fiber can actually help reduce your cholesterol, but it has to be the right type of fiber. We’re talking about the fiber in vegetables.

Vegetables have low amounts of sugar and high amounts of fiber. They’re also rich in nutrients, phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals.

Fiber helps bind with cholesterol and modify the absorption of lipids and fats. It also increases the production of bile and eliminates bile connected to cholesterol.Fiber has zero effect on blood sugar and insulin, which will help lower your cholesterol. Feeding your microbes fiber also decreases the production of cholesterol.

If you have high cholesterol, consume more vegetables to help increase the release of bile and feed the microbes. At the same time, be sure to avoid sugar and starch in your diet.
