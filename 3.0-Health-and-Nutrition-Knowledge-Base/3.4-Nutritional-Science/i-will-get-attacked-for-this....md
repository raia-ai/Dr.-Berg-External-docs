**The Medical Industry: Lies and Misconceptions**

Modern medicine is often heavily influenced by big pharma and big food, leading to a focus on medication and overlooking the crucial role of nutrition. Let's expose some common medical industry lies:

1. **"You donâ€™t need a gallbladder"** - False. Your gallbladder stores bile, essential for fat digestion. Removing it can lead to digestive issues.

2. **"Statins have minimal side effects"** - False. Statins can cause serious side effects like type 2 diabetes and liver damage.

3. **"Hypertension is caused by too much salt"** - Misleading. While reducing sodium can help, focus on increasing potassium intake for healthy blood pressure.

4. **"Low amounts of vitamin D will fix a deficiency"** - False. If deficient, you'll need much more than 600-800 IU daily, likely around 10,000 IU.

5. **"Red meat causes cancer"** - False. Grass-fed red meat is a nutrient-dense, healthy food, rich in protein, B vitamins, and essential minerals.

6. **"Avoid saturated fats"** - Misleading. The real danger lies in unhealthy unsaturated fats found in seed oils and processed foods.

7. **"Your weight is causing your health issues"** - False. Weight is often a *symptom* of underlying issues like insulin resistance.

8. **"Plant-based diets are best"** - Misleading. Many plant-based products are ultra-processed and less healthy than whole foods.

9. **"Hypoglycemia is a complication of diabetes"** - False. Hypoglycemia indicates too much insulin, but doctors often advise treating it with more sugar.

**Remember:** It's important to be informed and question conventional medical advice. Focus on a balanced, whole-food diet and prioritize your overall health.
