# Can hypothyroidism develop into Hashimoto's thyroiditis?

While hypothyroidism doesn't always lead to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, it's important to note that in about 90% of cases, hypothyroidism is indeed linked to this autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid. Therefore, addressing the underlying autoimmune issue is essential.

In this context, I recommend focusing on selenium intake, as it is generally more beneficial than iodine, although a moderate amount of iodine can still be helpful. I've created a detailed video on this topic for further guidance.

Additionally, many cases of thyroid dysfunction can originate in the gut, highlighting the significant connection between gluten, grains, and autoimmune responses. It is crucial to avoid these foods to help manage symptoms effectively.
