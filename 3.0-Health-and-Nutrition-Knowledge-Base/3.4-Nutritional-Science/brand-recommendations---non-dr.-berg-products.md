# Brand Recommendations - Non Dr. Berg Products

Dr. Berg does not endorse specific product brands because supplement formulations can change unexpectedly, making it difficult to provide accurate recommendations. However, Dr. Berg suggests choosing a high-quality supplement from a company that:

\- Conducts third-party testing to confirm the product's contents, including microbial testing and reporting on heavy metals.

\- Operates a GMP-certified manufacturing facility.

\- Uses non-GMO ingredients and, if possible, organic ingredients.

\- Maintains high customer feedback ratings, not only for the specific product you are interested in, but also across all of their products.

While we do not carry this product, please let me know if I can complete our Product Request form and provide any specific feedback you want to include for Dr. Berg. I am happy to complete this request for you!
