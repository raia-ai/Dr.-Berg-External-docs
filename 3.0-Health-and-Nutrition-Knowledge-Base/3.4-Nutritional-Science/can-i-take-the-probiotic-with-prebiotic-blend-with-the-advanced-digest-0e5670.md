# Can I take the Probiotic with Prebiotic Blend with the Advanced Digestive Enzymes?

Yes, you can take the Probiotic with the Prebiotic Blend along with digestive enzymes. Combining a digestive enzyme supplement with probiotics can significantly enhance their health benefits. Digestive enzymes help break down food into smaller particles, releasing prebiotic fibers that probiotic microbes can ferment to generate energy and nutrients. This synergy supports overall digestive health and nutrient absorption.

While the two supplements can be taken together, it is best to take them at different times of the day. Advanced Digestive Enzymes are best taken a few minutes before a meal to help raise the acidity in the stomach. However, Probiotic with Prebiotic Blend is best in the morning, during a meal, or after meals when stomach acidity is lower. This timing helps ensure that the probiotics survive the acidic conditions of the stomach and reach the intestines, where they can be most effective.
