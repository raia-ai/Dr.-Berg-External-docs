# What are some counterintuitive health tips that, despite seeming unusual, have proven to be highly effective for improving health?

**Hormesis describes two things that might oppose each other. In terms of health, hormesis refers to a controlled dose of stress that makes positive changes for your body.**

With hormesis, you can adapt to various types of stress, including exercise, radiation, cold, heat, hypoxia, plant chemicals, pesticides, insecticides, and fungicides. Sulforaphane found in broccoli sprouts and radish sprouts triggers the heat shock protein that allows the body to strengthen its detoxification enzymes. In this instance, the body is exposed to a small amount of poison that strengthens its ability to get rid of other poisons.

**The liver** contains phase 1 and phase 2 detoxification enzymes that can take a poison and turn it into a harmless particle. Sulforaphane triggers this system.

**Exercise** is one of the best examples of hormesis. Exercise induces microinflammation but then allows the body to get rid of inflammation.

**Fasting** activates the body’s mechanisms that counter starvation. It encourages our brain cells to grow, increases mitochondria, and regenerates the immune system.

**Health is often counterintuitive.** For example, cutting fat won’t help you lose fat, and sterilizing your environment won’t protect you from getting sick.

You can’t develop a strong immune system without getting sick. Antibiotics destroy good bacteria in the body, which can lead to pathogen overgrowth. Antacids can lead to more heartburn because you need more acid to get rid of heartburn.

When you don't expose yourself to the sun, you put yourself more at risk for certain types of cancers. Many people have been told that the sun causes cancer, but the sun gives us vitamin D. Having a deficiency in vitamin D can increase your risk for cancer.

**One last example is dieting.** The more dieting you do in your lifetime, the more weight you will gain—especially if you’re doing it incorrectly.
