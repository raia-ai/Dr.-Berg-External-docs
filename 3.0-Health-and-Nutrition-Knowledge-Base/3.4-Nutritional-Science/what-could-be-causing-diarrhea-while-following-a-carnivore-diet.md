# What could be causing diarrhea while following a carnivore diet?

While following a carnivore diet can be beneficial for some, persistent diarrhea may indicate that your gut microbiota is not being adequately supported. Microbes primarily thrive on fiber from vegetables, which serves as their main fuel source and acts as a prebiotic. While animal products can provide some nutrients, they do not fulfill the prebiotic role.

If you are on a carnivore diet due to existing gut issues, it’s crucial to ensure you’re approaching it correctly. Simply consuming meat may not be sufficient. Incorporating a variety of animal products, such as eggs, fish, organ meats, and shellfish, can provide a broader range of nutrients and support gut health more effectively.
