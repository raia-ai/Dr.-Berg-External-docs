# What are the potential reasons for waking up feeling exhausted?

Waking up exhausted in the morning can cause you to be less efficient during the day. There are several causes that could be behind this problem. True remedies should improve your sleep quality, making you feel more energetic when you wake up.

**Cause 1: Lights before going to bed**

Being exposed to light will reduce the production of melatonin (sleep hormone). If you have lights on around you before going to bed this effect can keep you awake.

**Cause 2: Chronic stress**

When you are undergoing constant stress it can cause difficulty sleeping, including not being able to rest fully at night. This is because your stress-regulating glands (adrenals) are worn out.

**Cause 3: Electromagnetic fields**

Electronic devices generate electronic waves around them if the device is plugged in, even if it is turned off. If you sit in front of the computer all day this can badly affect your sleep at night. The electronic waves decrease the production of melatonin (a sleep hormone) in your body.

**Cause 4: Caffeine**

Caffeine is a stimulant which can keep you up at night and cause you to have poor sleep. It takes time for the liver to detoxify such stimulants. Too much caffeine from coffee and tea will prevent your body from fully relaxing.

**Cause 5: Nutritional deficiency**

Not having enough nutrients can cause inefficient rest during sleep hours. There are several nutrients that are needed for good rest at night while sleeping. These nutrients have to do with keeping your nervous system and sleep hormones working properly to result in good sleep.

**Cause 6: Altered pH (too-acid or too-alkaline body)**

Your body may be too alkaline or too acidic. Let’s look at the symptoms of being too alkaline (alkalosis) or being too acidic (acidosis) because both of them can potentially cause sleep problems.

Alkalosis: If you’re too alkaline, your muscles are going to be tense and tight, which can cause cramping at night and in general.
