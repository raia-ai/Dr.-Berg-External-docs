# What's better to consume on Keto, berries or fruits?

Fruits are generally higher in sugar and lower in fiber than vegetables. However, berries offer a unique advantage: they have less sugar and a lower glycemic load. This means they're packed with fiber and phytonutrients that help manage blood sugar spikes.

Here's a quick comparison:

- **Blackberries (他 cup):** 4g carbs (best choice!)

- **Raspberries (他 cup):** Slightly higher in carbs

- **Strawberries (他 cup):** Higher in carbs than blackberries and raspberries

- **Blueberries (他 cup):** 12g carbs (still a decent option)

Compare this to other fruits:

- **Apple:** 25g carbs, 19g sugar

- **Peach:** 13g sugar, 12g carbs

- **Banana:** 27g carbs, 14g sugar

- **Grapes:** 16g carbs, 15g sugar

Clearly, berries are a much better choice for a ketogenic diet. Remember, the goal with keto is to keep carbs low while minimizing blood sugar spikes, also known as the glycemic index and glycemic load.
