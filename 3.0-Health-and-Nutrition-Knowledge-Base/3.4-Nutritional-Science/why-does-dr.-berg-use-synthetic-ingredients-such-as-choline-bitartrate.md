# Why does Dr. Berg use synthetic ingredients such as choline bitartrate?

**Why Are Synthetic Ingredients Used in Dr. Berg’s Products?**

In the world of supplements, natural isn’t always better, and synthetic doesn’t mean unsafe or inferior. Synthetic ingredients are often chosen because they’re the only way to deliver precise, powerful, and proven results. Here’s why certain synthetic ingredients are used in Dr. Berg’s formulas:

**Choline Bitartrate**

High Concentration: Natural choline from food is valuable—but often not concentrated enough to meet specific needs like liver health or methylation support. Choline bitartrate provides a focused, supplemental dose.

Standardized and Stable: This form delivers choline in a clean, consistent, and predictable way—every time. No variability, just reliable results.

Effective Nutritional Support: Its stability and potency make it ideal for targeted strategies where dietary intake alone may fall short.

Bottom Line: This carefully crafted form of choline offers dependable, concentrated support that complements your nutrition and delivers on specific health goals.
