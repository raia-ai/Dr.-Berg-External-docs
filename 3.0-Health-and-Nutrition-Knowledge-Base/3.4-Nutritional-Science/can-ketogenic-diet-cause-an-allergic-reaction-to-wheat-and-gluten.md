# Can Ketogenic diet cause an allergic reaction to wheat and gluten?

No, it's not going to create an allergy. You're going to be aware of the allergy more because as you clean up your diet some of these other things are going to show up more before it might've you just been numb to it. The other thing too is with the wheat and stuff is that it actually has a morphine effect so it can numb you. And so now you clean up your diet and then you go back to it and you might notice it more because you don't have all these other factors triggering it.
