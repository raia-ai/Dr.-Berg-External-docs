# What is the most crucial detoxifying agent and antioxidant for liver health?

To promote liver health and support recovery from damage caused by a high-carb diet, glutathione plays a crucial role:

\- Glutathione, a potent antioxidant, protects and repairs the liver, preventing conditions like fatty liver and reducing oxidative stress.

\- It detoxifies the liver, counters insulin resistance, and supports mitochondrial health.

\- Factors depleting glutathione include alcohol, stress, toxins, and poor diet.

\- Boost glutathione levels with foods like beef, fish, cruciferous vegetables, garlic, and onions, as well as supplements like NAC, curcumin, melatonin, vitamin D3, SAMe, and alpha-lipoic acid.
