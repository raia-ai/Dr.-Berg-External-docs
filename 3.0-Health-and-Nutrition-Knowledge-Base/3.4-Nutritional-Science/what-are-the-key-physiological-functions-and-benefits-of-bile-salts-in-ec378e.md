# What are the key physiological functions and benefits of bile salts in digestion and nutrient absorption?

The gallbladder is very important. It helps you store and concentrate bile salts. Your liver and friendly bacteria also make bile. About 95-97% of all the bile the body makes is actually recycled.

Typically, when people take bile salts as a supplement, they take them with a meal or just after they eat. Bile salts can help with bloating, belching, burping, and nausea. The primary function of bile salts that most people know of is the extraction of fat-soluble vitamins from the fat in your diet. However, there are many other benefits of purified bile salts. There are also benefits of taking them on an empty stomach.
