\- Vitamin D3: Supports immune function and reduces inflammation.

\- Intermittent Fasting: Promotes cellular repair and reduces inflammation markers.

\- Vegetables and Salads: Cruciferous vegetables for anti-inflammatory benefits.

\- Keto and Carnivore Diets: Reduce carb-induced inflammation.

\- TUDCA: Supports liver function and bile flow.

\- Tocotrienols: Anti-inflammatory properties, support cardiovascular health.

\- Cold Therapy: Reduces inflammation and promotes recovery.

\- Exercise: Improves circulation and reduces chronic inflammation.

\- Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Found in cod liver oil, sardines, and salmon, known for anti-inflammatory effects.
