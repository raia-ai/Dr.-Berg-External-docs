# Should I be worried about the citric acid in the Electrolyte Powder?

There is no need to be concerned about the natural citric acid in our Electrolyte Powder products.

Not all citric acid is the same or creates the same effect. The adverse effects of citric acid depend on the source. The citric acid in the Electrolyte Powder is from the root vegetable cassava or tapioca. This source of citric acid is in a very low concentration. If we compare this to the artificially manufactured citric acid in junk foods - which is massive, there is a big difference in the adverse effects on the body.

Citric acid is vital to our health and is also made by our body. If you look at the Krebs cycle in the mitochondria, the first molecule that feeds the whole machine is citric acid.
