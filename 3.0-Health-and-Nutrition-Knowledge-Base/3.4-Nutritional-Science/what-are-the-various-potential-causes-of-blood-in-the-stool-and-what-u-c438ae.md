# What are the various potential causes of blood in the stool, and what underlying conditions might this symptom indicate?

If you have a red-colored stool this can simply come from consuming too many beets, which make it appear as if you have blood leaking. However it can also stem from hemorrhoids.

**Cause #1: Hemorrhoids**

Hemorrhoid is a dilated, inflamed vein on the bottom part of your rectum or inside it that is painful and can cause bleeding. Consuming collinsonia root as well as natural vitamin C complex would help with this condition.

**Cause #2: Consuming beets**

If you consume a lot of beets they can give the appearance that the stool is bloody. This is only due to the beetâ€™s red color.
