# What is an MCT powder in the Trace Minerals?

**Medium Chain Triglyceride Oil Powder** 

- **Enhanced Absorption:** MCTs are known to improve the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and minerals. Trace minerals like zinc, selenium, and chromium are better absorbed in the presence of fats. MCT oil provides a healthy fat source that helps carry these essential minerals into the bloodstream.  

- **Improved Bioavailability:** MCTs are metabolized differently than other fats. They are quickly broken down and absorbed by the liver, where they can be converted into energy or used to transport nutrients throughout the body. This rapid metabolism can help increase the bioavailability of trace minerals, making them more readily available for the body to use.  

- **Stability and Shelf Life:** MCT oil is a stable carrier oil that helps preserve the quality and potency of trace minerals in supplements. It prevents them from oxidizing or degrading, helping the nutrients remain effective for a longer period.
