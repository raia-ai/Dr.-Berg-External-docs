# What are the reasons for high creatine on Keto?

First, what is creatinine? It’s a waste product from muscle metabolism. (Side note: a waste product from dietary protein is called urea.) Every day your body converts creatine to creatinine.

**The higher level of creatinine on keto isn’t pathological. Here are the five reasons why they are high:**

1\. Consuming way too much protein, especially cooked meat. Ideally, you want to eat three to six ounces of protein, or as much as seven, at a meal. If you’re a big person perhaps a little more.

2\. Taking too much creatine supplementation; try cutting back

3\. Exercising excessively especially if it’s intense, because of muscle physiology. Cut back and take longer to recover.

4\. Having an injury or inflammatory condition, which could itself be pathological

5\. Having a problem with your gallbladder or liver, which could also be pathological
