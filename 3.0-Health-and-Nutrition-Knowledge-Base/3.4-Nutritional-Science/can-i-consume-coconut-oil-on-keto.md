# Can I consume coconut oil on keto?

Some people are a little nervous about consuming coconut oil, based on false information. By the way, it’s not bad for your heart, nor is it a poison. It’s been used for hundreds of years by many cultures without problems. In fact, there are some cultures whose diet is 60 percent coconut-based, who are quite healthy. Coconut oil will boost HDL, the so-called good cholesterol.

The coconut is the largest seed on earth. It takes 3 years to break the soil it is in, so that the seed can actually grow.

The three significant benefits of coconut oil are:

- Supports your brain. A significant part of coconut oil is what’s called MCTs, or medium chain triglycerides – a type of fat that turns into ketones. Your brain cells love ketones. Ketones protect the nerves and brain cells against stress. They’ve been shown to boost cognitive function and to help people with dementia as well as Alzheimer’s.

- It’s antibacterial and antimicrobial. Its 3 main fatty acids are caprylic, capril and lauric, and they’re responsible for these properties, along with being antifungal, anti-candida, anti- yeast and antiviral. Monolaural, the precursor to lauric acid, has the capacity to dismantle the fatty layer around certain viruses. So it’s beneficial for your immune system.

- Provides you with more energy, because MCT oil doesn’t require digestive enzymes. It gets absorbed directly into your body. You get fatty acids and ketones for fuel, which are much more efficient than glucose. You’ll get more of what’s called ATP, the body’s energy currency, than you do from carbs.
