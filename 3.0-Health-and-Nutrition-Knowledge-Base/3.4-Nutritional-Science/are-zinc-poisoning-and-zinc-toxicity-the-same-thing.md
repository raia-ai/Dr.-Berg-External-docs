# Are zinc poisoning and zinc toxicity the same thing?

Zinc poisoning typically results from a single large dose of zinc, leading to acute symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps.

Zinc toxicity is characterized by the development of health issues caused by chronic zinc exposure linked to symptoms such as anemia, copper deficiency, and neurological problems.
