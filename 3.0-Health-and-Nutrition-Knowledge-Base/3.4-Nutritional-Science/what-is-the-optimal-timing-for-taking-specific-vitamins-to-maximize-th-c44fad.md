# What is the optimal timing for taking specific vitamins to maximize their effectiveness and absorption, and how does timing impact their benefits?

**Optimizing Supplement Timing**

**Morning Supplements**

For energy and metabolism, take B-complex vitamins, especially B12, in the morning with breakfast. Research shows B vitamins can reduce fatigue and improve cognitive performance.

**Evening Supplements**

For relaxation and better sleep, consider magnesium before bedtime. Studies indicate magnesium can enhance sleep quality, particularly in those with sleep disturbances.

**Supplement Intake Considerations**

\- **With Food vs. Empty Stomach:** Iron is best absorbed on an empty stomach, while calcium should be taken with food to increase absorption. A 2015 study showed a 22% increase in calcium absorption when taken with a meal.

\- **Health Conditions:** Adjust supplement timing based on health conditions and medications. For instance, thyroid medication should be taken on an empty stomach, with a wait of 30 minutes before consuming other supplements or food. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
