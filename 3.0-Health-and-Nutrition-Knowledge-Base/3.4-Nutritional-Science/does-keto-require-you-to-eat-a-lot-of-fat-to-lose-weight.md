# Does keto require you to eat a lot of fat to lose weight?

You would consume more fat than usual on the ketogenic diet, compared to the standard American diet.

On average, you would have to get about 70% of your calories from fat. Healthy fats allow you to remain satisfied until your next meal and will support your body with needed fat-soluble vitamins.

On average, consume 20 to 40 g of fat every meal. This will supply you with needed nutrients and calories so itâ€™s easier to keep winning with the keto regime.
