# Can a ketogenic diet provide benefits for individuals with Alzheimer's disease?

**Alzheimer’s and ketosis:**

As well as the rest of the human body, our brain runs on fuel. Alzheimer’s disease (whether caused by genetics or brain damage) makes the brain unable to efficiently utilize sugar/carb fuel (glucose), resulting in brain starvation. However, our brains love ketones (fat-burning fuel) more than sugar/carb fuel anyway. Although the damaged brain parts of Alzheimer’s disease patients can’t utilize glucose efficiently, they can successfully utilize ketones.
