# Which vitamins and minerals should I consider after undergoing chemotherapy?

It's important to recognize that the dietary strategies for cancer prevention differ significantly from those for managing an existing cancer diagnosis. This distinction can serve as motivation to explore appropriate dietary approaches.

Cancer cells originate from normal cells that have become damaged, leading them to revert to an ancient metabolic pathway that allows them to ferment fuel and evade programmed cell death. This adaptation enables cancer cells to survive indefinitely, employing various mechanisms for their persistence.

Understanding these underlying mechanisms is crucial. Unfortunately, there is considerable confusion regarding the best approaches to take, particularly within conventional medical frameworks, where prognosis may not be optimistic. This highlights the need for comprehensive strategies that address both nutrition and overall treatment.
