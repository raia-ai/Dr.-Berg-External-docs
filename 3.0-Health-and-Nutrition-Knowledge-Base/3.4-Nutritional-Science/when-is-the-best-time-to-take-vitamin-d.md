# When is the best time to take vitamin D?

If you have a sleep problem, you may want to try taking your vitamin D before bed. Vitamin D may help increase your non-REM sleep. This is the deep delta wave sleep that occurs in the first half of sleep. Vitamin D may also help reduce your cortisol (stress) levels.

Most people will sleep fine, if not better, when they take vitamin D before bed. However, a small percentage of people may find that taking vitamin D before bed wakes them up. These people may need to take vitamin D earlier in the day.

Other great vitamins for sleep problems:

- Vitamin B5

- Folate

- Vitamin B1 (especially if you canâ€™t turn your brain off at night)
