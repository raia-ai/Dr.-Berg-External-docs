# What is the worst food for heart health?

Seed oils, such as vegetable oil, are industrial products processed multiple times and devoid of nutritional value. They are primarily composed of unstable polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), prone to oxidation and linked to numerous health risks. Consumption of seed oils contributes to inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and increased risk of heart disease and metabolic syndrome. Common in processed foods and cooking oils, they should be replaced with stable fats like butter, olive oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, and lard to maintain a healthier omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid balance.
