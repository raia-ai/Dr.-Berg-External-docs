There is something called creatine that converts to creatinine, which is a waste product. It’s supposed to go through the urine, but if it’s backing up into the blood, this can mean that there could potentially be a kidney problem or something else going on.

Creatine, in general, helps recycle ATP (an energy currency). Many people take creatine for their exercise performance.

**A few causes of high creatinine in the blood (but it’s low in the kidneys):**

1\. Kidney damage

2\. Ace inhibitors

3\. Intense exercise

4\. More muscle mass

5\. Too much dietary meat (cooked)

6\. Creatine supplements
