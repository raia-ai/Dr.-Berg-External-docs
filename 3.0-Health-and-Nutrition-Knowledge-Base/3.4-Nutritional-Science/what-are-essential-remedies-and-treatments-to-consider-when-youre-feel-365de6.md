# What are essential remedies and treatments to consider when you're feeling unwell or sick?

**To combat an infection, try to determine if you’re dealing with a viral infection or a bacterial infection.**

**Viral infection symptoms will be more systemic.** If you have a viral infection, you’ll notice more body aches and chills. Bacterial infection symptoms will be localized. Fevers are typically higher with a bacterial infection. A sore throat associated with a viral infection is often accompanied by a runny nose and a cough. If a sore throat is caused by a bacterial infection, you’ll feel more localized pain without a runny nose.

**A dry cough** is associated with a viral infection, while bacterial infections are associated with a productive cough. Respiratory infection, the common cold, flu, bronchitis, and infections involving the sinuses and lungs are generally viral. Pneumonia can be both bacterial and viral.

A viral infection typically lasts 1 to 2 weeks. A bacterial infection will probably last a bit longer, but this depends on your immune system. Mucus associated with a viral infection is usually clear or white and green or yellow with a bacterial infection.

**The best viral infection remedies are elderberry and olive leaf extract. For bacterial infections, try garlic, oregano oil, and echinacea.**

**The following remedies for infection work for both viral and bacterial infections:**

•Take a hot bath or shower/dress warm

•Get more sleep

•Take zinc, vitamin D, and vitamin C

•Fasting

•Increase sea salt intake

•Improve emotional state

•Get more sunlight (UVB and infrared rays)

•Take cod liver oil

**Stress, age, and poor gut health can increase your susceptibility to infection. Refined sugar and other refined foods deplete zinc and vitamin C, also increasing your susceptibility to infection.**
