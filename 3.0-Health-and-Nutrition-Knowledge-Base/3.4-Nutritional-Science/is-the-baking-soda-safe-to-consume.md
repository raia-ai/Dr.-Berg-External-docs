# Is the baking soda safe to consume?

**The stomach should be extremely acid with a pH between 1-3. This is normal.** You need your stomach acids to be at that pH to digest proteins, kill microbes, and absorb minerals. When food goes through the stomach and then into the small intestine, the pancreas releases bicarbonate. Our bodies are supposed to have bicarbonate in the small intestine, not the stomach, to neutralize the stomach acid so it doesn’t damage the small intestine. Bicarbonates are alkaline. Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. If you’re putting baking soda into your stomach, you’re going to mess up your digestion down the road.

Taking apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride can help increase stomach acid and potentially help with acid reflux. A combination of betaine hydrochloride and zinc carnosine may also be effective.
