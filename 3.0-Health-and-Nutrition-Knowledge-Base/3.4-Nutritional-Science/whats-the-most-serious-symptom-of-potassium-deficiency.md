# What's the most serious symptom of potassium deficiency?

Potassium is essential for our health, and we need a substantial amount—approximately 4700 mg daily! Unfortunately, many people's diets are heavily skewed towards processed foods high in sodium and low in potassium, leading to an imbalance in the critical sodium-potassium ratio. Ideally, this ratio should be 2:1 in favor of potassium.

This balance is vital as every cell relies on a sodium-potassium pump to generate electrical currents, which are the driving force behind our nervous and muscular systems. Additionally, potassium plays a significant role in maintaining healthy blood vessels, and a deficiency can contribute to high blood pressure—a condition often overlooked in conventional medicine despite its prevalence.

A lack of potassium can manifest in various ways, including fatigue, muscle problems, constipation, tremors, irregular heartbeat, mental disturbances, headaches, low back pain, dizziness, excessive nighttime urination, swelling, elevated pulse rate, and even an increased risk of stroke. The most alarming consequence of severe potassium deficiency is sudden cardiac death, with a tenfold increase in risk for those with low levels.

To avoid such complications, it's crucial to incorporate potassium-rich foods into your diet. Leafy greens, squash, nuts, shellfish, bone broth, avocado, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds are excellent sources.

Conversely, a diet high in refined sugars, starches, and grains, coupled with stress, steroid use, gut inflammation, and alcohol consumption, can deplete your potassium levels. It's essential to be mindful of these factors to maintain a healthy balance and safeguard your well-being.
