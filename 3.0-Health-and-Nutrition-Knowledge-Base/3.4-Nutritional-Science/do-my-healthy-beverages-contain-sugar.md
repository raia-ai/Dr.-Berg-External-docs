# Do my healthy beverages contain sugar?

## **Sugar Content in Common Beverages**

**Sports Drinks**

Popular for electrolyte replenishment, sports drinks like Gatorade contain about 21 grams of sugar per 20-ounce bottleâ€”equivalent to over 5 teaspoons. For most, water and a balanced snack suffice.

**Flavored Coffee**

Flavored coffees, such as a 16-ounce Starbucks vanilla latte, can contain up to 25 grams of sugar, or over 6 teaspoons. Opt for plain coffee with a splash of milk or sugar-free syrups to reduce sugar intake.

**Iced Tea**

Commercially available iced teas can have up to 33 grams of sugar per 16-ounce bottle, exceeding 8 teaspoons. Homemade iced tea with unsweetened tea bags and a touch of honey or lemon is a healthier alternative.
