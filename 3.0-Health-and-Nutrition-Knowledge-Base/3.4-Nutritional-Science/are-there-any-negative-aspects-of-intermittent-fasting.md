# Are there any negative aspects of intermittent fasting?

Intermittent fasting is very beneficial for people who are able to successfully implement it. It can lead to weight less, cell regeneration, less unhealthy cravings, better blood sugar control and much more.

While most people will gain great benefits from adopting intermittent fasting, women that are pregnant or breastfeeding should not adopt this eating pattern, as they require a higher level of nutrient intake. In addition, those with a history of eating disorders should not try intermittent fasting as it could trigger harmful tendencies. Aside from these groups, intermittent fasting is a transformative way of eating that can improve anyone's health and well-being.
