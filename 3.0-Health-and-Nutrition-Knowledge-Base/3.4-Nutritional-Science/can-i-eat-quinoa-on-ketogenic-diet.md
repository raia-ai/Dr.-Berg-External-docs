# Can I eat quinoa on ketogenic diet?

You cannot. Although Quinoa is very low on the glycemic index, it can still spike your blood sugars. It is gluten-free but it is processed in many factories that also process wheat - so it could be exposed to gluten. And it has a compound similar to gluten that could also create a similar inflammatory reaction on the gut.
