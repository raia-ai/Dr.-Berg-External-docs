# Does Vitamin D3 support nerve function?

Vitamin D3 supports nerve health in several crucial ways:

- **Neuroprotection:** Contributes to healthy nerve function and may support the body's natural defenses against oxidative stress.  

- **Neuropathic Pain:** Vitamin D receptors are present in nerve tissue and may be involved in how pain is felt and communicated. 

- **Myelin Sheath Maintenance:** Vitamin D is involved in maintaining the health of the myelin sheath, a vital component of nerve fibers. Adequate Vitamin D levels contribute to overall nerve health and function. 

- **Immune Response:** Vitamin D may contribute to a healthy immune response.
