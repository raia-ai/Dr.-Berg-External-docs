# What are effective strategies for managing foot numbness after lumbar surgery, and how can underlying issues be addressed to aid recovery?

To address numbness in your feet after lumbar surgery:

1\. **B Vitamins**: Take B12 (preferably methylcobalamin) and benfotiamine, which supports nerve health and myelin sheath regeneration. Consider taking benfotiamine in higher doses, spread throughout the day.

2\. **Low-Carb Diet**: Follow a low-carb diet to minimize the risk of exacerbating neuropathy, as diabetes can worsen nerve issues.

These measures can help support nerve recovery and reduce numbness.
