# What strategies can be employed to address feelings of fatigue when unable to fall asleep?

**Try these 7 tips for falling asleep easier when youâ€™re tired:**

1\. No water past 7 pm - Consuming water before bed can cause you to feel like you have to use the restroom, especially if you have insulin resistance or pre-diabetes.

2\. Limit caffeine intake - One 8oz cup of coffee a day should be your limit. Excess caffeine can make it difficult to fall asleep.

3\. Limit protein - Too much protein can act as a stimulant. Keep your protein consumption to 3 to 8 oz per meal.

4\. Use up body energy - Having too much energy before bed can make it difficult to fall asleep. Try using up your energy by going on long walks, exercising, and doing physical work.

5\. Catch the first circadian wave - Your first circadian wave is typically around 9:30 pm. Try to catch this wave to make falling to sleep easier.

6\. Take a sleep aid before bed - Natural sleep aids can help you get to sleep faster when it comes time for bed. Calcium lactate is a great natural supplement that can help with sleep.

7\. Keep your room on the colder side - A warm body temperate may keep you up at night. People tend to sleep better in a slightly cool environment.
