# What signs or changes in the eyes can indicate fluctuations in blood sugar levels, and how do these ocular symptoms relate to overall metabolic health?

Here are seven things your eyes reveal about your blood sugar levels:

1\. Puffy eyelids and edema indicate high sugar, as excess glucose causes fluid retention.

2\. Glaucoma, caused by high sugar levels leading to increased intraocular pressure, results from glycation and abnormal blood vessel formation.

3\. Cataracts occur when high sugar levels misfold lens proteins and deplete vitamin B1; supplements like B1 and carnosine can help.

4\. Retinopathy, damaging the retina and nerves, can lead to blindness; benfotiamine, a B1 supplement, may aid repair alongside dietary changes.

5\. Macular degeneration affects focus and is influenced by diet; lutein helps but diet improvements are crucial.

6\. Red, irritated eyes result from inflammation and damaged blood vessels due to high sugar; blood sugar normalization is necessary.

7\. Dry eyes, often from vitamin A deficiency and low zinc, are exacerbated by high sugar, which depletes zinc levels.
