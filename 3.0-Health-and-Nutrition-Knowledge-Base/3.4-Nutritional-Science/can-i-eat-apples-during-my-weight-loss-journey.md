# Can I eat apples during my weight loss journey?

I used to think apples were a great snack. I even used to recommend apples to help with weight loss, but I don’t anymore.  

Recently I looked up the nutritional profile of an apple, and this is what I found:

• Saturated fats — .1g

• Cholesterol — 0g 

• Carbohydrates — 25g

• Fiber — 44g

• Sugar — 19g

Apples have enough sugar to stop fat burning for at least one to two days. 

At least until you’re at your ideal weight, I don’t think consuming apples (or any fruit) is a good idea.
