# How should I time my meals for optimal blood sugar control?

In addition to choosing the right foods, timing your meals correctly can also play a significant role in managing hunger and blood sugar levels.

Aim to eat regular, balanced meals throughout the day, focusing on nutrient-dense foods that provide sustained energy.

Avoid skipping meals, which can lead to overeating later in the day and contribute to imbalances in blood sugar.

If you feel hungry between meals, reach for healthy snacks like vegetables with hummus, or a handful of nuts to tide you over until your next meal.
