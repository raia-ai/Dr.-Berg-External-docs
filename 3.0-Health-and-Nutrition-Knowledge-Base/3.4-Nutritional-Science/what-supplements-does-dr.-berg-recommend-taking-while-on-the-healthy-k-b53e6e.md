# What supplements does Dr. Berg recommend taking while on the healthy Ketogenic Diet?

Dr. Berg recommends several supplements to take while on the ketogenic diet for optimal health and functionality. Here are some of them:

**1\. Magnesium:** Many people, even those who are not on the ketogenic diet, struggle with magnesium deficiency due to poor dietary choices and even certain medications that can deplete the body’s supply of magnesium. Ideally, keto dieters should make sure they are getting at least 200–400 mg of magnesium each day.

**2\. Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Omega-3s can reduce inflammation, improve brain health, and decrease a person’s risk of heart disease, making them a very valuable item to have in your high-fat diet, either eaten as food or as a supplement.

**3\. Vitamin B5:** This vitamin is important for the conversion from sugar to fat burning; it helps in keto-adaptation and prevents ketogenic fatigue, flu, and rash.

**4\. Vitamin A:** This vitamin improves insulin resistance.

**5\. Vitamin D:** This vitamin also improves insulin resistance.

**6\. Choline:** This nutrient helps a fatty liver.

**7\. Minerals:** First up are the major minerals: potassium, magnesium, sodium, and calcium. These four are what are called electrolytes—electrically charged minerals that maintain fluid throughout your body. Trace minerals such as iron, manganese, and copper are also beneficial when you’re on a keto diet. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.
