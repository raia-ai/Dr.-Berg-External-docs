# Is licorice root in supplements heathy?

Licorice root in supplements can be healthy when used appropriately. Dr. Berg highlights its numerous benefits, such as helping to balance cortisol levels, reducing inflammation, supporting liver detoxification, and aiding conditions like ulcers, gastritis, and viral hepatitis. It is also an adaptogen, meaning it helps the body manage stress by regulating cortisol levels.

Dr. Berg uses licorice root in his Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula supplement because of its adaptogenic properties and ability to support adrenal health and stress relief. However, he cautions against excessive use, as it can lead to side effects like potassium loss, sodium retention, or increased blood pressure in sensitive individuals.
