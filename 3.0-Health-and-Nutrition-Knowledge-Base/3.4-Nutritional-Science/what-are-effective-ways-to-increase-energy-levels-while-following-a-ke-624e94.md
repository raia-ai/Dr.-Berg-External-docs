# What are effective ways to increase energy levels while following a ketogenic diet?

Feeling tired on keto can result from poor sleep, stress, nutritional deficiencies, or the adaptation phase as your body transitions to burning fat. Increasing B vitamins or potassium may help.

Fatigue can also be linked to mitochondrial health. Mitochondria produce ATP, and oxidative stress from smoking, pollution, and high sugar can damage them. Antioxidants, especially from whole foods like cruciferous vegetables and omega-3-rich sources, help combat this damage.

Avoid synthetic antioxidants; focus on natural sources. If you're not getting enough high-quality vegetables, consider adding a plant-based shake for a week to boost energy. Keto can be challenging, but itâ€™s a protective mechanism worth maintaining!
