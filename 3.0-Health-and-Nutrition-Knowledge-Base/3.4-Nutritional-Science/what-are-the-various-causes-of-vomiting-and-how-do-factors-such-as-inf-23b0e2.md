# What are the various causes of vomiting, and how do factors such as infections, dietary issues, and medical conditions contribute to this symptom?

Nausea is discomfort and uneasiness that makes you want to throw up or vomit. Usually it’s a one-time event linked to something that doesn’t settle right in the stomach. Most of the time, vomiting is harmless, but if it’s recurring, it can be a sign of a more serious illness.

**Cause #1: Gallbladder problems / bile duct**

The gallbladder is a very important organ for your body as it stores bile. Bile is very important for our digestion and breakdown of fats. If you take something that your digestive system is not used to, this can overload your gallbladder ducts and cause confusion in your stomach. As a result you can feel nauseous.

**Other causes:**

- Motion sickness

- Food poisoning

- Chemotherapy

- Low blood sugar

- Medications/drugs

- Kidney stones

- Pregnancy
