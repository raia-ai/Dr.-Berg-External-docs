# Can I add honey to the apple cider vinegar drink for keto?

No. About 56% of honey is fructose and 44% of it is glucose. Honey has a glycemic index of 78, which is high. The problem with fructose is that only the cells in the liver can deal with it. So, fructose puts a lot of stress on the liver and can create a lot of additional problems. If you had to choose between honey and sugar, honey might be the better option because it has some antioxidants and some antimicrobial properties. It may also help with certain allergies. But, overall, honey is low in actual nutrients. It may be better than refined sugar, but not by much.
