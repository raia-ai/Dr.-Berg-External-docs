# What are the benefits of Vitamin B12 in the Hair Formula?

**Vitamin B12 (as methylcobalamin)** 

Vitamin B12, particularly in the form of methylcobalamin, offers several benefits for hair health: 

- **Hair Growth:** Vitamin B12 is vital for the production of red blood cells, which transport oxygen and nutrients throughout the body, including the scalp and hair follicles. 

- **Hair Health:** Vitamin B12 contributes to healthy blood circulation, which delivers oxygen and nutrients to the scalp and hair follicles. Adequate nourishment is important for overall hair health. 

- **Keratin Production:** Vitamin B12 is involved in the production of keratin, a protein that is a major component of hair structure. 

- **Scalp Health:** Vitamin B12 plays a role in cell turnover, which is a natural process important for maintaining healthy skin, including the scalp.
