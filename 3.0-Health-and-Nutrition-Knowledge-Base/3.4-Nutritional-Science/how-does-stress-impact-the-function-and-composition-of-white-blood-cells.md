# How does stress impact the function and composition of white blood cells?

**Stress, primarily regulated by cortisol, plays a critical role in immune function:**

**1\. Cortisol's Role:** Cortisol suppresses white blood cells, key components of the immune system, under stress conditions.

**2\. Types of Stress:** Acute stress is short-term, while chronic stress, which elevates cortisol levels persistently, can lead to cortisol resistance akin to insulin resistance.

**3\. Implications of Chronic Stress:** Elevated cortisol levels can impair immune response, potentially increasing susceptibility to illness and health complications.

**4\. Factors Influencing Immunity:** Chronic stress, combined with nutrient deficiencies or other factors, can compromise immune function, making individuals more vulnerable to infections and health issues.

**5\. Viral Impact:** Viral infections can further impact immune function by inducing nutrient deficiencies or hindering vitamin D absorption, which may exacerbate health challenges.
