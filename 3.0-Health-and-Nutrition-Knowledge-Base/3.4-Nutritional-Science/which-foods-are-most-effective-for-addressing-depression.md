# Which foods are most effective for addressing depression?

**The first thing that comes to mind would be vitamin D. Vitamin D.** There is another remedy that has been known to be very, very effective and it's called methylene blue. It's the first synthetic drug that ever was developed in medicine. But there's some interesting properties. It will make your urine turn blue, but apparently it's really good for depression. But vitamin D is really key. Also light therapy. And that would be the most potent.

**What foods are high in vitamin D?** Well, you have salmon, cod liver oil, things like that. There's not a lot of foods that have vitamin D in them. So enough anyway. So you might want to just take that as a supplement at least 20,000 IUs.

Now, if that is your problem, right? And you take 2000 IUs of vitamin D3 and you're like I tried vitamin D, it didn't work. Well, I've been doing a lot of valuations in people that have DNA problems. And I'm finding hands down the great majority of them nearly always have problems with vitamin D in the converting the inactive to the active in the absorption, which means that the average person that I've tested at (25:18) least needs to take a larger amounts of vitamin D than they were before to create the effects (25:23) that they're trying to create.

IMPORTANT: Do not take methylene blue with an SSRI or anti-anxiety medication. This combination can be lethal. Methylene blue has many known drug interactions. Always consult with your perscribing doctor and/or pharmacist before starting methylene blue use.
