# What's the main purpose of magnesium?

Magnesium is needed in a lot of different functions in the body, but its primary purpose is to act as a calcium antagonist. Calcium is very toxic in the body unless it’s in normal amounts.

Taking 500mg or more of calcium per day could potentially increase your risk of a heart attack or stroke. Calcium is essential, but we need it in smaller amounts. Calcium doesn’t exit the body very easily. There are even many different disease processes out there that involve the accumulation of calcium. Magnesium is the key mineral to help prevent this.

**Hypercalcemia is a condition where there is too much calcium in the blood.**

Symptoms of hypercalcemia:

• Arrhythmias

• Abdominal pain

• Paralytic ileus

• Vomiting

• Excessive or reduced urination

• Psychosis

• Strong desire for sleep

• Constipation
