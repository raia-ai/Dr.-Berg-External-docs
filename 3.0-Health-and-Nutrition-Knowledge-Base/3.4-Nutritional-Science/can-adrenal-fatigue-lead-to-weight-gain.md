# Can adrenal fatigue lead to weight gain?

Adrenal fatigue, particularly chronic stress, can lead to weight gain, exacerbated by poor dietary habits. Cortisol, released during stress, increases energy (sugar) storage as fat when unused, and can degrade muscle mass by converting it into sugar. Additionally, cortisol inhibits fat burning, making ketosis difficult.

Addressing stress sources is crucial. Implementing Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting can help, along with ensuring adequate intake of vitamin D, vitamin C, and potassium.
