# What are the underlying causes of food sensitivities?

If you have an allergy or high sensitivity to certain foods this can cause indigestion, and specifically inflammation in some parts of your body-including the abdomen. If your body is not used to certain foods this can cause irritation or discomfort in the abdominal area.

**Remedies:**

**When you have abdominal discomfort, look over what you ate several hours before that. Avoid that type of food next time.**

Most common foods causing allergic reactions:

- Peanuts

- Gluten

- Dairy products

- Too much caffeine (note: withdrawal symptoms can last up to two weeks)

- Chocolate

- Tobacco

- Alcohol

- Artificial sweeteners

- Sugar alcohols

- MSG (usually in the form of modified food starch)

- Cured meats

- Aged cheeses (blue, feta, parmesan)

- Pickled, fermented foods
