# What are the most effective and expedited strategies for promoting rapid healing of an ulcer?

**Simple Remedy for Ulcers**

**Causes of Ulcers:**

\- Stress

\- Nutritional deficiencies

\- H. pylori

\- NSAIDs

**Common Medication:** Prilosec stops stomach acid production but has many side effects, including:

\- Vomiting, gas, nausea, headaches

\- Abdominal pain

\- Increased risk of dementia, C. diff, pneumonia, bone fractures, kidney inflammation, and polyps

**Natural Remedy:** Cabbage

Cabbage contains vitamin U (sulfur compounds) which can destroy H. pylori, a common cause of ulcers. H. pylori becomes pathogenic when stomach acid is low, not high. Consuming raw, juiced, steamed, or fermented cabbage can help treat ulcers. Avoid overcooking to preserve its beneficial compounds.
