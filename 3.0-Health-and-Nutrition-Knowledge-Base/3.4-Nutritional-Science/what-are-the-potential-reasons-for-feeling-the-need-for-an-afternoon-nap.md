# What are the potential reasons for feeling the need for an afternoon nap?

Need for an afternoon nap can create difficulties in your day. The important thing to know is that it is a condition which is connected to your blood sugars. Fixing your diet will remedy the need for naps during the day.

**Cause #1: Blood sugar crash**

Consuming carbs and sweets will increase blood sugar. Your body will lower the blood sugar amounts below normal levels by producing Insulin (fat-storing hormone). As a result, low blood sugar will cause sleepiness, low energy as well as will cause you to feel hungry, even though you just ate recently. This can be the cause of needing to nap during the day.

**Cause #2: Low stomach acid**

We need high stomach acidity to be able to break down and digest the load of food that we consume. If your stomach is not acidic enough, this can result in the food just sitting there in the stomach and not being digested fast enough. This can cause afternoon sleepiness.

**Cause #3: Poor quality of sleep**

If you had a bad night of sleep this can result in the need for an afternoon nap. If your sleep quality is high and you rest and recover well at night, then you will not feel sleepy during the day, provided that your blood sugar levels are normal and food is digested well.
