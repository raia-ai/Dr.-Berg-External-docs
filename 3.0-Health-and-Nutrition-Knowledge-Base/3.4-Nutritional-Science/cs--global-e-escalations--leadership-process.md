        ·       For this example order: #2093970

        ·       When a customer calls stating they didn’t receive their order. You search for the order ID in ProPack, you confirm it was delivered to a different country.

        ·       You want to check if ProPack used the wrong tracking number for this order.

        ·       When you click on the tracking numberUnder more shipping details -> copy and paste the waybill number

    - Go back to Global-e -> orders -> Merchant hub -> process orders

    - Tracking number -> enter the waybill number -> Find and View.

    - Copy the order ID -> search in Global-e who that order number belongs too.

    - Under Merchant Order ID: Copy and search under ProPack to see who it belongs too.

        Once you search and you check the shipment: you will notice it’s the same tracking number.

        You email ProPack to do an investigation to see what happened and reship the order that the label was not scanned.
