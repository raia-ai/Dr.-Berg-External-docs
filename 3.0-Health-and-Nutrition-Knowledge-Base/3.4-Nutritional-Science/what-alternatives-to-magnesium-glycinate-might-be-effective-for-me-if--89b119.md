# What alternatives to magnesium glycinate might be effective for me if I experience headaches as a side effect?

If you experience headaches with magnesium glycinate, you might be getting sufficient magnesium from other sources. Consider switching to magnesium citrate, which is often better tolerated. If headaches persist, it may indicate that you don't need additional magnesium. Opting for magnesium-rich foods could be a more suitable approach.
