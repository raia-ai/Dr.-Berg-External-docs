# What specific dermatological signs can indicate diabetes?

High blood glucose affects the skin both directly and indirectly. Insulin, a hormone that helps lower glucose, can also affect the skin. When you have high blood glucose, you’ll typically also have high insulin and insulin resistance, at least in the beginning.

1\. Petechiae and purpura

2\. Gangrene

3\. Ulcers in the legs or feet

4\. Swollen red eyelids
