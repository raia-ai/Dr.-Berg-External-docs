# Can vitamin deficiencies contribute to low back pain

Lower back pain, especially chronic pain, is often treated with medications, but understanding the root causes can lead to long-term relief. Nutritional deficiencies play a significant role in back pain:

1\. **Vitamin D**: Deficiency can cause bone pain, inflammation, soft bones, and skeletal problems in children. Magnesium and boron deficiencies can also affect vitamin D levels, leading to back issues.

2\. **Vitamin K2**: Deficiency can result in stenosis, arthritis, bone spurs, and calcium deposits. Vitamin K2 works synergistically with vitamin D.

3\. **Vitamin E**: Deficiency can cause back weakness and atrophy. Prefer tocotrienol complexes or wheat germ oil over tocopherols.

4\. **Manganese**: Deficiency can lead to disc problems, collagen issues, and an increased risk of scoliosis.

Other contributors to back pain include an imbalance of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, a high sugar and carbohydrate diet, kidney stones, and gallstones. Addressing these nutritional deficiencies and dietary factors can help alleviate chronic back pain.
