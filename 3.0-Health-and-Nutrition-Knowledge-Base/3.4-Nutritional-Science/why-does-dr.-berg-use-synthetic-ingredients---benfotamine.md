# Why Does Dr. Berg Use Synthetic Ingredients - Benfotamine

**Why Are Synthetic Ingredients Used in Dr. Berg’s Products?**

In the world of supplements, natural isn’t always better, and synthetic doesn’t mean unsafe or inferior. Synthetic ingredients are often chosen because they’re the only way to deliver precise, powerful, and proven results. Here’s why certain synthetic ingredients are used in Dr. Berg’s formulas:

**Benfotiamine (Synthetic Vitamin B1)**

Superior Absorption: Benfotiamine is specifically designed for your body to utilize it, unlike standard thiamine, which passes through the body quickly. This synthetic form is fat-soluble, so it crosses cell membranes and reaches nerve tissues where it’s needed most.

Targeted Benefits: You’d have to take large doses of standard thiamine to match the effectiveness of benfotiamine. This form was created specifically to help support nerve health in a way that natural thiamine simply can’t.

 Exclusively Synthetic: Benfotiamine isn’t found in nature—it must be created in a lab. This synthetic form ensures a consistently pure, potent, and bioavailable dose that nature does not provide.

Bottom Line: Benfotiamine isn’t used to avoid natural ingredients—it’s used because it is not found in nature and works better, faster, and more reliably than standard natural thiamine.
