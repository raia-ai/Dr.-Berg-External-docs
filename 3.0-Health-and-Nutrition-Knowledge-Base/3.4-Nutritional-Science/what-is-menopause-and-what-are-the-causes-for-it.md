# What is menopause and what are the causes for it?

**Understanding Menopause and Your Body**

Your hypothalamus, a region in your brain, plays a key role in regulating your menstrual cycle. Around age 52, menopause occurs naturally as ovarian function declines, leading to a change in hormone levels. Your adrenal glands partially compensate for this shift.

Menopause can cause various symptoms, including:

- Hot flashes

- Night sweats

- Anxiety and mood changes

- Stress

- Muscle loss

- Potential bone density changes

**Supporting Your Well-being**

Taking care of your adrenals is an important way to potentially manage menopausal symptoms. This includes:

- Prioritizing quality sleep

- Managing stress levels

- Considering ways to support healthy cortisol balance

Additionally, your pituitary gland stores vitamin E, and levels may naturally decrease during menopause. A high-quality vitamin E complex might be helpful in reducing symptoms. Iodine from sea kelp could also offer support by potentially balancing estrogen levels.

**Liver Health Matters**

While supporting your adrenals is important, your liver also plays a crucial role in managing menopause. Your liver helps detoxify your body, including processing excess hormones. Liver function can naturally change with age.

To support your liver health, consider:

- Eating cruciferous vegetables (or supplementing with DIM)

- Exploring calcium D-glucarate supplementation

- Consulting a healthcare professional about potential detox options

- Discussing ways to support healthy liver circulation
