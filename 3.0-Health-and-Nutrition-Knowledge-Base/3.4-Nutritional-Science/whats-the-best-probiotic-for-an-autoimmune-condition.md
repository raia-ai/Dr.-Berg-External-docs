# What's the best probiotic for an autoimmune condition?

An autoimmune disease is a condition in which the immune system attacks its own tissues. It is typically characterized by low regulatory T-cells and high Th17 and Th2 cells. T-reg cells prevent autoimmune diseases by supporting an appropriate immune response. There are natural ways to support your immune system so that it operates at an optimal level. Poor gut health and gut inflammation can block the function of vitamin D3. Without enough vitamin D, T-reg cells do not work properly.

The majority of the population is vitamin D-resistant. To support the immune system, you need 8,000 to 10,000 IU of vitamin D daily, but even more to overcome resistance. Poor gut health, inflammation, and low vitamin D are a perfect storm for developing an autoimmune condition.

B. infantis and L. reuteri are vital for your immune system, but many people don’t have them because these probiotics are very sensitive to antibiotics. These two important microbes help prevent autoimmune diseases, greatly affect T-reg cells, and suppress inflammatory immune cells.

L. reuteri helps increase oxytocin, one of the most potent anti-stress hormones. High cortisol levels mean high stress, which suppresses the immune system. The best way to consume l. reuteri is to cultivate it in a dairy product.

If you’re low in selenium, you will have higher amounts of inflammatory immune cells. Selenium helps lower Th17, Th2 cells, and auto-antibodies involved in autoimmune disorders. Prolonged fasting can improve your immune system by increasing T-reg cells and creating new stem cells.
