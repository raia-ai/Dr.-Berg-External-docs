Eating fatty protein or fat with protein prevents a high insulin spike, which lowers your blood sugar. Avoiding this dip in blood sugar can reduce cravings and curb hunger. Eating fiber also helps buffer the insulin response. Light exercise, like a long walk, is excellent for your blood sugar and can help reduce cravings. An extra 30 minutes of sleep significantly reduces cortisol, stabilizing blood sugar and suppressing appetite naturally. Minimize stress with exercise, physical work, sleep, a healthy diet, and stretching. Ashwagandha is also beneficial, along with magnesium glycinate before bed.
