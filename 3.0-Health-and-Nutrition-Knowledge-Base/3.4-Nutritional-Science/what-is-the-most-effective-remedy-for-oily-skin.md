# What is the most effective remedy for oily skin?

You have a situation of overactive sebaceous glands pumping out sebum. This is because of too much androgen hormone. You can take zinc to lower androgen. But what's really behind this problem is either too much stress or too much insulin. Fixing insulin resistance can really help your skin.

There is a naturally concentrated phytonutrient called DIM which can also support healthy androgen and estrogen levels. It's great for PCOS and supports healthy skin.
