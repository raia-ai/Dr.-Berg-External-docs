# Does exercising mess up my sleep routine?

If your heart is healthy and resilient and elastic, then the body can handle higher intensity type exercise (anaerobic and HIIT). HIIT stands for high-intensity interval training. However, if the heart is not recovering well, then walking is best and maybe even doing higher intensity exercise in the am.

Walking is a low-stress, higher oxygen type exercise (aerobic), and better for stress. If you had a history of being an athlete or doing a sport that involved lots of cardio, then your cells have developed a larger capacity to use energy and you will need to do regular exercise to release that energy.
