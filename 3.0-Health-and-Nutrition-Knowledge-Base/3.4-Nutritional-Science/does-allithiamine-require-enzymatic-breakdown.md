# Does Allithiamine require enzymatic breakdown?

Allithiamine does not need enzymatic breakdown like some other forms of thiamine. It is a lipid-soluble form of vitamin B1, which means it can be absorbed more efficiently and bypass some of the transport mechanisms that regular thiamine requires. This lipid solubility is due to its chemical structure, which includes an allyl disulfide group, allowing it to cross cell membranes more efficiently without needing enzyme conversion.
