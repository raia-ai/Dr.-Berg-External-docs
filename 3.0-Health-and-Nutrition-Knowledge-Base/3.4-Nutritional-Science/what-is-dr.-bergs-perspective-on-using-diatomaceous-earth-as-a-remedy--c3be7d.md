# What is Dr. Berg's perspective on using diatomaceous earth as a remedy for parasites, and what are the potential benefits and risks associated with its use?

It's a very good remedy for parasites. These parasites are exposed to this thing and it literally cuts their internally. It just destroys them from the inside out. But parasites, we all have them to a certain degree. It's just a matter of keeping our defenses against them. And so the best thing is to take a good probiotic or eat foods that are filled with probiotics like the sauerkraut, the kimchi, kefir, those types of things. But there's other remedies too.

**The black walnut hull extract garlic,** a really good remedy for parasites. But there's many different plant-based herbs that are anti-parasitic. But build up your gut and then also good stomach acid by maybe taking the supplement.

**Betaine hydrochloride** is another really good thing to make sure you don't have any parasites that slip through the barrier of the stomach acid when you eat foods.
