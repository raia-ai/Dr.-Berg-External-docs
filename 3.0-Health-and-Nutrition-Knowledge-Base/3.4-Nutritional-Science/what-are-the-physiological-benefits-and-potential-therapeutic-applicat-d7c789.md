Your body makes inositol, and it’s most abundant in your brain. It’s actually a sugar alcohol made from glucose. It can help with insulin resistance, blood sugars, and even carb cravings. In large doses (2000 mg twice per day with a little bit of folate) inositol may actually help with conditions like ADD, OCD, overwhelm, depression and problems with binge eating.

Myo-inositol is the type of inositol you might want to take, as it is the most bioavailable version of it. Additionally, you can get IP-6 inositol for the benefits mentioned above. You can get these at a health food store or order them online.
