# What are the common symptoms associated with histamine intolerance?

Histamine is involved in the immune system, and it’s present in certain foods. If you have histamine intolerance, your body will react to it with inflammation, fatigue, congestion and other symptoms.

Additionally, if you’ve had damage to your stomach or your intestines you could be deficient in a certain enzyme that helps you break down histamines.

**Symptoms:**

- Headaches

- Migraines

- Stuffy sinuses

- Diarrhea

- Asthma

- Palpitations

- Red skin

- Hives/itchiness

- Vertigo

- Low blood pressure

Consuming foods high in histamines

Consuming foods high in histamines will cause them to be high in your body. Your body as a result can treat them as dangerous compounds and activate your immune system when they are detected, causing a reaction to them.
