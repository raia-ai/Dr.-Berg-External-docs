# What are the most important signs of calcium deficiency?

While getting your blood calcium levels checked is a good starting point, this method doesn't tell the complete story.

Thatâ€™s because standard tests measure total serum calcium, which includes both the free, usable calcium and calcium bound to protein, which your body cannot use efficiently.

To gain a more accurate understanding of your calcium status, ask your healthcare provider for an "ionized calcium" test.

This specific test looks at the amount of readily available, active calcium, painting a clearer picture of potential deficiencies. It can help tailor interventions, whether through diet or in some cases, supplementation to effectively address your needs.

### **Common Signs That You Might Be Low in Calcium**

[Calcium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/calcium-goes-way-beyond-the-bones) is still vital for several bodily functions. Recognizing signs of deficiency can prompt timely intervention:

- Muscle Spasms or Twitches: Calcium plays a critical role in muscle function, so experiencing spasms, cramps, or twitches could signify a deficiency.

- Tetany: Characterized by involuntary muscle contractions, tetany, particularly in the eyelids or arms, can result from low calcium, although other mineral imbalances can also contribute. It highlights the delicate interplay of minerals in your body.

- Numbness or Tingling: Experiencing these sensations around your mouth or in your extremities could point toward a calcium dip. Calcium is crucial for nerve transmission, and these odd sensations could signal impaired nerve function.

- Heart Rate Fluctuations: Calcium contributes to regulating your heartbeat, so experiencing an erratic heart rate might stem from inadequate levels.

- Larynx Spasm: Affecting the vocal cords, low calcium can manifest as hoarseness, a change in your voice, or even a feeling of having a lump in your throat.
