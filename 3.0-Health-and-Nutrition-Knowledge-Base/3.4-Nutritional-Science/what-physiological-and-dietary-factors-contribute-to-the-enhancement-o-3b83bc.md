# What physiological and dietary factors contribute to the enhancement of bile salt synthesis and secretion?

Bile is made in the liver and then stored in your gallbladder.

The purpose of your gallbladder is to concentrate the bile to make digesting fats effectively, thus allowing your body to extract fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids from the fat you eat. If you don’t have a gallbladder, bile simply trickles from your liver into your intestine and is less effective.

Bile also helps lubricate your colon, and it kills certain bad bacteria along with helping you maintain microbial health.

**Here are the ten things you can consume to increase bile production, even if you don’t have a gallbladder:**

1\. Beet tops

2\. Ginger

3\. Artichokes

4\. Lemon

5\. Dandelion

6\. Milk thistle

7\. Choline

8\. Turmeric

9\. Betaine

10\. Bile salts
