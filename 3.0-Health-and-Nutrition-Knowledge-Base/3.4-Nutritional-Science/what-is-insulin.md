# What is insulin?

Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that lowers blood sugar and allows cells to absorb nutrients. Insulin is like a key that unlocks cells and opens the door to allow glucose and nutrition to go into the cells. Insulin stores sugar in the liver and muscle, in the form of glycogen that is released for quick energy. It is also a fat-making hormone that will convert extra sugar into body fat.

The problem with insulin roots in too much insulin due to too much dietary sugar, as insulin in itself is not bad for your body. High amounts of sugar will trigger high amounts of insulin, and as a result your cells eventually are going to resist excess insulin; initially your pancreas will produce more insulin to counter this resistance. Over time, the pancreas becomes exhausted and produces less insulin leaving the blood sugars uncontrolled. This condition is called insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is behind many body problems, including type 2 diabetes but also metabolic syndrome.
