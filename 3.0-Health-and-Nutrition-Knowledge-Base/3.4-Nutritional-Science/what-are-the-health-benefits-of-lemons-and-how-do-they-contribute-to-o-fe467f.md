# What are the health benefits of lemons, and how do they contribute to overall well-being?

Many people know fresh lemons contain citrates, which lower the risk of kidney stones. They may also know that lemons are rich in vitamin C. But another secret weapon lemons have is called flavonoids. Flavonoids have powerful, wide-ranging effects.

One specific flavonoid in lemons can help remove fat from the liver, balance lipids in the liver, and support healthy blood sugar levels. It also helps protect the integrity of the capillaries.

**Other potential health benefits of lemons:**

To maximize the benefits of consuming lemons, you can make a simple drink using the whole lemon rather than just lemon juice. Try blending one whole lemon with 12 ounces of water and a few drops of stevia or my Electrolyte Powder for a delicious, healthy lemon drink. You can also add apple cider vinegar for additional benefits. For best results, enjoy this drink in the mornings.
