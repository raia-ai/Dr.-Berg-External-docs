# What part of the ocean are the fish sourced for Cod Liver Oil Capsules?

While I can confirm the general region where our cod are sourced, tracking their exact origin is difficult. Cod are migratory fish, covering vast distances from Greenland to North Carolina. Pinpointing a specific fishing location for each individual is currently not possible.
