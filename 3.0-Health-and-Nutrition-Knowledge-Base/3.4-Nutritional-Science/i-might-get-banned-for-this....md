The current recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is a mere 600 IU (international units), a surprisingly small amount considering its vast potential health benefits. This has sparked controversy, likely due to the numerous conditions vitamin D may positively impact.

In the early 1900s, before modern medicine, heliotherapy (sunbathing) was used to treat a wide range of ailments, including tuberculosis, asthma, osteoporosis, tooth decay, psoriasis, mood disorders, diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer.

A nine-year study conducted by the University of Illinois Chicago, commissioned by the government, involving hundreds of doctors, patients, and even dogs, found no toxicity even at extremely high doses of vitamin D (200,000-1,000,000 IU).

Despite this, Dr. Bruce Hollis, a leading vitamin D researcher, notes that many in the field are hesitant to embrace the extensive data supporting its benefits.

Interestingly, data shows that populations living closer to the equator, with higher sun exposure and thus greater vitamin D levels, have lower rates of multiple sclerosis, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and diabetes.

Factors like vitamin D resistance, age, darker skin, and higher body weight can increase your vitamin D needs. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the optimal dosage for your individual circumstances.
