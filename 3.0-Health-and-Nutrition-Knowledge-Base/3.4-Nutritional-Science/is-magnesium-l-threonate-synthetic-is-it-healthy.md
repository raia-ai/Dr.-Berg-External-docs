# Is Magnesium L-threonate synthetic? Is it healthy?

Magnesium L-threonate is a synthesized form of magnesium created by combining magnesium with L-threonic acid, a vitamin C derivative. While it is not naturally occurring, Dr. Berg considers it a healthy and effective supplement due to its unique ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, making it highly bioavailable for brain health. It supports memory, learning, focus, and cognitive function and may also reduce anxiety and neuroinflammation.

Dr. Berg highlights that magnesium L-threonate is particularly beneficial for improving brain magnesium levels, which other forms of magnesium cannot achieve. It is generally well-tolerated, though its specialized manufacturing process can make it more expensive.
