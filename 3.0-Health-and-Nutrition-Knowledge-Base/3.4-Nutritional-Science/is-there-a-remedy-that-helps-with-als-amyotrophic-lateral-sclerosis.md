# Is there a remedy that helps with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)?

ALS, or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventually death. While the exact cause remains unknown, certain strategies may help manage the disease:

1\. **Hormonal Support**: Supplement with melatonin and vitamin K2. Consider natural B vitamins and pregnenolone to support progesterone production.

2\. **Infrared Therapy**: This therapy may increase melatonin levels.

3\. **Resveratrol**: Helps decrease toxicity in the body.

These approaches, while not a cure, may provide some relief and support for individuals with ALS.
