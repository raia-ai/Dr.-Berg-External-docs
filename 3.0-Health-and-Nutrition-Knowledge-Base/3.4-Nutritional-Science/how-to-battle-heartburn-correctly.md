# How to battle heartburn correctly?

To effectively manage heartburn, it's essential to address the underlying cause rather than rely solely on temporary solutions like antacids, which may exacerbate the issue by further reducing stomach acid and increasing susceptibility to infections, particularly H. pylori. Research suggests that an imbalance in stomach acid, rather than excess, often contributes to symptoms. Zinc carnosine has been shown to support healthy acid levels, protect the stomach lining, and combat H. pylori. A recommended dosage is 75 mg of zinc carnosine twice daily for ulcer relief. However, consult a healthcare professional before making any changes to your health regimen.
