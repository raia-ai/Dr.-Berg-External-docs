# What are the most effective approaches for alleviating muscle cramps, and how can one address potential underlying causes to achieve long-term relief?

To relieve cramps, increase your intake of magnesium and potassium, as these minerals are essential for muscle relaxation. Sometimes combining magnesium with calcium can enhance the contraction-relaxation cycle. Many find this especially helpful before their menstrual period. Often, cramps occur due to a subclinical magnesium deficiency, which becomes more pronounced during the menstrual cycle. Addressing this can effectively alleviate cramps.
