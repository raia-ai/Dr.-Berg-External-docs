# What are the unusual symptoms and signs of an iodine deficiency?

Many people have low iodine. You're likely iodine deficient unless you consume shellfish, seaweed, sea kelp, or vegetables grown on the coast. The level of iodine in your body really depends on the level of iodine in the food you eat and the soil it's grown in. If you're deficient in iodine, you could end up with a hypothyroid condition.

**Overlooked signs of an iodine deficiency:**

1\. Estrogen dominance. Iodine helps regulate estrogen and helps prevent estrogen dominance. It also supports detoxification.

2\. High cortisol levels. Iodine helps normalize cortisol levels.

3\. A hypothyroid condition. Hypothyroidism can cause the cholesterol in your body to be elevated but unusable for making vitamin D, cell membranes, and bile.

4\. Side effects when consuming soy products. Iodine helps buffer the estrogen effects of consuming soy products.

5\. Hashimoto's. You still need iodine if you have Hashimoto's, but not excess iodine. You may also need selenium, zinc, vitamin D, and myo-inositol.
