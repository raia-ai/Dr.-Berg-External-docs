# Do low fat diets cause gallstones?

## **The Myth of Low-Fat Diets and Gallstones**

Contrary to the misconception that a low-fat diet can ward off gallstones, it is [bile deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-know-if-you-have-bile-deficiency) caused by high insulin levels or other factors like high estrogen, birth control pills, and pregnancy, which is responsible for their formation.

Fats are crucial in triggering bile release, which helps dissolve gallstones.

### **The Role of Fats in Bile Release**

Fats are not the enemy when [preventing gallstones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-low-fat-diet-to-prevent-gallstones-myth); they're our allies. Consuming fatty foods triggers our body to produce bile and discharge it into the small intestine, assisting in breaking down these fats for digestion.

This process keeps your bile flowing regularly, reducing the risk of gallstone formation. So, eating less fat could increase your chances of developing gallstones because it reduces the need for regular bile release.

### **How High Insulin Levels Deplete Bile**

In addition to fat consumption playing a crucial role in maintaining healthy bile flow, another important factor is keeping insulin levels under control.

High insulin levels can deplete your body's supply of stored bile salts needed for adequate digestion and absorption of dietary fats.

Consuming large amounts of sugar or refined carbohydrates can cause spikes in blood sugar levels, leading to increased insulin production - setting off a chain reaction that ultimately leads to depleted reserves of vital digestive enzymes like bile acids.
