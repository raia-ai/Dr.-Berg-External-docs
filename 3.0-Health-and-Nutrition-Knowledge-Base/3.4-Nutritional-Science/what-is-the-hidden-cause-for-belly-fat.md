# What is the hidden cause for belly fat?

If you undergo a lot of stress, whether mental or physical, without being able to recover efficiently that can cause belly fat. This is because your adrenals (stress regulating glands) produce cortisol to help with stress. Cortisol can break down your muscles and store it as fat in your belly and glutes.

The solution is to support your adrenals and address your stress directly. Those can normalize the level of cortisol (not too low and not too high). Additionally, improving your sleep is going to be very beneficial for your adrenals and fat burning.
