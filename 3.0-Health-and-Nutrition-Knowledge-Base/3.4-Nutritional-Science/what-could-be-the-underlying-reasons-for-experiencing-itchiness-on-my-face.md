# What could be the underlying reasons for experiencing itchiness on my face?

Pruritus is the medical term for itchiness, and there can be several underlying causes. One possibility is an issue with bile flow, where bile ducts become backed up, leading to the accumulation of bile salts in the bloodstream and subsequently causing skin irritation. In such cases, a supplement called TUDCA may help alleviate the problem.

Another potential cause of facial itchiness is an imbalance in the skin's microbial flora. Over-cleansing or using harsh detergents and soaps can disrupt the skin's microbiome, leading to irritation, rashes, or itchiness. It's important to approach skin cleansing gently and avoid excessive use of products that can compromise the skin's natural balance.
