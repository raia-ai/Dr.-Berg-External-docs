# What are some healthy foods I need in my diet?

Food is defined as that which is eaten to sustain life, provide energy, and promote the growth and repair of tissues.

By this definition, everything we eat should not be defined as food! Ultra-processed foods do not sustain life, provide energy, or promote the growth of tissues. Ultra-processed foods, also known as junk foods, create the most disease.

Ultra-processed foods can be described as foods that have been altered in an extreme way, either chemically, mechanically, or with heat. These “foods” should be completely eliminated from the diet. Foods like Doritos are packed full of chemically altered GMO ingredients. They contain large amounts of unsaturated fatty acids and are shelf-stable for long periods of time.

Ultra-processed foods often contain three main ingredients: synthetic sugars, synthetic starches, and synthetic seed oils. Avoid these ingredients.

**Here are the 8 healthiest foods:**

1\. Red meat–Grass-fed, grass-finished beef is excellent for your health and is one of the highest sources of glutamine.

2\. Wild-caught fatty fish–Salmon and other fatty fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids.

3\. Shellfish–Shrimp, clams, mussels, and other shellfish contain omega-3s, but they’re also a rich source of trace minerals. Oysters are one of the best sources of zinc.

4\. Eggs–Choose organic pasture-raised eggs.

5\. Fermented vegetables–Sauerkraut and kimchi are excellent sources of probiotics and vitamin C.

6\. Leafy greens–Arugula, spinach, and high-quality lettuce contain folate, vitamin C, magnesium, and potassium. Consuming dairy with spinach can reduce oxalates.

7\. Organ meats–Beef liver, cod liver, and other organ meats are rich in many vitamins, minerals, and trace minerals.

8\. Herbs and spices–Garlic, onion, sage, thyme, sea salt, basil, and cinnamon all have unique properties and important health benefits.
