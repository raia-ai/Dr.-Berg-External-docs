# The Truth About This "Healthy" Food

It's true that gluten can be problematic, but it's not the only protein humans struggle to digest. And while excessive gluten intake can contribute to gut inflammation, it's important to remember that **"gluten-free" doesn't automatically equal "healthy."**

Many processed gluten-free foods are packed with refined sugars, starches, and unhealthy seed oils, which can be just as damaging to your gut as gluten. These ingredients feed harmful bacteria, leading to imbalances that can trigger inflammation throughout the body and contribute to issues like fatty liver and skin problems.

Furthermore, the process of removing gluten from grains often involves harsh chemicals and results in a highly refined product that lacks essential nutrients. This can lead to overeating, nutrient deficiencies, and further gut imbalances like SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) and leaky gut.

Since gut health is closely linked to mental well-being, these issues can also manifest as mood swings, low energy, anxiety, and depression.

**Instead of relying on processed gluten-free products, prioritize whole foods like:**

- **Meat and poultry:** Excellent sources of protein and nutrients.

- **Vegetables:** Provide fiber and essential vitamins and minerals.

- **Healthy fats:** Avocado, olive oil, coconut oil, etc., support gut health.

**If you find that certain vegetables worsen your gut symptoms, you could explore approaches like the carnivore diet temporarily to help reduce inflammation and identify trigger foods.**

**Remember to always read ingredient labels carefully and choose whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible.**
