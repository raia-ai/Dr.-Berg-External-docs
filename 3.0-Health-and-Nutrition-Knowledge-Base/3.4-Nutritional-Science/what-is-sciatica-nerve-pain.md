# What is sciatica nerve pain?

Sciatica is a condition that causes discomfort along the sciatic nerve, which runs from your lower back to your foot. This nerve is the longest and largest in your body, so when it's affected, it can cause some severe problems.

Sciatica is typically caused by pressure on the sciatic nerve, possibly due to a herniated disc, bone spur, or other spinal conditions.

### **How does sciatica affect daily life?**

Sitting, standing, walking, or even bending can be difficult and cause discomfort due to sciatica. In severe cases, it can even lead to loss of bowel or bladder control.

When dealing with sciatica, taking care of your overall health is important. Eating foods high in essential nutrients like riboflavin (vitamin B2) can help prevent deficiencies and promote better health outcomes.
