# What are the symptoms associated with subclinical scurvy, and how do they differ from those of more advanced vitamin C deficiency?

Scurvy is a severe vitamin C deficiency. When it’s classified as subclinical, that means it doesn't show up on a typical blood test because it’s still developing. Another term for this is latent scurvy.

**Here are some of the symptoms of scurvy:**

•Capillary damage

•Fatigue

•Bleeding gums

•Weakness

•Irritability

•Leg pain

•Inflammation

•Achy joints and muscles

Your vascular system is most susceptible to vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C keeps the collagen in your arteries strong and elastic. Without enough vitamin C, your arteries can develop lesions and lose their vascular integrity. Capillary damage occurs when you have high levels of sugar in your blood. Sugar competes with the vitamin C in your body, causing vitamin C levels to drop. When you have capillary damage, arterial bleeding, and inflammation, your body sends cholesterol and calcium to repair the damage.

This can also happen in your skin, resulting in rosacea. You can also develop bleeding gums, a nosebleed, or experience damage to your nerves. In addition to vitamin C, vitamin B1(thiamine) can help protect your body from high levels of sugar in your blood.
