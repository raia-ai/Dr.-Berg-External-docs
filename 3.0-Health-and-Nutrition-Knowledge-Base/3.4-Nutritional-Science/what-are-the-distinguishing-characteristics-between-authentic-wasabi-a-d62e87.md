# What are the distinguishing characteristics between authentic wasabi and its imitation counterparts, and which variant offers superior culinary or health benefits?

Wasabi is a plant that has various phytonutrients (healthy substances found in plants). It is usually added to foods as a spice. Its “hot” taste is similar to hot mustard or horseradish rather than being like chili peppers.

**Benefits**

- May have anticancer effects

- Has potent antimicrobial properties

- Can support the cardiovascular system

- Can support the respiratory system

- Has anti-inflammatory effects

- A powerful antioxidant

- Can help thin mucus

**Where to get it**

True wasabi is very hard to grow and is very expensive. Most wasabi available unfortunately is fake. You can get it at a health food store or order it online, but there is no guarantee that it would be true, original wasabi.
