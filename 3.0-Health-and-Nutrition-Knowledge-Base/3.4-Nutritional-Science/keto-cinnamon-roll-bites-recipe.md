**Low-carb Cinnamon Roll Bites**

**Ingredients:**

This is a small batch recipe that will yield about 8 roll bites.

- 1 scoop vanilla protein powder (I recommend pea protein/Stevie blend.)

- ½ tsp baking powder

- 1 tbl coconut flour

- ½ tsp cinnamon

- 1 tbl powdered sugar-free sweetener of choice

- 1 large egg

- ¼ cup unsweetened almond milk

- ¼ tsp vanilla extract

**Directions:**

Mix all dry ingredients together. Beat egg. Add vanilla and milk and mix well. Add wet ingredients to dry and mix well with a wooden spoon, until well-blended.

Spray the mini muffin pan or use paper muffin cups. Put one heaping teaspoon of batter into each well/cup. Bake at 350 for 13 minutes (or until a toothpick is clean when pulled from roll). Remove carefully from the pan and cool on a rack.

For a sweeter, more traditional cinnamon roll, you can mix a tsp of sugar alternative fine powder sweetener like "Just Like Sugar for Baking," with 2 tsp melted coconut oil or butter, and a pinch of cinnamon or as desired. Mix and drizzle over roll when fully cooled.
