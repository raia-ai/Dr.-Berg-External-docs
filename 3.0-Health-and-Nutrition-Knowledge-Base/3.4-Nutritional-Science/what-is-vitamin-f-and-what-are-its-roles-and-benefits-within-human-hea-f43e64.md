# What is Vitamin F, and what are its roles and benefits within human health and nutrition?

Vitamin F is no longer considered a vitamin because it doesn’t fit the traditional definition of
a vitamin. Vitamin F is the combination of two essential fatty acids. Essential fatty acids are fats that must come from your diet—your body can’t make them. Vitamin F is ALA (alpha-linoleic acid), an omega-3 fatty acid, and LA (linoleic acid), an omega-6 fatty acid.

Every single organ in your body needs these two essential fatty acids. They help you absorb calcium, build cell structures, maintain cell flexibility and grow cells.
