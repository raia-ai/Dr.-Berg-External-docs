# What common factors or habits might be preventing my metabolism from increasing?

Here are the top mistakes dieters make:

1\. Misunderstanding Metabolism: Trying to boost metabolism can lead to burnout. A slower metabolism often reflects efficiency rather than dysfunction.

2\. Low-Calorie Diets: Long-term low-calorie diets can hinder metabolism and lead to weight regain.

3\. Frequent Eating: Eating frequently can spike insulin levels, hindering fat burning. Opt for quality over quantity in meals.

4\. Overtraining: Excessive exercise without adequate recovery prevents effective fat burning.

5\. Processed Protein Shakes: Low-quality protein shakes high in refined ingredients and insulin-raising factors can hinder weight loss. Opt for high-quality animal proteins instead.

Focus on improving overall health to facilitate sustainable weight loss, including adopting a ketogenic diet to shift to fat metabolism and incorporating high-intensity interval training with adequate recovery, while managing stress and prioritizing sleep.
