# What are the underlying causes of scoliosis, kyphosis, and lordosis?

Scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis are abnormal curves of your spine that can cause a lot of difficulties and pain, especially in your back.

**Symptoms:**

- Scoliosis: s-curve of the spine

- Kyphosis: hunched back

- Lordosis: lower back curved too far in

**Cause #1: Vitamin D deficiency**

Vitamin D has a lot to do with your skeletal structure as well as with bone health. If you are deficient in vitamin D this can cause scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis--along with other problems.

Vitamin D increases the absorption of calcium by 20 times. Also consuming vitamin K2 will increase the movement of free calcium in the blood to the needed tissues and bones.
