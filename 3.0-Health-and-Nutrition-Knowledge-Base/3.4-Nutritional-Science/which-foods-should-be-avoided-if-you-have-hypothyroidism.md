# Which foods should be avoided if you have hypothyroidism?

**Understanding Goitrogens and Hypothyroidism**

Goitrogens are substances that can interfere with thyroid function and potentially lead to a goiter (enlarged thyroid). This is especially important to note if you have hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid).

**Foods to Limit or Avoid:**

- **Cruciferous vegetables:** Broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, etc. (Small amounts cooked/steamed may be okay.)

- **Soy products:** Tofu, tempeh, edamame

- **Cassava, lima beans, sorghum, sweet potatoes, flax seeds, millet**

- **Onions**

- **Gluten** (especially if you have a sensitivity or intolerance)

**Important Notes:**

- Cooking cruciferous vegetables can reduce their goitrogenic effects.

- Sea kelp may lessen the impact of goitrogens.

- Avoid foods that deplete selenium, iodine, iron, and vitamin A, as these nutrients are important for thyroid health.

**Foods for Thyroid Health:**

- **Selenium and Iodine:** Seafood, sea kelp, sea salt

- **Iron:** Red meat, animal products

- **Vitamin A:** Egg yolks, butter, cod liver oil, beef liver
