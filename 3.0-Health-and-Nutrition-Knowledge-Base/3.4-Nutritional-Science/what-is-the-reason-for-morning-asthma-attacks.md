# What is the reason for morning asthma attacks?

The correlation between magnesium deficiency and increased asthma attacks in the morning:

1. **Magnesium's Role in Airway Function:** Magnesium acts as a natural bronchodilator, helping to relax the muscles in the airways and improve airflow. When magnesium levels are low, the airways become more constricted, increasing the likelihood of asthma attacks.  

2. **Circadian Rhythm of Magnesium:** Magnesium levels naturally dip in the morning. This coincides with the time when asthma symptoms often worsen, potentially due to factors like increased airway resistance and inflammation overnight. Low magnesium levels in the morning can further exacerbate these issues, triggering or intensifying asthma attacks.

3. **Inflammation:** Magnesium also has anti-inflammatory effects. Deficiency can lead to increased inflammation in the airways, making them more sensitive and reactive, further contributing to asthma attacks.  

Please consult your medical professional on the deficiency of magnesium and asthma.
