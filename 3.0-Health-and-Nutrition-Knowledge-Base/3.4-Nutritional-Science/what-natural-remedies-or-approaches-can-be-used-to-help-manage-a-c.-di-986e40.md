# What natural remedies or approaches can be used to help manage a C. diff infection?

To address C. diff naturally, start by taking a potent probiotic and consider doubling the dosage. Incorporate at least one cup of raw sauerkraut into your daily diet. Additionally, after dinner, consume a cup of plain, unsweetened kefir. If possible, opt for kefir made from goat's or sheep's milk, though any kefir will provide beneficial microbes. This combination can help restore a healthy balance of gut bacteria.
