# Are insects a viable source of protein?

The idea of eating insects by 2050 due to population growth and sustainability concerns is debated. While insects are rich in protein, fat, and carbs, the quantity needed to meet dietary needs could be costly and less nutritious if feeding practices are compromised.

Comparatively, insects fall short of beef in protein and nutritional value. They also carry potential pathogens; studies show high rates of parasites and pathogenic bacteria among edible cricket farms. Additionally, those allergic to shellfish may react to insects due to similar proteins. Chitin in insect exoskeletons acts as an antinutrient, blocking absorption of vitamins A and E.
