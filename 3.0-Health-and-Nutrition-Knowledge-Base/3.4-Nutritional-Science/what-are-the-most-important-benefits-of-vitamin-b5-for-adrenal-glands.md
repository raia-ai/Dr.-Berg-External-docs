# What are the most important benefits of vitamin B5 for adrenal glands?

Vitamin B5 is essential for the adrenals, as it helps with synthesizing acetylcholine, cortisol, epinephrine, serotonin, and melatonin. It plays a key role in producing stress hormones and regulating sleep and mood. Vitamin B5 supports cells controlling the circadian rhythm and helps balance cortisol levels, which is crucial for good sleep.

Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) can be taken as a supplement, but pantethine, an active form, may be more effective. For adrenal or sleep issues, taking 500 to 1,000 mg of vitamin B5 can help lower cortisol and improve sleep.
