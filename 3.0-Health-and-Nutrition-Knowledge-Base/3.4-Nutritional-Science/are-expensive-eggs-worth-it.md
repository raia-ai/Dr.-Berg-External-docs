# Are expensive eggs worth it?

**Chicken Egg Sourcing: A Quick Overview**

**Space Requirements:**

\- **Caged Chickens:** Typically have around 67 square inches (about 8x8 inches) per bird.

\- **Cage-Free Chickens:** Confined to a barn with approximately one square foot of space per bird.

\- **Free-Range Chickens:** Given about 2 square feet of space, with potential outdoor access.

\- **Pasture-Raised Chickens:** Provided 10x10 feet of outdoor space.

**Health Implications:**

\- **Limited Space:** Increases stress hormones in chickens, negatively impacting egg quality.

\- **Conventional Feed:** Often includes GMO corn and soy, leading to high omega-6 fatty acids in eggs, which can contribute to inflammation and affect overall health.

**Best Choice:**

\- **Organic Pasture-Raised Eggs:** Although pricier, these eggs are a healthier option due to better living conditions and feed.
