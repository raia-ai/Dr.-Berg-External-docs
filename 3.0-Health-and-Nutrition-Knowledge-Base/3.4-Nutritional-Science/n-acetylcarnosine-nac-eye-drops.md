# N-acetylcarnosine (NAC) Eye Drops

While Dr. Berg Nutritionals does not sell N-acetylcarnosine (NAC), we are happy to provide educational information about the amino acid. When purchasing NAC, consider reputable sellers with positive customer feedback. Always thoroughly research potential suppliers for any supplements.

**NAC and Eye Health**

- **L-carnosine:** This potent antioxidant supports mitochondrial function, counteracts glycation (a damaging sugar-protein reaction), and helps regulate pH levels. While excellent for overall health, L-carnosine alone cannot easily reach eye tissues.

- **N-acetylcarnosine (NAC):** This form enables carnosine to penetrate the eye. Research suggests a 1% NAC solution, used 1-2 drops, 2-3 times daily, may benefit conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration.

- **Zinc's Role:** This essential mineral is both an antioxidant and crucial for optimal NAC utilization in the body. Consider supplementing NAC alongside zinc.

**Cataracts: Causes and Prevention**

- **What are Cataracts?** Clouding of the eye's lens is a leading cause of blindness. Surgery is the usual treatment, but prevention is key.

- **Oxidative Stress:** This imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants can contribute to cataract formation. Excess sugar consumption is a significant driver of oxidative stress in the eyes.

- **The Sorbitol Problem:** This sugar alcohol promotes inflammation and glycation, which is particularly harmful within the eye. Sorbitol can harm the retina and nerve tissue and contribute to glaucoma risk.

- **Prevention is Key:** If you have cataracts, a sugar-free diet is essential to help reverse damage.
