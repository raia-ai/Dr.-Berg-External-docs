# What mechanisms might explain why consuming red meat could lead to a worsening of symptoms or discomfort in some individuals?

**First, you may not have enough hydrochloric acid in your stomach to digest the protein. This is a common problem, and it’s easy to fix. All you need to do is to take some betaine hydrochloride and apple cider vinegar capsules. This will help increase your stomach’s acidity so you can properly digest red meat. Many people have this problem as they get older.**

The second issue that you may be accumulating too much iron. While iron is essential for a healthy body, too much can be a problem. The thing is, our bodies don’t have a natural mechanism to get rid of iron. So if you have too much, you can develop some problems, including liver issues, headaches, joint pain, fatigue, and insomnia.
