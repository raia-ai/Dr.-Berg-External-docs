# What exercises do you recommend for love handles?

Love handles result from fat accumulation in the liver that spills off in and around the organs in your mid-section.

The primary cause of love handles is a diet that’s high in sugar and refined carbs. Sugar and refined carbs cause high insulin, which causes stored fat. But, stress and a lack of sleep also cause high insulin and lead to love handle.
