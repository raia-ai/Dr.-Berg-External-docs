# What are the indicators of healthy eggs?

For optimal health benefits, focus on how hens are raised and fed rather than egg color.

Pasture-Raised Eggs: Hens are free to roam outdoors and forage, leading to eggs rich in vitamins D and E and omega-3 fatty acids.

Pasteurized Eggs: Hens are typically confined indoors with a grain-based diet, resulting in lower nutrient levels.

Organic Eggs: Hens are fed without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers and have outdoor access, ensuring fewer chemicals.

Vegetarian-Fed Eggs: Hens are fed a plant-based diet, but without the "organic" label, they may still consume GMO feed and miss out on the benefits of a varied diet.
