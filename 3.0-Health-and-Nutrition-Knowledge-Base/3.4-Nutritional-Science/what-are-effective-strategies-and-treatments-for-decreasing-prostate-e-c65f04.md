# What are effective strategies and treatments for decreasing prostate enlargement, and how can they help manage symptoms and improve overall prostate health?

To address prostate enlargement, consider the following measures:

1\. **Limit Dairy Intake**: Dairy products can contain hormones that may negatively impact prostate health. Reducing dairy consumption may be beneficial.

2\. **Avoid Estrogenic Foods**: Steer clear of estrogenic substances, such as soy, which may influence prostate growth.

3\. **Manage Insulin Levels**: Reduce carbohydrate intake to lower insulin levels. High insulin levels can contribute to prostate enlargement due to its anabolic effects.
