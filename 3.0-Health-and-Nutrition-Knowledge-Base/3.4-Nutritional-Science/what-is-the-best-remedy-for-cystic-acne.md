# What is the best remedy for cystic acne?

Two main causes of hormonal cystic acne:

1\. PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) This is a condition where you're making too much testosterone. High levels of insulin could potentially cause this condition.

2\. Too much 5-alpha reductase This is an enzyme that converts testosterone into a very powerful form of testosterone called DHT, which is causing acne. A natural 5-alpha reductase inhibitor may help. Natural 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are in cruciferous foods. There is also a concentrated form of cruciferous called DIM that may be beneficial as well.
