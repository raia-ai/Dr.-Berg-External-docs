# What strategies or interventions can assist someone struggling with excessive carbohydrate consumption?

Carboholic is someone that is addicted to carbohydrates. This is a physical problem and a cellular level where the body is driving you to not think about the future consequences, logically it doesn’t help you to understand that.

Insulin is the hormone that allows the sugar fuel into the cell, which could lead to insulin resistance where the insulin doesn’t work anymore and that makes your body crave sugar.

Every time you consume sugar there is a spike of beta-endorphins, which is the chemicals in the body that are 30x stronger than morphine for pain and stress.

Dopamine which is a pleasure hormone that is stimulated when you take drugs is also triggered when you consume a lot of sugar and carbohydrates.

**The difference between addiction and a habit:**

• Addiction: Completely out of control and cannot say no. The more you can’t have it, the more you want it.

• Habit: Something that you can say no to. It is just like a routine you get into.

**Ways to Overcome Addiction to Carbs:**

1\. Understand what is happening in the body

2\. Heal insulin resistance

3\. Do things gradually: Start consuming keto bombs (sweet cookies that do not affect insulin)

4\. Start consuming a lot of nutrients – It is the nutrients that protect the cell against high levels of sugar
