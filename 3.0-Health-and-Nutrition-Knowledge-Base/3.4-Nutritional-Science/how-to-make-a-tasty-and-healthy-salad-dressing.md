# How to make a tasty and healthy salad dressing?

It’s difficult to find healthy salad dressings at the store that don’t contain sugar or oils high in omega-6 fatty acids. The salad dressings I’m going to share have unique health benefits. Of course, salad has a lot of important benefits, but choosing the right salad dressing can take it to the next level.

Here’s how to make salad dressing at home. You will use a simple base of extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and apple cider vinegar for each of these salad dressings.

Add this base to a 16-ounce jar and keep it in your refrigerator. Each time you have a salad, add a quarter cup to half a cup of this base to a bowl, add your spices, mix it up, and pour it on your salad.

**Ingredients for the salad dressing base:**

1/3 cup (2.5 ounces) extra virgin olive oil

1/4 cup (2 ounces) apple cider vinegar

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) lemon juice
