# How does Big Pharma profit off of sick people?

There are over 100 clinical trials supporting that type 2 diabetes can be reversed in as little as 10 weeks. Hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and other chronic diseases can potentially also be reversed with dietary changes. The reversal rate of type 2 diabetes with the standard of care from doctors is 0.1%. In clinical trials with patients following a keto diet, the reversal rate is more than 50%!

Insulin manufacturers and other drug companies primarily fund the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association, so they are subject to direct conflicts of interest. Doctors have been taught to recommend low-fat diets, and there are countless baseless claims that keto is dangerous.

Dietary guidelines significantly influence most Americans. By law, all federal food programs are required to follow these guidelines. Health professionals also use them as the gold standard in nutrition. However, many conflicts of interest are involved in these guidelines, including ties to both Big Food and Big Pharma.

Giving accurate dietary guidelines to the American public is the best way to combat chronic disease.

To get into a healthy state of ketosis, you should eat eggs, dairy, meat, shellfish, vegetables, and low-sugar fruits. Carbohydrates trigger hunger. Without glucose, your body can access your fat stores for energy between meals.
