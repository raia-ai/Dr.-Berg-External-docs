# How to start eating healthy?

If you can't stick to a healthy eating plan or a diet, then you need to do these 4 things:

1\. Decide that enough is enough

2\. Realize your body is stupid and won't give you correct answers.

3\. Reduce the physical body cravings

4\. Plan your meals - don't just go from one meal to the next.
