# How can I fix the deficiencies behind the vertical ridges on my fingernails?

Most of your biotin is made by your microbes, so a history of antibiotic use can contribute to biotin deficiency. Biotin deficiency symptoms include brittle hair, thin nails, neurological problems, and peripheral neuropathy. Biotin, zinc, and iron control collagen. A deficiency in either of these nutrients can cause vertical lines on the nails.

Once you identify which nutrient you are most likely deficient in, you can increase your intake of certain foods or supplements to fix the problem.

Grass-fed liver pills or spleen extract pills are the best option for an iron deficiency.

To increase zinc, consume more shellfish, oysters, and grass-fed beef. If you choose to take a supplement for zinc, take 50 grams in a blend with other trace minerals, including copper.

If you have a biotin deficiency, try increasing your biotin with a supplement. Take a good probiotic to support gut health, which will naturally help increase biotin.
