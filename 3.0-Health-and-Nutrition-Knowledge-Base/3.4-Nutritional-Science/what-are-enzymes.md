# What are enzymes?

Enzymes are like tiny little worker bees in your body. They do the work of breaking down carbohydrates, fats, proteins and other raw nutrients.

When you have a meal, you trigger the release of enzymes. Your body tells your pancreas what types of enzymes to release based on the kinds of nutrients you have ingested. Specific enzymes break down specific nutrients.
