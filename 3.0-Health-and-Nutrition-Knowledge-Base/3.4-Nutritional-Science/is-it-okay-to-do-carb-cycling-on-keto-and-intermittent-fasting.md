# Is it okay to do carb cycling on keto and intermittent fasting?

Avoid carb cycling on keto and intermittent fasting. Consuming refined carbs disrupts ketosis, switching your body to sugar burning.

People often crave carbs because of low blood sugar and energy. However, incorporating carbs blocks keto, which relies on very low carb intake.

With proper adaptation, you'll transition to fat burning efficiently, maintaining high endurance and stable performance. Aim to build a strong health reserve so occasional deviations from keto have minimal impact.
