# What strategies can be employed to relieve joint stiffness during menopause?

To relieve stiff joints during menopause, consider the following professional advice:

1\. Ketogenic Diet: Adopt a ketogenic diet to reduce inflammation by increasing ketone levels and reducing glucose. Avoid grains and sugars to minimize inflammatory responses.

2\. Oxalate Intake: Be mindful of high-oxalate foods like spinach, chocolate, almonds, and nuts, which can contribute to joint stiffness even on a ketogenic diet.

3\. Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Ensure sufficient intake of omega-3 fatty acids by consuming more fish, sardines, and seafood, which are essential for joint health and reducing inflammation.

These steps can help alleviate joint stiffness and improve overall well-being during menopause.
