**Bioperine® (black pepper extract) (Piper nigrum) (standardized to contain 95% piperine)** 

Bioperine® is a standardized extract of black pepper that contains 95% piperine, the active compound responsible for many of black pepper's health benefits. Here's how Bioperine® benefits you when combined with ashwagandha:
