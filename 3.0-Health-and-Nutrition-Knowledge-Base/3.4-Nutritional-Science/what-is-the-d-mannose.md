# What is the D-Mannose?

D-mannose is a type of sugar that will not affect your glucose levels and doesn’t get stored as a glycogen. It is really good for a UTI (urinary tract infection). The urinary system includes the kidneys, renal pelvis, ureters, bladder and urethra. If there is an infection in the urinary tract it can create pain and an urge to urinate even when the bladder is empty.

**How to consume it**

Follow the direction on the label for the proper dosage.

D-mannose attaches to the microbe called E. coli (which is involved in 90% of UTI cases) and takes it out of the system. (If it doesn’t work, that could mean that you have different types of microbes, fungus, or bacterias in your urinary tract. In such cases, use oregano oil.)

**Where to get it**

You can get it at the health food store or order it online.
