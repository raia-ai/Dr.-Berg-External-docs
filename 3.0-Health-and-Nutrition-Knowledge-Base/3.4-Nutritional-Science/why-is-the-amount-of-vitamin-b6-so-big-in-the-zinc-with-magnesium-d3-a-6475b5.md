# Why is the amount of vitamin B6 so big in the Zinc with Magnesium, D3 and Selenium?

Dr. Berg included 10mg of vitamin B6 in our Zinc with Magnesium formula because many people are deficient in this essential nutrient.

Factors that can contribute to B6 deficiency include:

Consuming a diet high in processed foods

Use of certain medications like diuretics, blood pressure medications, antibiotics, and birth control pills. Lifestyle factors like alcohol consumption, smoking, and exposure to herbicides

Vitamin B6 plays a vital role in supporting overall health and supplementing it can help address potential deficiencies. It's generally safe to take up to 200mg of vitamin B6 daily without experiencing side effects.
