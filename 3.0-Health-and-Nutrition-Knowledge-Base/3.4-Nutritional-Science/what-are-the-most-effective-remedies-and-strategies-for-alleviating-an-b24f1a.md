# What are the most effective remedies and strategies for alleviating and managing bloating?

The #1 remedy for bloating: activated charcoal. Using activated charcoal also happens to be one of the best ways to detox.

**Activated charcoal can help with a range of issues, including:**

• Bloating

• Gas

• Belching

• Nausea

• Diarrhea

• Headaches

• Food poisoning

• Stomach acidity

• Detox reaction

• Bad breath

Activated charcoal is different from the charcoal used in a grill. You can find activated charcoal in a health food store, and it’s been used as a natural remedy for a long time. Activated charcoal binds to things like toxins and helps remove them. It’s important to remember that this remedy for digestive issues like bloating is only helping you with a symptom. It’s helping you in a natural way, which is fantastic, but it’s not getting to the root cause.

There is usually an underlying cause leading to symptoms like bloating. But, while you work to identify the root cause, activated charcoal may be a beneficial natural remedy to use.
