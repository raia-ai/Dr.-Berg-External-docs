# Can I use chick peas to make Natto?

Yes, you can use chickpeas (garbanzos) to make natto! While traditionally made with soybeans, natto can be made with other beans, including chickpeas.

Here's why it works:

**Fermentation Process:** Natto relies on the bacteria *Bacillus subtilis* to ferment the beans. This bacteria isn't exclusive to soybeans and can ferment other legumes like chickpeas

**Similar Nutritional Profile:** Chickpeas offer a comparable nutritional profile to soybeans, providing a good source of protein and fiber.

However, there are a few things to keep in mind:

**Texture:** Chickpea natto might have a slightly different texture than traditional soybean natto. It may be a bit firmer and less sticky.

**Taste:** The flavor might also be subtly different, with a slightly nuttier taste from the chickpeas.
