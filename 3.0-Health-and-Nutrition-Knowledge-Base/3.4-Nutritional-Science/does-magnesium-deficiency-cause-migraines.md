# Does magnesium deficiency cause migraines?

The link between magnesium levels and migraines in the morning is supported by research suggesting that:

**Magnesium Deficiency and Migraines:** Studies have shown a correlation between low magnesium levels and an increased frequency and severity of migraines.

- Magnesium plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter regulation, blood vessel tone, and nerve function, all of which are implicated in migraine development.  

- **Circadian Rhythm of Magnesium:** Magnesium levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day, being lowest in the morning. This dip in magnesium can trigger migraines in susceptible individuals, explaining why migraines are often more frequent in the morning hours.  

- **Magnesium's Mechanisms in Migraine Prevention:** Magnesium is believed to work in several ways to prevent migraines, including:

    - Regulating neurotransmitter release, such as glutamate, which can trigger migraines.

    - Preventing blood vessel constriction in the brain, which can contribute to migraine pain.  

    - Reducing inflammation, which plays a role in migraine development.  

However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional if you are experiencing migraines before starting any new supplements, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.
