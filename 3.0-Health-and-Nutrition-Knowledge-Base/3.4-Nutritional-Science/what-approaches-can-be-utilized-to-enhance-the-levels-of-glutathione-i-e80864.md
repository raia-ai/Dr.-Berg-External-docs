# What approaches can be utilized to enhance the levels of glutathione in the body?

Glutathione is the most abundant antioxidant in the liver, but all of the cells make it. It reduces oxidative stress. Glutathione can help neutralize toxins that your body actually makes for various things. Glutathione also helps maintain exogenous antioxidants like vitamin C, and vitamin E. It not only acts as an antioxidant, but it also helps in detoxification. Because glutathione is sulfur, when you eat certain foods high in sulfur, you will give your body the raw material it needs to make more glutathione.

**How to boost glutathione naturally:**

• Sulfur-based vegetables (cruciferous vegetables)

• Vitamin C

• Selenium

• Milk thistle

• Fasting

**What decreases glutathione?**

• Alcohol

• Stress

• Age

• Drugs

• Toxins
