# What are the physiological and psychological benefits of cold-water immersion, and how does it impact overall health?

To experience these incredible benefits, you only need to do cold-water immersion therapy for eleven minutes per week. You can get the advantages of cold-water immersion by using a special cold-water immersion tank, a cold shower, a cold pool, or a cold body of water.
