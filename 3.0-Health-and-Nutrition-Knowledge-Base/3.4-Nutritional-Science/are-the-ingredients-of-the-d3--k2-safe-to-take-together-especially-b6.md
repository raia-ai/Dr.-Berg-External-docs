# Are the ingredients of the D3 & K2 safe to take together, especially B6?

Many vitamins, minerals, and nutrients are found in nature and regularly consumed together. When consumed together, our bodies can process and utilize nutrients independently and interdependently.

Vitamin B6 and D3 have no known interactions when taken within safe ranges.  The two vitamins have been found to complement one another.
