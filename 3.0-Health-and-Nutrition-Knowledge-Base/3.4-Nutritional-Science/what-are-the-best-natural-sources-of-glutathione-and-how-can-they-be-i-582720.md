# What are the best natural sources of glutathione, and how can they be incorporated into a healthy diet?

**Supporting Glutathione Production Naturally**

To enhance glutathione levels, consider these effective strategies:

\- **Dietary Sources of Glycine**: Glycine is crucial for glutathione synthesis. Key sources include:

\- Bone broth

\- Collagen and gelatin

\- Organ meats (liver, kidney)

\- Poultry skin

\- Red meat

Incorporating these into your diet can support glutathione production.

\- **Methylated Vitamins**: Methylation regulates glutathione production and recycling. Genetic variations like MTHFR mutations can impair this process. Support methylation with bioavailable forms of vitamins, such as:

\- B12 (methylcobalamin)

\- Folate (5-MTHF)

These methylated forms can enhance absorption and bypass genetic limitations. Ensure your supplements include these forms for optimal effectiveness.
