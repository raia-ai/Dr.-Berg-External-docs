# What steps should I take to manage an autoimmune disease, considering treatment options, lifestyle changes, and potential multidisciplinary care?

Autoimmune disease is a condition in which your body is attacking itself.

This means your immune system attacks your body’s own healthy tissues, similar to the body having an allergy to itself. Dr. Royal Lee was a famous nutritionist in the early 20th century. He discovered something known as PMG(proto morphogen), which worked to improve autoimmune disease symptoms.

Dr. Lee took the cells from another species’ thyroid and extracted the DNA using sea salt. He found that the DNA from this thyroid was very similar to ours.

If you consume the PMG (thyroid extract) orally and process it through your stomach, the antibodies that are attacking your thyroid will attack this decoy instead.

This allows you time to deplete the antibody reserve, so you no longer have any destructive attacks on your thyroid. If you have an autoimmune condition, PMGs or a glandular extract for a specific organ can help improve your symptoms over time.
