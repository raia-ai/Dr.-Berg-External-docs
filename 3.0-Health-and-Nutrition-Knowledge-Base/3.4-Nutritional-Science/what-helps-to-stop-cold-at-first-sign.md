# What helps to stop cold at first sign?

First, take zinc and vitamin C together, but eat foods high in vitamin C as opposed to a supplement. I recommend eating lemons, as opposed to pasteurized lemon juice.

You can also drink apple cider vinegar because when you acidify your body with it, you speed up the action of white blood cells called phagocytes. They clean up bacteria as part of your immune system.

Eat garlic. It’s the most powerful anti-viral food I know. It’s also anti-bacterial. Make sure you do these things right when you get the first symptom of a cold.
