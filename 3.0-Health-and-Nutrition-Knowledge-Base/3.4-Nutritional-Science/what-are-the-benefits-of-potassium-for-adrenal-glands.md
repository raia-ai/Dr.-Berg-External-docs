# What are the benefits of potassium for adrenal glands?

**Two types of adrenal problems:**

1\. High adrenals (Cushing's) — A hyper state People with hyper adrenal glands may need much more potassium than salt. They may benefit from a moderate amount of salt and a lot of potassium.

2\. Low adrenals (Addison's) — A hypo state People with Addison's disease may worsen the situation by adding more potassium. Instead, it may be a good idea to add salt.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**
