# Is it safe and beneficial to take niacin daily, and what factors should be considered regarding dosage and potential side effects?

Yes, you can take niacin daily as it has minimal side effects at the recommended dosage and is well-researched for its benefits on cholesterol and lipid profiles. To optimize its effects, consider adding a natural B-complex vitamin. This ensures you maintain a balanced intake of all B vitamins, preventing potential imbalances that might arise from taking a single B vitamin.
