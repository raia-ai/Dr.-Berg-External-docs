# What are the benefits of rice water for hair?

Rice water contains B vitamins and amino acids essential for the hair. Fermented rice water contains pitera, a byproduct of fermentation often used in skin care. Pitera helps brighten the hair and also helps with dandruff and itchiness. Fermented rice water contains lactic acid, which decreases dullness and frizziness. It also contains magnesium and selenium. Fermented rice water increases nitric oxide, which helps bring oxygen to the hair's root.

To make fermented rice water, combine 2 cups of organic rice in a bowl with 4 cups of water. Massage the rice with water and drain. Add 2 cups of water to the wet rice and allow the mixture to sit at room temperature for 2 hours. Strain the liquid into a glass jar and cover lightly. After 48 hours, cover your fermented rice water with a lid and store it in the refrigerator. The cold temperature will slow down bacterial growth. To use fermented rice water for your hair, apply it to your hair and scalp, leave it on for 20 minutes, and then rinse. Do this twice per week for hair growth and healthier hair. Fermented rice water helps repair the hair and puts beneficial microbes back into the hair. It can also be used on your face!
