# Can I do Keto and Intermittent Fasting if I'm a diabetic on metformin and insulin?

Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, both conditions involve high blood sugar and insulin. Metformin makes insulin receptors more responsive, while insulin replaces what the pancreas lacks. In type 1 diabetes, insulin is used to control unstable blood sugars, often resulting in high insulin levels. High insulin is more dangerous than high sugar, as it can damage the retina, kidneys, arteries, and brain. The goal is to minimize insulin use. For type 1 diabetes, despite potentially irreversibly damaged beta cells, it's crucial to reduce insulin use by focusing on diet and intermittent fasting to lower carb intake and improve insulin resistance. Work with your doctor to adjust medications accordingly.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**
