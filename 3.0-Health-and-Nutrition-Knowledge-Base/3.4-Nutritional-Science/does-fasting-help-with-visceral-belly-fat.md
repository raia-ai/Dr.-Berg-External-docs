# Does fasting help with visceral belly fat?

Correct intermittent fasting patterns can target visceral fat. The key lies in maintaining a consistent ketogenic diet in combination with intermittent fasting, unlike patterns such as every-other-day fasting or the 5:2 method, which can slow down weight loss by disrupting the body's fuel adaptation process. For optimal results in targeting belly fat and correcting metabolism, combining keto with intermittent fasting is recommended.
