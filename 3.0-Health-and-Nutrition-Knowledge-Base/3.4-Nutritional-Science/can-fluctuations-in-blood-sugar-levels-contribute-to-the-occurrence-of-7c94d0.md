# Can fluctuations in blood sugar levels contribute to the occurrence of headaches and migraines?

Low blood sugar can trigger headaches and migraines. When you eat carbs, your blood sugar goes up, and your ache may disappear. However this will not resolve the issue because shortly after, your blood sugar will go low again, causing a new headache.

I recommend getting on the Healthy KetoÂ® diet, which will give your body a better type of fuel for your brain: ketones (a byproduct of fat-burning). Ketones will not cause your blood sugar to go up and down. Stable blood sugar may resolve the headache issue.

(Note: If you have just started a keto diet, headaches could be a symptom of adapting to the diet.)
