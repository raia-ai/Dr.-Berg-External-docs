# Do I really need fiber to avoid constipation?

Constipation is congestion in your gut—you have too much stool. Fiber increases stool volume. Fiber also causes your microbes to create fermentation, which leads to gas and bloating. Some studies suggest that consuming fiber can even worsen conditions like chronic constipation or SIBO. The biggest mistake people make when dealing with constipation is consuming more fiber.

How to deal with constipation naturally:

1\. Reduce your fiber

2\. Talk to your doctor about whether or not it’s a side effect of a medication (and what to do if it is)

3\. Consume vitamin B1

4\. Lower your stress

5\. Take bile salts

6\. Take a probiotic

7\. Do intermittent fasting

8\. Consume a moderate amount of protein

9\. Consume betaine hydrochloride and apple cider vinegar

10\. Consume magnesium and potassium
