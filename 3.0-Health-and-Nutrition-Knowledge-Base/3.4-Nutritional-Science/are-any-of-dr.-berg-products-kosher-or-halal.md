# Are any of Dr. Berg products Kosher or Halal?

Dr. Berg Nutritionals offers four Halal-certified products as of January 14th, 2025.

Organic BeetRoot Juice Powder

Chewable Vitamin C Complex

Nutritional Yeast Tablets

Nutritional Yeast Flakes

All other products do not meet Halal or Kosher standards or are still in the certification process. The certification process requires a significant amount of time and resources. Every ingredient must be approved for a product to be certified as Kosher or Halal. Many of our products contain multiple ingredients sourced from various vendors, and these vendors need to have their products certified before we can certify our final product.

The certification process is currently underway, and we appreciate your understanding and patience as we work through it.
