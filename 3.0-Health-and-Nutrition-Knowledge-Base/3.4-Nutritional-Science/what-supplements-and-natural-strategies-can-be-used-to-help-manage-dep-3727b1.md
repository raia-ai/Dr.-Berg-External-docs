# What supplements and natural strategies can be used to help manage depression and bipolar disorder without the use of medication, and how effective are these approaches?

To combat depression and bipolar disorder naturally, consider these steps:

1\. **Diet and Fasting:** Start with a healthy ketogenic diet combined with intermittent fasting. This foundational change can significantly improve your mood and overall well-being.

2\. **Targeted Nutrients:** Once your diet is optimized, supplement with higher amounts of vitamin D, which has been shown to support mental health.

Addressing nutrient deficiencies without first improving your diet may not be effective, so prioritize dietary changes and then adjust with specific supplements as needed.

***We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.***
