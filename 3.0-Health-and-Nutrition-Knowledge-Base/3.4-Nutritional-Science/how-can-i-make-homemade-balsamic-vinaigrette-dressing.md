# How can I make homemade balsamic vinaigrette dressing?

This is an excellent salad dressing that’s keto-friendly and delicious. Most salad dressings are filled with GMO soy, corn oil, sugar, and MSG. Even some of the salad dressings that are advertised as healthy or organic may have some of these things. This is an incredibly easy recipe, it’s super healthy, and I think you’re really going to like it. 

**Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing**

• ¼ cup balsamic vinegar

• ¾ cup olive oil

• 1 tbl chopped garlic

• 1 tbl Dijon mustard

• salt and pepper

• (I suggest adding 2 teaspoons of roasted sesame seeds!)

Mix all ingredients in a jar and shake well. Refrigerate. This will last for several weeks.
