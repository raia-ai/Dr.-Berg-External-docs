# Are you experiencing symptoms of copper deficiency?

Zinc can be beneficial for many different health problems. But, if you take too much zinc (over 40mg) over a period of weeks, this could create a copper deficiency.

Zinc and copper work together. So, it’s always good to take copper when you’re taking zinc to avoid a copper deficiency. You could also take all of the trace minerals together with zinc.

Symptoms of a copper deficiency:

1\. Nausea

2\. Flu-like symptoms (this is due to neutropenia, which is lowered white blood cells)

3\. Anemia (fatigue and weakness)

4\. Stomach pain

5\. Tingling and numbness in the hands or feet

6\. Diarrhea

7\. Loss of skin tone

8\. Vomiting
