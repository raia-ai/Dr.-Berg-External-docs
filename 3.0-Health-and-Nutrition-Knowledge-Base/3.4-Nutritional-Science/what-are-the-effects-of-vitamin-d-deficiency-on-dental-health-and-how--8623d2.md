# What are the effects of vitamin D deficiency on dental health, and how can it impact tooth development, strength, and overall oral hygiene?

This mainly occurs when you’re a baby before your teeth even come in. It’s basically rickets of your teeth. Rickets is a vitamin D deficiency. I believe vitamin D is probably the most important vitamin, and it works with vitamin K2. Vitamin K2 is very important for your teeth as well.

**How a vitamin D deficiency can affect your teeth:**

1\. Enamel Hypoplasia (higher risk of cavities, white spots, pits/grooves, and sensitivity to cold/heat)

2\. Missing teeth

3\. Delayed teeth

**Symptoms of a vitamin D deficiency:**

• Low calcium

• Low back pain

• Inflammation

• Low immunity

• Loss of bone
