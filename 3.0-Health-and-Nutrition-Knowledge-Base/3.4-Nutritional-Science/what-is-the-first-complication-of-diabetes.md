# What is the first complication of diabetes?

Maybe I should really say, the first complication of pre-diabetes! First, you have high insulin, which keeps your blood sugar normal for years. Then it creeps up a little bit. That’s pre-diabetes. And then it goes up even more, turning into full-blown type 2 diabetes.

The complications of diabetes really have to do with something called glycation, which is when sugar binds with protein or fat. You can get glycation from food that is made up of sugar and fat, or sugar and protein and are heated. For example, ice cream, donuts, or a hot dog or burger with a bun.

When you consume the type of sugar called fructose, it can increase glycation by up to ten times more than other sugars. And your own body can glycate too, with its own sugar.

When you take diabetes medication to lower blood sugar, where does the blood sugar go? No one talks about this! It doesn’t leave your body; instead, it gets hidden in different nooks and crannies inside you. Then it rots your body from the inside out. That’s why, even when you take diabetes medication, you still develop problems with your coronary arteries, eyes, nerves, and kidneys. So, the problem of high sugar hasn’t really been solved.

The first complication of diabetes is high insulin levels, and it gets worse from there.
