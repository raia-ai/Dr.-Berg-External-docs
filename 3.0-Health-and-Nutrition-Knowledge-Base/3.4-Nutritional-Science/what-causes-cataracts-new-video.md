# What causes cataracts? (New video)

All it takes is a small amount of oxidative stress to the eye's lens to develop a cataract. A healthy lens is composed of an organized protein called crystallin. When this tissue becomes damaged, it is not replaced. Glycation can damage the lens of the eye. It results from sugar connecting to a protein and then becoming stuck and unusable to the body. Steroids like Prednisone can also increase the risk of cataracts.

Not all surgeries can eliminate cataracts, and they can come with complications. According to “The Cataract Cure” by Dr. Marios Kyriazis, there is a safe, effective remedy for cataracts. Carnosine is a unique compound that can penetrate the lens of the eye and help with cataracts. Carnosine is a potent antioxidant that can dissolve damaged proteins. It can also activate your own antioxidants. NAC (n-acetyl carnosine) eye drops are one of the best remedies for cataracts.

The same group of scientists who performed the rabbit studies also tested NAC on humans. They selected 49 volunteers with an average age of 65 who had established age-related cataracts. After 6 months, researchers found that:

•41% of people presented a significant reduction of clouding in the lens

•90% showed a gradual improvement in vision

•89% showed up to a 100% improvement in sensitivity to glare

NAC for cataracts must be used for at least 3 to 5 months. Antioxidants such as those found in onions, egg yolks, leafy greens, and grass-fed red meat can protect you against cataracts. Vitamin A is vital for eye health and can be found in cod liver oil and grass-fed liver. B vitamins, especially B2, B6, and folate, are also essential.
