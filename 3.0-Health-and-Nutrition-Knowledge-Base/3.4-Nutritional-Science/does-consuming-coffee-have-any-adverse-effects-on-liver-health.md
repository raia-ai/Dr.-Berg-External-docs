# Does consuming coffee have any adverse effects on liver health?

In fact, coffee has the capacity to protect your liver; it’s hepatoprotective.

The liver’s main job is to detoxify, although overall it has over 500 functions. Coffee has the capacity to protect liver cells and decrease liver enzymes.

**So what’s in coffee that provides this protection?** It’s the phytonutrients (plant-based chemical antioxidants). They help regulate bile. They have anti-inflammatory properties, they can help increase vitamin D, and they stabilize blood sugars.

These phytonutrients can also help lower insulin. Lowered insulin helps your liver because high insulin can damage your liver. Coffee has more antioxidants than tea, even green tea, and red wine. Roasting coffee beans increases the antioxidants. But if you grind the beans and expose the grounds to oxygen, you lose a lot of the antioxidants. So it’s best if there’s a short time between grinding it and drinking it.

**There are many positive things about coffee, but there are also a few negatives.**

First, caffeine can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, responsible for “fight or flight.” It’s like activating your adrenals, causing sleep problems which in turn cause a cascade of health effects. A good idea is to drink just one cup in the morning. If you’re drinking coffee all day and evening, and have fatigue, you’re covering up an underlying problem that needs to be fixed.

**Coffee beans are the most heavily sprayed crop in the world. Choose organic coffee.**

The more caffeine you consume, the more you deplete vitamin B1 (thiamine), calcium and potassium. You may need supplements to replace those.
