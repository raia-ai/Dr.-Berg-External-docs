# What dietary choices are most effective in supporting the reduction of an enlarged prostate?

**Prostate Health: Understanding Enlargement and Natural Solutions**

The prostate, a walnut-sized gland located below the bladder, can become enlarged with age. This condition, known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, can cause urinary problems and sometimes increases the risk of prostate cancer.

One common cause of prostate enlargement is the conversion of testosterone to a more potent form called DHT (dihydrotestosterone). Medications exist to block this conversion, but they carry potential side effects like decreased libido, increased prostate cancer risk, and withdrawal symptoms.

**Natural Support: Lycopene and Beyond**

A natural solution lies in lycopene, a potent antioxidant found in tomatoes (especially cooked or processed tomatoes like sauce or paste). Lycopene may inhibit the enzyme that creates DHT, potentially reducing prostate enlargement and cancer risk. For the best absorption, consume tomatoes with healthy fats like olive oil.

Additional prostate-friendly nutrients include zinc and resveratrol. Conversely, avoiding milk may be beneficial for prostate health.

**Take Action**

Consider adding tomatoes to your diet twice a week, either fresh, cooked from scratch, or via quality tomato products. Growing your own or sourcing locally from a farmer's market is ideal.

**Important Note:** While natural remedies can be helpful, always consult with your doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment of prostate issues.
