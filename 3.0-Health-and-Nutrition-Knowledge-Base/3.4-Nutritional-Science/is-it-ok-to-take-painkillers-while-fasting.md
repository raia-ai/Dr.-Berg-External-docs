# Is it ok to take painkillers while fasting?

While it's essential to follow your prescribed medication regimen, fasting can be complemented by addressing pain with natural remedies. Increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D may help manage pain and inflammation. Omega-3s and vitamin D, particularly at levels around 40,000 to 50,000 IU, can be effective for reducing pain and inflammation without significant side effects.
