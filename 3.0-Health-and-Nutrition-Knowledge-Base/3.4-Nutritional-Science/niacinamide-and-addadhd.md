# Niacinamide and ADD/ADHD

**Important Note:** Before discussing supplements with anyone, especially children, *always* consult with a doctor.

**Niacinamide and ADD/ADHD: Some Background**

- Dr. William Kaufman, M.D. conducted research suggesting high doses of niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3) could potentially be helpful for individuals with ADD or ADHD.

- Vitamin B3 plays a role in creating NAD, a molecule that assists cells with energy production. This may provide more energy to nerve cells, potentially easing hyperactivity and improving focus.

- A well-functioning nervous system is important. Nutrient deficiencies can sometimes affect brain and nervous system activity. Niacinamide's effects may help reduce symptoms of ADD/ADHD.

- Because niacinamide is water-soluble, it doesn't build up in the body. Some sources suggest taking approximately 250mg, 6-8 times a day may be beneficial.

**Important Considerations**

- **Consult with a doctor:** Never change medication routines or dosages without consulting a medical professional.

- **Supplements are not a substitute for healthy eating:** While niacinamide may be helpful, a balanced diet is crucial for managing ADD/ADHD.
