# How can I help a friend to lose weight?

The #1 thing to do is help educate them about these problems. I’m going to talk about these issues in detail. Take a look. 

**1\. Cutting Calories** 

The most common mistake people make with weight loss is cutting calories. It is true that you want to reduce the frequency of meals, but you don’t want to lower your calories. Calorie reductions can cause:

• Slow metabolism

• Constant hunger

• Nutrient deficiencies. 

**2\. Low Fat**

You need healthy fats in your diet. Many people try to cut back on fats like butter and animal fat, but this is a mistake. Low-fat protein is actually much higher on the glycemic index. What this means is that it will cause your insulin to spike. The more their food choices trigger insulin, the less weight they’re going to lose. Keep in mind that fat has the least effect on insulin.

**3\. High Carbs** 

In the presence of too much insulin, you cannot lose fat. Insulin is a fat-storing hormone. Carbs are very high on the glycemic index. If you are eating carbs, you don’t be able to lose weight, you will have frequent cravings, and you will likely gain even more weight. Cut out the carbs by going on a healthy keto diet.

**4\. Monitoring Steps + Drinking Lots of Water**

This happens a lot with people who try to lose weight. They count steps, hit the treadmill or stationary bike, and drink lots of water, but they still don’t see significant results. Why? Because these things are only effective if you first work on the diet. In fact, exercise only makes up about 15% of weight loss results. Put more energy into your diet, and you’ll see far more results. 

**5\. Weighing Daily**

As you’ve probably heard me say before, get healthy to lose weight—don’t lose weight to get healthy. If you put too much of your attention on losing weight, you’re doing things backward. The main thing you can do to get healthy is to work on fixing insulin resistance with healthy keto and intermittent fasting. This can take time, so be patient. 

**6\. Six Small Meals Per Day** 

Every time you eat, you trigger insulin. If you consume 6 small meals every day, you are spiking your insulin over and over. This makes weight loss very difficult. Instead, do intermittent fasting. This will help fight off cravings, fix insulin resistance, and burn fat. 

Educate your friends and family on these points. This will give them the basics to help them lose weight.
