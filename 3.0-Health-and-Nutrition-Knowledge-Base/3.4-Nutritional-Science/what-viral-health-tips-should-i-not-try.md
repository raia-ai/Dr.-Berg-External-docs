# What viral health tips should I not try?

1\. Ear candling - This treatment has been debunked by a doctor of audiology! There is absolutely no difference in ear wax before and after ear candling.

2\. Gallbladder flush - This almost killed me! A gallbladder flush involves drinking 12 ounces of olive oil followed by beet tablets to eliminate gallstones. This really eliminates bile, causing you to become deficient. TUDCA is a much better remedy to help prevent and eliminate gallstones and bile sludge.

3\. The master cleanse - This cleanse combines lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and maple syrup, which won’t cleanse your body but will mess with your blood sugar.

4\. Foot detox pads - You can not pull toxins and heavy metals out of your feet as there are no detox pathways through the skin.

5\. Foot detox bath - Similar to foot detox pads, a chemical reaction changes the water's color during a foot detox bath, leading you to believe it’s pulling toxins out of your body.

6\. Ab belts - Stimulating the stomach muscles or sweating will not remove fat from your midsection. Visceral fat must be removed through diet and exercise.

7\. The blood type diet - This diet is not supported by credible research. Blood types relate more to an immune difference rather than a digestive difference.

8\. EMF blockers - A sticker on your cell phone can not block the EMF radiation it omits.

9\. Carb blockers - Carb blockers contain an extract that can inhibit the digestion of a minimal amount of starch, not sugar. You would need to take several bottles to inhibit the digestion of the starch from one donut.

10\. Psychiatric medication - The effectiveness of psychiatric medication can be comparable to placebo outcomes. They may also come with serious side effects and can be highly addictive.
