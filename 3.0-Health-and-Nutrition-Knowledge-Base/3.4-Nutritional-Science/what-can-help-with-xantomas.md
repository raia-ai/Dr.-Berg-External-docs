# What can help with xantomas?

To help with xanthomas, the following recommendations are provided:

1. **Niacin**:

    - Take 500 milligrams of extended-release niacin two to three times a day.

    - Niacin is one of the most potent ways to lower cholesterol.

2. **Exercise**:

    - Exercise daily, especially if you have high triglycerides, as it helps burn off extra triglycerides in the bloodstream.

3. **Dietary Changes**:

    - Consume a good portion of your protein from fish or seafood high in omega-3 fatty acids.

    - Include huge salads in your diet, around seven to ten cups daily.

    - Add walnuts to your salads for their omega-3 fatty acid precursors.

    - Use extra virgin olive oil with garlic on your salads.

4. **Supplements**:

    - Choline: Helps prevent fatty liver and reduce cholesterol.

    - TUDCA (a specialized type of bile salt): Helps with the flow of cholesterol and reduces LDL cholesterol.

    - Red yeast rice extract: Acts as a natural version of a statin and is influential in lowering cholesterol.

5. **Healthy Ketogenic Diet**:

    - Follow a ketogenic diet with a twist by consuming fat that comes with the protein, rather than adding extra fat.

These steps can assist in managing and potentially reducing xanthomas by addressing the underlying cholesterol and triglyceride buildup.

Always consult your medical healthcare provider before starting any new supplement or protocol to address a medical condition.
