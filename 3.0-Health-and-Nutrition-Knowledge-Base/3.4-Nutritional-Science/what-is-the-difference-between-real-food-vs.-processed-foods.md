# What is the difference between Real Food Vs. Processed Foods?

**Don't Be Fooled by Nutrition Labels!**

Product labels can be misleading. Let's look at two examples:

- **Product A:** 29 grams total fat, 4 grams saturated fat, 17 grams carbohydrates, 1 gram sugar.

- **Product B:** 8 grams total fat, 1 gram saturated fat, 16 grams carbohydrates, 0 grams sugar.

Based on numbers alone, you might think Product B is healthier. But here's the surprise:

- **Product A is an avocado** – a natural, whole food packed with healthy fats, vitamins, and fiber.

- **Product B is Doritos** – a highly processed snack with unhealthy ingredients like corn, vegetable oil, maltodextrin, MSG, and more.

**The Key Takeaway:** Nutrition labels tell only part of the story. To truly determine a food's healthfulness, you must examine the ingredients list.

**Real Food vs. Processed Products**

Real food nourishes your body. Ultra-processed products are often loaded with harmful ingredients and offer little nutritional value. They're a major contributor to disease and poor health.

**Focus on Ingredients, Not Numbers**

If you want to identify healthy foods, skip the nutrition facts and go straight to the ingredients. Here are 3 major red flags to look out for:

1. **Seed oils:** Highly inflammatory and damaging to your health.

2. **All forms of sugar:** Spikes blood sugar and contributes to numerous health issues.

3. **Starches:** Break down into sugar in the body, leading to the same problems as added sugar.

Choose whole, unprocessed foods for true nourishment and optimal health!
