# If I lose weight on keto, will I end up with loose, sagging belly skin?

Following a Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting can prevent loose skin after weight loss if done correctly. Your skin, the largest organ in the body, heals as you get healthier, improving collagen structure. Loose skin, or atrophy, often results from a protein deficiency worsened by insulin resistance, a common issue in weight gain.

The ketogenic diet addresses insulin resistance, enabling amino acids to enter cells and form proteins, which helps tighten the skin. During this process, you might experience a weight plateau as muscle, which is heavier than fat, rebuilds. However, you’ll notice your size shrinking and your waist getting smaller.

Combining keto with intermittent fasting spikes growth hormone levels up to 2000%, further preserving protein and supporting skin recovery.
