In addition to being rich in vitamins A, C, D, and E, as well as minerals such as iodine and iron, it also contains fucoidan, which has potentially anti-inflammatory properties.

"Seaweed" refers to any marine plant or algae that grows in saltwater environments. This includes red algae (such as nori), green algae (such as sea lettuce), and brown algae (such as bladderwrack).

Like sea kelp, seaweeds contain nutrients, including vitamins B12 and C, calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron, and copper - making them one of nature's most nutrient-dense foods.
