# What are the most effective strategies or treatments for managing and alleviating the symptoms of endometriosis?

Endometriosis is a very uncomfortable and often painful issue caused by estrogen dominance. To help relieve symptoms of endometriosis, you will want to get your estrogen balanced.

Dr. Berg's video on the subject can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yINSNtpCX2Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yINSNtpCX2Q).

As the video outlines, consuming organic foods is a great place to start. This will help you avoid estrogenic hormones and chemicals that can increase estrogen production.

Cruciferous vegetables can help balance estrogen as well. You can also consume a concentrated form of crucifers called DIM. Another nutrient you will want to add to your diet is iodine.

Dr. Berg has DIM Supplement Estrogen Balance which was specifically formulated to help with issues related to estrogen dominance. You can review the product page here - [https://shop.drberg.com/product/estrogen-balance-with-dim](https://shop.drberg.com/product/estrogen-balance-with-dim).
