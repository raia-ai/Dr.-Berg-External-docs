# Can I consume berries on keto?

Yes, in moderate amounts.

Berries are loaded with phytonutrients. These phytonutrients have some really interesting potential health properties.

A few potential health benefits of berries:

- They’re antioxidants

- They can help blood sugars

- They’re high in fiber

- They’re high in vitamin C

- They can help reduce inflammation

The best berries to have on keto (1 cup):

- Strawberry – net carbs 8.1 g, sugar 7 g

- Blueberry – net carbs 17.4 g, sugar 15 g

- Blackberry – net carbs 6 g, sugar 7 g

- Raspberry – net carbs 7 g, sugar 5 g

Dried berries can have as much as 132 g of net carbs and 80 g of sugar per cup. So fresh and frozen berries are keto-friendly, but dried berries are not keto-friendly and should be avoided.
