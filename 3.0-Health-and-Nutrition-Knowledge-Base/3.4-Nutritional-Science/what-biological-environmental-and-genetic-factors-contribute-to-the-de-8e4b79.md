# What biological, environmental, and genetic factors contribute to the development of allergies?

Allergic responses occur when the immune system has a hyperreaction to common and uncommon substances, which cause excess inflammation and many other symptoms.

**Cause: Low stomach acidity**

A low-acid stomach can create digestive problems. With low stomach acid some proteins end up undigested, resulting in your immune system attacking it inappropriately. This will cause hypersensitivity and allergic reactions.

Also, overgrowth of bad bacteria can cause increased intolerance to allergens.Acidifying the stomach can reduce the overgrowth of bad bacteria.
