**Frequently Asked Questions**

**What is the difference between a Product Complaint and an Adverse Event**

 A product complaint is a change in appearance, taste, consistency, or other changes related to the product itself.  An adverse event is a physical reaction to the products such as bloating, rash, stomach issues, increased heart rate, dizziness, etc.

**What if the customer does not have all the information needed for the Product Complaint?**

Try to gather as much information as possible so our team can review the complaint. We would like to have the customer send us images of the product/lot number rather than us using details in ProPack

**If someone has a product complaint, can we refund the product if it is outside of the 30-day money back guarantee timeframe?**

Yes, you can refund the product that caused product complaint. If over 6 months, please reach out to leadership for further review.
