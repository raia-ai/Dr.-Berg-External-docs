# What is lactose intolerance?

Experiencing discomfort after consuming dairy? It could be lactose intolerance, a common digestive issue where your body struggles to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products.

**What is Lactose Intolerance?**

Lactose intolerance arises from insufficient lactase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down lactose. While digestive upset like bloating, gas, and diarrhea are common symptoms, lactose intolerance can also manifest as headaches, fatigue, joint pain, and even skin issues.

**Causes of Lactose Intolerance**

- **Primary:** The most common type, often genetically predisposed and developing gradually with age.

- **Secondary:** Triggered by underlying conditions like Crohn's disease, celiac disease, or medications like antibiotics.

- **Congenital:** Rare, present from birth due to genetics.

**Managing Lactose Intolerance**

- **Listen to your body:** Understand your tolerance level for dairy.

- **Lactase Supplements:** Take these over-the-counter pills before consuming dairy.

- **Alternatives:** Explore lactose-free milk substitutes like almond, soy, or oat milk. Try dairy-free cheeses and yogurts.

- **Probiotics:** Found in yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi, these beneficial bacteria can aid digestion and gut health.

**Living with Lactose Intolerance**

Thriving with lactose intolerance is achievable. It involves awareness, adaptation, and a focus on gut health. Keep a food diary to identify triggers, experiment with lactose-free options, and consider incorporating probiotics for overall digestive wellness.

**Important Note:** If you experience symptoms, consult your healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and guidance.
