# What are the underlying causes of low tolerance for stress, and how do psychological, environmental, and physiological factors contribute to this condition?

Low tolerance for stress is a condition where you can get an excessive reaction to things that normally wouldnâ€™t cause so much reaction. You may get worried about little things or become easily irritated about them.

**Symptoms:**

- Worry/anxiety

- Nervous tension

- Being critical

- Excessive thinking at night

- Serious impact after bad news

**Cause #1: Adrenal fatigue**

Your adrenals are producing stress hormones to help you fight stressors from your environment. If the stress is constant, or chronic, this can wear out your adrenals-- making them unable to keep up with stress and unable to calm you down after it.

**Cause #2: Blood sugar fluctuations**

If you are on a high-carb diet, this can cause blood sugar fluctuations in your body. When your blood sugar goes high (after eating a high-carb meal) this can elevate your mood; however, shortly after you will feel irritated and can feel stressed out. This is because blood sugar will get lowered (to a point below the normal level) by insulin. Frequent eating, and refined carbs specifically, increase the production of insulin. Carbs in your diet will also deplete you of vitamin B1, which is an anti-stress vitamin.
