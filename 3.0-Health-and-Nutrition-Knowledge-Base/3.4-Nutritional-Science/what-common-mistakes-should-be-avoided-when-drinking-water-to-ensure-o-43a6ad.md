# What common mistakes should be avoided when drinking water to ensure optimal hydration and health?

**Myth #1:** Once you feel thirsty, dehydration has already set in Truth: While feeling thirsty is a sign that your body needs more fluids, it does not necessarily mean you are dehydrated. Your body is designed to give you signals when you need more water, so just drink when you feel thirsty.

**Myth #2:** Drink water until your urine is clear Truth: Your urine should be a pale straw color or light yellow. If it's too clear, it means you are overhydrated; if it is too dark, it could indicate a potential health issue with your liver or kidneys.

**Myth #3:** Drink water to feel full and reduce food intake Truth: While replacing sugary drinks with water can help you lose weight, drinking more water does not directly lead to fat loss.

**Myth #4:** Drinking more water will flush out toxins Truth: Most toxins are fat-soluble and are not flushed out by drinking water alone. The body has its own detoxification system, so just focus on staying hydrated instead of trying to "detox" with excessive water intake.

**Myth #5:** Water will prevent dehydration Truth: While it is true that hydration is vital for overall health, simply drinking water will not prevent dehydration. Other factors, such as electrolytes play an important role in preventing dehydration.

**Myth #6:** Drink more water Truth: Drinking massive amounts of water can lead to imbalances in the body. Certain situations will call for more water intake—just don't overdo it. If you're prone to kidney stones, you need at least 2.5 liters of fluid per day

**Myth #7:** Drink water right before you eat Truth: Drinking water before meals is fine, but it may cause discomfort for individuals who experience heartburn or bloating.

**A few more key points to remember:**

• If you're prone to kidney stones, consider adding lemon to your water.

• Add a little bit of baking soda to your water if you experience gout symptoms.

• The keto flu or fatigue experienced by some individuals on a keto diet is often due to not consuming enough electrolytes with their water, specifically salt.

• Proper hydration is vital for kidney health, but drinking more water won't cleanse or "flush out" the kidneys.
