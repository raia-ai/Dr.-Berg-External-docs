# Why can I not quit chocolate?

Chocolate contains over 380 chemicals, with three main ones creating pleasure sensations:

1\. **Phenylalanine**: Builds dopamine, enhancing mood, and producing endorphins for euphoria. Also increases noradrenaline for alertness.

2\. **Theobromine**: Similar to caffeine, it boosts mental clarity, acts as a diuretic and vasodilator. Not ideal if you have liver issues as it may disrupt sleep due to slower clearance.

3\. **Tryptophan**: Precursor to serotonin, promoting calmness, reducing stress, and lifting mood. Often consumed when feeling down.

Enjoy chocolate in moderation, preferably sugar-free with sweeteners like erythritol, stevia, or monk fruit. Avoid consuming it late in the day to prevent sleep disturbances.
