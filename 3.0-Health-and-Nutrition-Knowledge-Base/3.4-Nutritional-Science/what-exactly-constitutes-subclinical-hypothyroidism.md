# What exactly constitutes subclinical hypothyroidism?

Subclinical hypothyroidism occurs when thyroid function is slow, but blood tests appear normal. Key trace minerals essential for thyroid function include iodine, selenium, copper, and zinc. Zinc is particularly crucial as it aids in the conversion and synthesis of thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) and the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

A hypothyroid condition can impede zinc absorption, potentially leading to a deficiency. If you have thyroid symptoms, consider increasing your zinc intake through shellfish, sea kelp, or supplements.
