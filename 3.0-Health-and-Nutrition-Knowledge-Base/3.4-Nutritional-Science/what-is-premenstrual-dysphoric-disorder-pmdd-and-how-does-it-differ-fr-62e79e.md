# What is Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), and how does it differ from typical premenstrual symptoms in terms of severity and impact on daily life?

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of PMS or premenstrual syndrome.

**A few symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD):**

• Bloating

• Headaches

• Breast tenderness

• Anxiety

• Depression

There seems to be a lot of information about PMDD but no information that’s going to help correct the problem. Most information is on how to live with the problem more comfortably. With PMDD, the person has a hormonal imbalance situation. Typically, estrogen is low, but progesterone is severely low. This can give the appearance of an estrogen dominance situation, but it’s not really an estrogen dominance situation.

**What you can do for PMDD:**

• Avoid all dairy

• Consume cruciferous vegetables or take DIM

• Consume sea kelp (iodine)

• Take vitamin D (10,000-20,000IU per day)
