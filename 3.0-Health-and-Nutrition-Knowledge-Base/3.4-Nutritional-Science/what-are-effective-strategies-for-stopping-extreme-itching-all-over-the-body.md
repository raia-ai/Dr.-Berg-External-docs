# What are effective strategies for stopping extreme itching all over the body?

To address extreme itching across your body, consider the following steps:

1\. **TUDCA Supplementation**: Take TUDCA, a bile salt that aids in enhancing bile duct drainage in the liver. Start with two capsules daily on an empty stomachâ€”one in the morning and one in the afternoon. This can help reduce systemic itching by alleviating bile accumulation in the liver, which may enter the bloodstream and cause skin irritation.

2\. **Gut Microbiome Support**: Support your gut health, particularly if you've used steroids, which can disrupt your gut flora. Begin with a high-quality probiotic, starting with a small dose and gradually increasing it to minimize potential immune reactions.

These measures may help mitigate the itching and improve overall skin comfort.
