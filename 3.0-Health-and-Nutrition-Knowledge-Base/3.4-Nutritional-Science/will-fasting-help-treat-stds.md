There’s a 2014 study about alternate day fasting – 12 weeks helped salmonella-infected mice clear pathogenic bacteria.

**Alternate day fasting is when you eat what you want every other day and on the days that you are fasting, you reduce the calorie intake. In dealing with bacteria and viruses in remission, here are things to consider:**

2\. Autophagy – 18+ hours

3\. Vitamin D – Sun
