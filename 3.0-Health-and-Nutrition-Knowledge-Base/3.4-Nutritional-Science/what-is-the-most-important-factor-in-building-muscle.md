# What is the most important factor in building muscle?

We often think that increasing protein helps build muscle because muscle is made of protein. But this doesn’t always work. Some people that eat more protein may even suffer from amino acid deficiency. You need sufficient amounts of protein to build muscle, but, more importantly, you need sufficient amino acids. The general thought is that you need .8 grams of protein per kilogram of lean body mass—not overall weight. This might look like around 50 grams of protein per day. A moderate amount of protein would be between 1.2 and 1.7 grams per kilogram of lean body mass. High protein would be about 2 grams per kilogram of lean body mass. It’s essential to focus on consuming quality protein from eggs, meat, fish, and dairy. It’s not ideal to rely on getting your protein from plant sources or protein powder to build healthy muscles.
