# What is the process for making keto pasta?

**Keto Pasta**
**Ingredients:**
3 to 6 oz ground beef
1⁄2 cup low-carb tomato sauce
1 Tbsp safflower oil
1 bag shirataki “spaghetti” noodles 1⁄4 medium onion
1 clove garlic
1 Tbsp butter
parsley for garnish
parmesan cheese for garnish

**Instructions for spaghetti sauce:**
1\. Put 1⁄2 tablespoon of oil into a pot and cook ground beef. 2. Add low-carb spaghetti sauce.
3\. Add some garlic and onions, if your macros allow!

**Instructions for noodles:**

1\. Drain noodles.

2\. In a pan, add 1⁄2 Tbsp of oil and onions and cook on medium-low heat for 5 minutes.

3\. Add noodles, turn up heat to medium-high and saute noodles for 5 to 7 minutes. Keep moving them around. This is going to cook the onion flavor into the noodles.

4\. Salt heavily.
5\. Remove from heat; add butter and stir until melted and mixed completely. 6. Add spaghetti sauce.
7\. Garnish with cheese and parsley and serve with a big salad!
