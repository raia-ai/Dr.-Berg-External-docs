# Can fenugreek help with hair loss when taking creatine?

Fenugreek may help mitigate hair loss associated with creatine use due to its potential to influence DHT levels, a potent form of testosterone linked to hair follicle health. Essential co-factors like zinc, copper, and selenium are crucial for activating proteins necessary for hair growth. Additionally, ensuring adequate intake of trace minerals and B vitamins is essential for supporting overall hair health.
