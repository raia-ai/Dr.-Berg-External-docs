# What is the most effective vitamin for promoting the shrinking of fibroids?

Up to 80% of women will develop fibroids by age 40. In this video, we'll take a look at the causes of fibroids that could be related to vitamin deficiency. Find out how to help shrink fibroids naturally and alleviate fibroid symptoms with one vitamin. Fibroids decrease in size after menopause, yet pregnancy, exposure to HRT, and birth control pills can cause fibroids to enlarge. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and PCOS also increase the risk of fibroids. Black women have a 3 to 9 times higher risk of developing fibroids.

Estrogen is the primary driver of fibroids and endometriosis. A fibroid is a growth in the uterus, but it differs from uterine tissue in several ways. Fibroids are very sensitive to estrogen and have increased estrogen receptors, more of the enzyme aromatase, less oxygen than the uterus, and more inflammation.

Many health problems and risk factors associated with fibroids are related to low vitamin D. Vitamin D has incredible properties that may help inhibit the growth of fibroids.

There is also a vast amount of anecdotal evidence in support of using vitamin D to shrink fibroids.

Be sure to take vitamin D with the cofactors magnesium and vitamin K2.

It's important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, including vitamin D, to ensure proper dosage and to discuss any potential interactions with other medications or health conditions.
