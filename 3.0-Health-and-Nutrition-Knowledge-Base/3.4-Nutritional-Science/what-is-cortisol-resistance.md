# What is cortisol resistance?

Insulin resistance is a prediabetic state. Any time there is a resistance situation, you have a hormone that’s not going into the cells properly. The receptor that is supposed to receive the hormone is resistive, and it’s blocking the hormone from going in. With this situation, you can have a lot of the hormone in the body, but you’re not getting the effect of the hormone. You can actually have symptoms of too much of the hormone and a deficiency of the hormone at the same time. 

Cortisol is a stress hormone. It counters and deals with stress. When you have stress over a long period of time, the receptor that’s supposed to receive that hormone starts to block it.
