# What are the most effective medical and lifestyle interventions for addressing mitral valve prolapse, particularly in cases where symptoms or complications require treatment?

If you have mitral valve prolapse, your heart valves are not opening and closing correctly.

**Mitral valve prolapse causes floppy, leaky valves that are large and bulging.** This bulging, displaced tissue is called prolapse, which leads to inefficient heart pumping. Mitral valve prolapse symptoms include weakness, fatigue, palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath. It’s often described as idiopathic, which means it has no known cause. Mitral valve prolapse is generally treated with beta-blockers or a calcium channel blocker.

In a double-blind study, 141 subjects with mitral valve prolapse were compared to 40 healthy subjects. Sixty percent of the mitral valve prolapse group had magnesium deficiency compared to only 5% of the healthy subjects.

**Low magnesium leads to high adrenaline.** It also accelerates the aging of the fibroblast cell, which helps you make collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid. As we age, the fibroblast cell is very important for our skin, ligaments, tendons, and valves.

**One of the first signs of magnesium deficiency is tetany.** Surprisingly, 85% of people with mitral valve prolapse have tetany! Don’t just rely on the RDA if you’re deficient in magnesium. Try taking 400 mg 2 to 3 times a day, working up to this amount slowly. Also, ensure you’re getting enough vitamin D. Magnesium won’t work without vitamin D!

**WHAT TO DO**

Avoid sugar and refined carbs because they significantly decrease magnesium. It takes years for a magnesium deficiency to show up and it can take up to a year to correct. Try magnesium glycinate to increase your magnesium levels over time.
