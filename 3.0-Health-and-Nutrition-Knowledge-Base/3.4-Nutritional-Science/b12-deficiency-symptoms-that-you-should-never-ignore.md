# B12 Deficiency Symptoms That You Should NEVER Ignore

While it's true that vegans and vegetarians are at a higher risk, vitamin B12 deficiency can affect anyone. This crucial nutrient plays a role in DNA production and repair, and a deficiency can elevate your cancer risk. It also supports nerve health, and a shortage can lead to anemia.

Early signs of deficiency include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, and tingling in the extremities.

As the deficiency progresses, you might experience:

• Tongue changes (red, swollen, shiny)

• Mouth ulcers

• Shortness of breath

• Dizziness upon standing

• Cognitive issues

• Anxiety and depression

• Sleep disruptions

• Vitiligo (skin patches)

Severe deficiency can result in walking difficulties, muscle weakness, and serious psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations. It can even lead to permanent nerve damage.

If you don't eat animal products regularly, you're at risk. Incorporate foods like clams, liver, sardines, red meat, tuna, salmon, grass-fed dairy, and eggs into your diet.

Low stomach acid or a genetic issue called polymorphism can also hinder B12 absorption.

If you supplement, choose methylcobalamin, the natural form. Remember, a healthy liver, small intestine, and acidic stomach are essential for proper B12 absorption and function.
