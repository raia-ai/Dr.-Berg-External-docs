# What beverages should I avoid on a Healthy Keto diet plan?

Diet soda or any drink with aspartame, NutraSweet, Equal, Splenda, sucralose, saccharine, or acesulfame potassium (another artificial sweetener), alcohol drinks, coconut water (because of the sugar content), fruit juice, sweetened cranberry juice, and milk (except for half and half and heavy cream).
