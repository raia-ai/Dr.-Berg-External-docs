# How can I mitigate morning hunger?

**Mitigating Morning Hunger**

To effectively manage morning hunger, especially on specific diets, consider these strategies:

1\. **Increase Fat Intake**: Adding healthy fats, such as avocados and nuts, can stabilize blood sugar levels and reduce hunger, providing sustained energy.

2\. **Incorporate Apple Cider Vinegar**: A splash before meals may help stabilize glucose levels and curb cravings, aiding in better appetite control.

3\. **Add More Vegetables**: Vegetables are high in fiber and nutrients while low in calories, helping to satisfy hunger without disrupting dietary goals.
