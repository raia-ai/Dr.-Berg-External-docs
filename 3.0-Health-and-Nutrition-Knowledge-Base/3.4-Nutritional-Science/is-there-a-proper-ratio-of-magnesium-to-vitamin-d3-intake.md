# Is there a proper ratio of magnesium to vitamin D3 intake?

While there isnâ€™t a universally agreed-upon ratio of magnesium to vitamin D3, recent research has shed light on the crucial relationship between these two nutrients. Magnesium is vital for vitamin D synthesis, transport, and activation. It acts as a cofactor in the enzymatic reactions that convert vitamin D into its active form, 1,25(OH)2D. The daily intake recommendations for magnesium are 420 mg for men and 320 mg for women, independent of vitamin D supplementation. Research suggests that maintaining adequate levels of both nutrients is more important than a specific ratio. Magnesium deficiency can impair vitamin D metabolism, while vitamin D supplementation without sufficient magnesium may not be as effective.
