# What strategies can be employed to facilitate the restoration and regeneration of bone tissue?

Osteoporosis is a loss of bone density and bone mass. This increases your risk of fractures. Osteopenia is the stage that occurs just before osteoporosis. It’s been found that people with osteoporosis have a much higher degree of calcification in the arteries and joints. This means a person has excess calcium, but it’s not going to the right places in the body. When dealing with osteoporosis and osteopenia, we can’t just look at a loss of calcium. We also need to consider vitamin K2 deficiency and vitamin D3 deficiency.

Vitamin D3 supports calcium absorption, and vitamin K2 helps drive calcium into the bones. If you take vitamin K2 as a supplement, it may be best to take the natural form called MK7. Vitamin A (retinol) is another important vitamin to support healthy bones. These essential vitamins for osteoporosis are all fat-soluble, which means supporting your gallbladder and liver is crucial. Bile salts can help support the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients if you have a gallbladder or liver problem. It’s also essential to have strong acid in the stomach to absorb minerals and trace minerals.

I would still take some form of calcium if I had osteoporosis. But I would also take these other nutrients. I would also avoid calcium carbonate, which is less bioavailable than other forms. Try to get your calcium and other nutrients from food.

**Other important minerals and trace minerals for strong bones:**

• Magnesium

• Potassium

• Zinc

• Copper

• Boron

Be sure you’re also consuming high-quality sources of protein and are exercising consistently to help with osteoporosis and osteopenia.
