# What are the various treatment options and management approaches for addressing seborrheic keratosis, and how do these methods impact the condition's progression and appearance?

For seborrheic keratosis, consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate treatment. Consider addressing potential vitamin deficiencies: Vitamin A and Vitamin D, often linked to liver or gallbladder issues, and Vitamin B2. Additionally, improving the ratio of Omega-3 to Omega-6 fatty acids by increasing Omega-3 intake and reducing sources like soy, corn, and cottonseed oils can benefit skin health.
