# Could a deficiency in vitamin B12 be contributing to my respiratory difficulties during physical activities?

Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in the production of red blood cells, and a deficiency can lead to conditions such as pernicious anemia. Anemia may also stem from deficiencies in folic acid or iron, which can contribute to feelings of fatigue or a lack of energy. It's important to note that B12 is primarily obtained from animal products. However, even if you consume these foods, inadequate hydrochloric acid levels can hinder your ability to extract this essential vitamin from meat proteins. Consequently, various factors can impede B12 absorption, and a deficiency can certainly leave you feeling winded, particularly during physical exertion, such as climbing inclines.
