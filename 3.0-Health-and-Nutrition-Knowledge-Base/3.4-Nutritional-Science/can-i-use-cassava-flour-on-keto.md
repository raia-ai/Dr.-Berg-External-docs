# Can I use cassava flour on keto?

No. Cassava is very high in carbohydrates. It’s also very high on the glycemic index. Cassava is a starch – a root vegetable. It’s not keto-friendly. Cassava is also used to make tapioca, which is not keto-friendly, either. Another name for cassava is yuca. Cassava or yuca are not keto- friendly.

Cassava also contains very small amounts of vitamin B1 (thiamine). This is a problem because any time you have something with a lot of carbs and low vitamin B1, you can create a vitamin B1 deficiency. This happens because you use up vitamin B1 to metabolize carbs.
