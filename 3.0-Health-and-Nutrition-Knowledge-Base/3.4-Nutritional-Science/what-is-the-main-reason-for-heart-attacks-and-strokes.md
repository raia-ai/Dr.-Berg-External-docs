# What is the main reason for heart attacks and strokes?

If someone dies from a heart attack or stroke, their death is typically the result of a clot. A clot can form in less than 5 seconds! Usually, your body should form a clot, fix the hole in the artery, then dissolve the clot, but this doesn’t always happen.

Clots can be caused by the following:

•Smoking

•Pollution/chemicals

•Alcohol

•Birth control pills

•Stress

•Surgery

•Endurance sports

•Refined starches

•Infection

•High blood sugar

•Inflammation

Excess calcium in the arteries can also trigger clotting, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Postmenopausal women who take large amounts of calcium are at a much greater risk for blood clots. Calcium is involved in over 15 different clotting factors. Vitamin K2 prevents calcium from building up in the soft tissues and arteries. It is found in dairy, butter, and other fatty foods. Always take vitamin D with vitamin K2. Magnesium is another important calcium regulator. It helps prevent calcium from entering the soft tissues, as well as arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. Nitric oxide can reduce clotting. Vitamin D, L-arginine, and sunlight can increase nitric oxide to help prevent heart attack. Polyphenols, vitamin C, and omega-3 fatty acids all support heart health and may help reduce your risk of clotting. Keto and intermittent fasting can help reduce clotting by reducing inflammation in your arteries. Regular moderate exercise is vital in preventing clotting. Garlic and onion are also essential. Nattokinase, serrapeptase, and bromelain can be taken as supplements to prevent clotting.
