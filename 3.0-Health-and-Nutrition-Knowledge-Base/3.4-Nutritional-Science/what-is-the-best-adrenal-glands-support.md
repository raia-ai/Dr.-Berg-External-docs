# What is the best adrenal glands support?

The purpose of the adrenal glands is to adapt your body to physical and mental stress. Out of all of the vitamins and minerals, the adrenal gland has the highest concentration of vitamin C. Vitamin C is crucial to the healthy function of the adrenal cortex and medulla.

Vitamin C is a co-factor or helper nutrient for catecholaminesâ€”which are the neurotransmitters inside the adrenals (like serotonin, dopamine, and adrenaline).

Vitamin C is also a co-factor for the steroid hormones outside of the gland (like cortisol, aldosterone, and androgens). Additionally, vitamin C acts as an antioxidant in the adrenal glands.
