# Use Your Feet to Diagnose Liver Problems

One common sign of liver problems is red and brown spots on the lower leg. These spots are caused by poor circulation and are often seen in people who have diabetes or cirrhosis of the liver. When the liver isn't functioning properly, you may experience bruising and discoloration.

You may also notice that the lower leg is swollen and shiny and no longer grows hair. Pitting edema may accompany these symptoms. The good news about liver problems is that the liver is one of the only organs that can completely regenerate itself!

Spider veins, whether in the lower leg and foot or anywhere else on the body, signify that the liver can no longer regulate estrogen. Excess estrogen can cause a fatty liver and problems with your bile ducts, which can lead to gallstones.

Dry, cracked heels or generally dry feet are symptoms of an omega-3 deficiency.

The liver makes bile, which helps you break down and absorb fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients. If you have liver damage, it will be difficult to absorb omega-3 fatty acids. Rarely, dry, cracked heels may be related to a B3 deficiency.

Other foot-related symptoms that typically signify liver damage include:

•Itchy feet

•Fungal infections

•Inflammatory conditions like arthritis and plantar fasciitis

•Foot odor

•Hot/cold feet

•Toenail fungus

•Fungus between toes
