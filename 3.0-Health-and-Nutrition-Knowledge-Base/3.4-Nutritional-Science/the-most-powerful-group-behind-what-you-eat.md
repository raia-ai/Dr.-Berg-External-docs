# The Most Powerful Group Behind What You Eat

In the food industry, immense power resides with a mere quartet of companies: Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus. These four giants dominate the global grain trade, controlling a staggering 90%. Their influence extends to products derived from corn, soy, wheat, sugar, and rice, which collectively constitute roughly 68% of the average American's caloric intake.

These companies act as intermediaries between farmers and food corporations, wielding significant control over the supply chain. However, the food industry is not without its problems. Rampant corruption exists, with many "junk food brands" also owning organic and natural brands, pet food, and even vitamin and supplement companies.

A common thread among ultra-processed foods is their reliance on starches, sugars, and seed oils. Sugar is employed to create addictive cravings, seed oils are essentially repurposed waste, and starches, composed of sugar chains, serve as fillers.

Worryingly, starches trigger a more dramatic insulin spike than sugar itself. Maltodextrin, a common starch, has a glycemic index of 185, dwarfing sugar's index of 65. The overconsumption of fillers and starches can lead to serious health issues.

Remember, consumer choices hold immense power. By opting for healthier alternatives, we can reduce the demand for these harmful products, thereby influencing the market and promoting positive change.
