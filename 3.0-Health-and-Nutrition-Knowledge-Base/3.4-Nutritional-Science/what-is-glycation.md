# What is Glycation?

### **What is Glycation?**

Glycation is a chemical reaction that occurs when sugars, such as glucose, fructose, or galactose, bond with proteins or lipids without the control of enzymes.

This process is also known as the Maillard reaction, named after the French chemist Louis Camille Maillard who first described it in the early 1900s.

During glycation, the sugar molecules attach to the free amino groups of proteins, forming unstable compounds called Schiff bases. These compounds then undergo further rearrangement to form more stable, but still reversible, structures known as Amadori products.

Over time, these Amadori products can undergo additional chemical reactions, leading to the formation of AGEs.

### **The Formation of AGEs**

AGEs can form both endogenously (within the body) and exogenously (from external sources). Endogenous AGEs are produced as a natural byproduct of metabolism, particularly when blood sugar levels are consistently high, as in the case of poorly managed diabetes.

Exogenous AGEs, on the other hand, are introduced into the body through dietary sources, particularly foods that are high in fat and protein and have been exposed to high temperatures during cooking.

[High-fat diets](https://www.drberg.com/blog/6-benefits-of-a-high-fat-diet) are particularly problematic when combined with sugar, as this combination accelerates the formation of AGEs.

When we consume foods that are high in both sugar and protein or fat, the glycation process is further promoted, leading to a more rapid accumulation of AGEs in our bodies.
