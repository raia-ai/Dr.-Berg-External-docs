# What are the best nuts for replenishing zinc, and how do they support health and immune function?

Pine nuts, cashews, and Brazil nuts all provide a good source of zinc. Although not a nut, pumpkin seeds are an excellent source of zinc as well. If you add these nuts and seeds to your diet, always soak or roast them to help reduce their phytic acid content.
