# Can intermittent fasting help with psoriasis?

Yes, intermittent fasting can help with psoriasis. Here are some key points from Dr. Berg's recommendations:

- **Reducing Inflammation**: Intermittent fasting has been shown to reduce inflammation in the body, which is a key factor in many chronic diseases, including psoriasis. By giving your digestive system a break and allowing your body to focus on repair and regeneration, you can help calm the inflammatory response and promote overall healing.

- **Cell Regeneration**: During fasting periods, the body undergoes a process of cell regeneration, which can help strengthen the immune response. This process is beneficial for skin health as it helps remove damaged cells and promotes the growth of new, healthier cells.

- **Hormonal Balance**: Intermittent fasting can help regulate insulin levels and increase growth hormone levels. This hormonal change triggers autophagy, a cellular cleanup operation that eliminates accumulated cell debris, which could otherwise trigger skin issues like psoriasis.

- **Immune System Enhancement**: Fasting has been shown to enhance immune function by stimulating the production of white blood cells and antibodies, helping your body fight off infections and diseases more effectively. A stronger immune system can better manage autoimmune conditions like psoriasis.

By incorporating intermittent fasting into your routine, you may experience improvements in psoriasis symptoms due to reduced inflammation, enhanced cell regeneration, and a stronger immune system. Always consult with your healthcare provider before making significant changes to your diet or fasting regimen.
