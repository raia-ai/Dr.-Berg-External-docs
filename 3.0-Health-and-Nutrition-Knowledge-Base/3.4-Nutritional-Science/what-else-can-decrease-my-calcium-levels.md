# What else can decrease my calcium levels?

While we've covered the essentials of calcium and nutrition, there are other crucial aspects to consider for maintaining optimal bone health.

### **1\. The Importance of Weight-Bearing Exercise**

Just like muscles, bones become stronger with regular exercise. Weight-bearing exercises, in particular, are crucial for building and maintaining bone density. These exercises force your body to work against gravity, stimulating bone-building cells. Aim for at least 30 minutes of weight-bearing exercise most days of the week. Here are some examples:

- Walking: A simple yet effective way to improve bone density, especially for beginners. Brisk walking is ideal.

- Running/Jogging: Provides a higher impact than walking, leading to greater bone strengthening.

- Dancing: A fun and engaging way to incorporate weight-bearing movements.

- Stair Climbing: Excellent for building bone density in the legs and hips.

- Strength Training: Lifting weights or using resistance bands helps build muscle mass, which in turn, supports bone health.

### **2\. The Detrimental Effects of Smoking**

Smoking is harmful to nearly every organ in the body, including your bones. It interferes with calcium absorption and reduces bone density, making bones weaker and more prone to fractures.

If you smoke, quitting is one of the best things you can do for your bone health, as well as your overall well-being.

### **3\. Understanding the Role of Genetics**

While lifestyle choices play a significant role in bone health, genetics also factor in. A family history of osteoporosis or low bone density can increase your risk. If you have such a history, talk to your doctor.

They may recommend bone density screenings earlier than usual to monitor your bone health and discuss preventive measures.
