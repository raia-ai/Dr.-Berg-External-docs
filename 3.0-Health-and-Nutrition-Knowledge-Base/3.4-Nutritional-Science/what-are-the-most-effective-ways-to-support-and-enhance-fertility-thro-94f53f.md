# What are the most effective ways to support and enhance fertility through lifestyle, diet, and other strategies?

Supporting fertility involves several key strategies, especially as you prepare your body for pregnancy. Prioritize a nutrient-rich diet, focusing on vitamin E in the form of tocotrienols, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and essential trace minerals. Royal jelly, known for its fertility-enhancing properties, can also be beneficial. Additionally, be mindful of environmental factors, such as exposure to GMO foods, which may negatively impact fertility. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and minimizing these risks are crucial steps in fostering optimal reproductive health.
