**Is Stevia a Good Sugar Substitute?**

Dr. Eric Berg confirms that plain stevia is a beneficial addition to your diet. As a natural, zero-calorie sweetener, stevia does not raise blood sugar levels or contribute to health issues related to excessive sugar consumption. Opting for high-quality, plain stevia products ensures you reap the benefits while avoiding unwanted additives.

**Stevia vs. Sucralose**

In the search for healthier sugar alternatives, stevia and sucralose are often compared. Stevia, derived from the Stevia rebaudiana plant, offers zero calories and minimal impact on blood sugar. Sucralose, an artificial sweetener, provides sweetness without calories but may raise concerns about its effects on blood sugar. Evaluating these options helps make informed decisions about sweeteners and their impact on health.
