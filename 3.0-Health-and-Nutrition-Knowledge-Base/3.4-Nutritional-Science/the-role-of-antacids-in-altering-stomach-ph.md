# The Role of Antacids in Altering Stomach pH

## **The Role of Antacids in Altering Stomach pH**

Antacids, a common go-to for heartburn relief, can drastically change our stomach's acidity. They work by neutralizing excess acid.

Research has shown that these remedies can lead to conditions like hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria when overused. That's right - consuming too many antacids may lower your stomach acid more than necessary.

### **Understanding Antacid Overuse**

"Too much of a good thing can be detrimental." While antacids are helpful in small doses, consistent use could create problems with protein digestion and mineral absorption due to reduced acidity.

You might think 'less acid equals less pain,' but let me surprise you: low stomach acid can increase your risk of allergies. So before reaching for an antacid next time you feel discomfort, remember moderation is key.
