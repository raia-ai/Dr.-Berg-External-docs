# Can I take calcium and magnesium together?

Generally, it's **not recommended** to take magnesium and calcium supplements at the same time.

Here's why:

- **Competition for Absorption:** Magnesium and calcium compete for the same absorption pathways in your gut. Taking them together can lead to decreased absorption of one or both minerals.  

- **Potential Imbalance:** If you're already deficient in one mineral, taking them together could further exacerbate the imbalance.

However, there are nuances to consider:

- **Specific Needs:** Some individuals might benefit from taking both supplements if they have deficiencies in both minerals. In such cases, it's important to consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dosage and timing.

- **Timing:** If you need to take both supplements, consider spacing them out by a few hours to minimize competition for absorption.

**Overall, the best approach is to:**

- **Talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian:** They can assess your individual needs and provide personalized recommendations.

- **Prioritize dietary sources:** Whenever possible, try to get these minerals from whole foods. Magnesium-rich foods include leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Calcium-rich foods include dairy products and leafy greens
