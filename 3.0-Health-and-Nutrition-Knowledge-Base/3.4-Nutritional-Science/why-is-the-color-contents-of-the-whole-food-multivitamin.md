# Why is the color contents of the Whole Food Multivitamin?

The Whole Food Multivitamin contents of the capsule are tan in color and come from mixing various fruits, vegetables, and minerals. When blended, their natural pigments combine into a tan hue. Even with freeze-drying, large-scale mixing often results in a neutral color instead of the bright colors youâ€™d see from single-ingredient powders.
