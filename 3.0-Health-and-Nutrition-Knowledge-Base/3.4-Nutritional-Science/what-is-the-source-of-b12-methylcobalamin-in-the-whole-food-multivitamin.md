# What is the source of B12 (Methylcobalamin) in the Whole Food Multivitamin?

The B12 (methylcobalamin) in our Whole Food Multivitamin is derived from cyanocobalamin through a process using sodium borohydride. Similarly, our folate (5-methyltetrahydrofolate) originates from folic acid. This ensures superior bioavailability.
