# Who is Dr. Berg's Doctor? Metabolomics Discussion

Please help me welcome a very special guest, Dr. Tsoukalas. We’re going to discuss a new topic that I’m very interested in—we’re talking about metabolomics. I haven’t shared my thoughts on this topic yet, but I believe it’s the future of medicine. Dr. Tsoukalas is my trusted doctor; he has evaluated my family and myself. He is very knowledgeable on the topic of metabolomics and trains doctors in this area. Today, he will share some of his knowledge with us and help us understand this new, incredible wave of the future.
