# Should polyarthritis and gout be treated using the same approach, or are there specific treatments and management strategies tailored to each condition?

Polyarthritis and gout require different treatments. Gout is caused by a buildup of uric acid, often due to the kidneys' inability to excrete it, typically affecting the big toe. It involves uric acid, a potent antioxidant linked to heart disease risk. A video discussing new insights on gout management will be released soon.

Polyarthritis, affecting multiple joints, can result from autoimmune conditions or osteoarthritis, among other causes. To manage inflammation generally, reduce omega-6 fatty acids in your diet, increase omega-3 fatty acids, and take more vitamin D3.
