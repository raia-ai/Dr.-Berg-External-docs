# Can gallbladder problems cause fat malabsorption?

Yes, gallbladder problems can lead to fat malabsorption. Issues such as gallstones or gallbladder inflammation can hinder bile release, resulting in poor digestion of fats and inadequate absorption of fat-soluble nutrients, leading to digestive issues such as diarrhea, pale stools, and bloating.
