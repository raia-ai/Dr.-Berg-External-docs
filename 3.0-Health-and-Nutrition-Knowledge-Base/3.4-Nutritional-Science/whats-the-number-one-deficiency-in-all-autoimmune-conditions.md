# What's the number one deficiency in all autoimmune conditions?

The most common deficiency in autoimmune conditions is vitamin D. Many people with autoimmune diseases benefit from the Coimbra protocol, which involves high doses of vitamin D and monitoring parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels to regulate calcium absorption.

Vitamin D resistance, where the body doesn't absorb vitamin D effectively, can lead to deficiencies despite normal blood levels. High PTH and low vitamin D levels suggest resistance. The solution is to increase vitamin D intake until PTH normalizes.

Factors contributing to vitamin D resistance include low sun exposure, darker skin, age, stress, location, and air pollution. Pathogens, heavy metals, and cancer can also downgrade vitamin D receptors. Adequate magnesium, zinc, and vitamin K2 are essential for proper calcium management and overall health.
