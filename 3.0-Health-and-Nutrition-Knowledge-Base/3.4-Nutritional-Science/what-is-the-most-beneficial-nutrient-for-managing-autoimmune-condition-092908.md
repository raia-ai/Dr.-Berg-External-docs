# What is the most beneficial nutrient for managing autoimmune conditions, and how does it support immune system regulation and overall health?

**Vitamin D and Autoimmune Disease: Dr. Coimbra's Insights**

According to Dr. Coimbra, patients with autoimmune diseases often have increased resistance to vitamin D, requiring higher doses than the average person. While general recommendations suggest 600 IU/day, some sources advocate for up to 10,000 IU/day safely.

**Key Points:**

\- Vitamin D acts as an immune regulator and reduces inflammation.

\- Resistance to vitamin D increases the risk of autoimmune diseases and other conditions.

**Causes of Vitamin D Resistance:**

\- Vitamin D polymorphism

\- Darker skin

\- Metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance

\- Obesity

\- Age

\- Lack of dietary vitamin D

\- Lack of sun exposure

**Coimbra Protocol:**

\- Dosage: 40,000 to 200,000 IU/day, guided by parathyroid hormone levels.

\- Avoid calcium and drink 2.5 liters of fluid daily to prevent hypercalcemia.

\- Consult a doctor experienced with the Coimbra protocol for proper guidance.

**Conclusion:**

Higher vitamin D doses may be necessary for autoimmune patients, but professional supervision is crucial.
