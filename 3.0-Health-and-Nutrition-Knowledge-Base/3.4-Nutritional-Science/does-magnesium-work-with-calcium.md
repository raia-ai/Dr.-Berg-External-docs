# Does magnesium work with calcium?

Magnesium plays a critical role in regulating calcium and maintaining proper muscle and nerve function.  

Here's how magnesium influences calcium and overall muscle health:

- **Calcium Channel Regulation:** Magnesium helps control the flow of calcium ions in and out of cells, including muscle cells. If magnesium levels are low, calcium can flood into the cells, leading to overstimulation and muscle contractions (like eye twitching).  

- **Parathyroid Hormone Regulation:** Magnesium is needed for the proper function of the parathyroid glands, which regulate calcium levels in the blood. Low magnesium may lead to impaired parathyroid function, potentially contributing to calcium imbalances.  

- **Muscle Relaxation:** Magnesium acts as a natural muscle relaxant, helping to counterbalance the stimulating effects of calcium. Adequate magnesium levels promote smooth muscle function and reduce the likelihood of spasms and twitches.  

If you suspect a magnesium deficiency, it's important to consult with your doctor to discuss appropriate supplementation.
