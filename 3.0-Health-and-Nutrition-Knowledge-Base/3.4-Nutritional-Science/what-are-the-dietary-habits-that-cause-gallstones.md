# What are the dietary habits that cause gallstones?

## **Dietary Habits Leading to Gallstone Formation**

Regarding gallstones, the food you eat plays a crucial role. Contrary to popular belief, certain dietary habits contribute more to gallstone formation than fat consumption.

Eating too many grains and sugars can cause a spike in insulin, resulting in depleted bile stores and thus raising the possibility of gallstone formation.

### **Impact of Grains on Insulin Levels**

The impact that grains have on our bodies is often underestimated. They are broken down into glucose during digestion, which then causes your blood sugar levels to rise rapidly.

This triggers your pancreas to release insulin - a hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels by facilitating glucose absorption into cells. However, consuming large amounts of grains regularly leads our body into a state known as insulin resistance.

In this condition, our cells become less responsive or resistant to insulin, making them unable to absorb glucose efficiently, causing high blood sugar and elevated insulin levels in the bloodstream.

This chronic elevation in insulin level is harmful to overall health and contributes significantly towards the depletion of bile reserves, thus paving the way for potential gallstone formation.

### **Sugar Consumption and Gallstone Formation**

Sugar consumption is not only linked to numerous health issues but also potentially gallstone formation. While sugar's relationship with gallstones isn't widely discussed, it is equally concerning.

- **Increase in Insulin Levels:** Like grains, excessive intake of sugars, significantly refined ones like white table sugar or high fructose corn syrup, causes rapid spikes in blood glucose, triggering an increased insulin secretion from the pancreas, resulting in higher circulating levels over time. This heightened level depletes bile, making one susceptible to forming stones within the gallbladder.

- **Promotes Weight Gain:** High consumption of sugars, particularly those found within processed foods, often leads to weight gain due to their empty calorie content devoid of any substantial nutrients yet packed full of energy (calories). Being overweight or obese increases the likelihood of developing cholelithiasis (gallstones).

**Tips To Minimize the Risk Of Gallstones Through Diet**

1. Avoid consuming excess carbohydrates straightforward carbs like sugary drinks, sweets, etc. Opt instead for low-carb foods rich in healthy fats to provide a steady energy supply without causing drastic fluctuations in your blood sugar and insulin levels.

2. Maintain a healthy weight through a nutritious low-carb diet like Healthy Keto. Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of cholesterol stones, the most common type of stone seen in patients suffering from this ailment. Losing even a small amount of weight, if overweight or obese, could potentially reduce the chances of getting affected by this painful condition.
