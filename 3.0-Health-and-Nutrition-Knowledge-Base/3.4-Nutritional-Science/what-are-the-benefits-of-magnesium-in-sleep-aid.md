# What are the benefits of magnesium in Sleep Aid?

**Magnesium Stearate (Vegetable Source)** 

Magnesium stearate is a common additive in supplements, primarily used as a "flow agent" or lubricant.   

- **Easier to swallow:** Magnesium stearate's lubricating properties make capsules or tablets easier to swallow.  

- **Lubricant and Flow Agent:** Magnesium stearate reduces friction between particles, preventing them from sticking to each other and the machinery during manufacturing.

- **Anti-Adherent:** It prevents ingredients from adhering to manufacturing equipment, making the process smoother and more efficient.    

- **Safety:** Magnesium stearate is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA.
