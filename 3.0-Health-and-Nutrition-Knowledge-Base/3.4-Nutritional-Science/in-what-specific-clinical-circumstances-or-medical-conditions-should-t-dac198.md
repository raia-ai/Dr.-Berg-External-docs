# In what specific clinical circumstances or medical conditions should the use of bile salts be contraindicated due to potential adverse effects?

Most people need bile salts. Usually, they’re not producing enough. 

**What are bile salts?** Bile salts are made by the liver and are stored in the gallbladder. When the gallbladder stores the bile salts, it concentrates them. Bile is a super-concentrated mixture to help break down fats so you can extract fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids from your food.

We make about a quart of bile every day, and 90% of the bile is recycled. There are many benefits of bile. It is also necessary to help a person detoxify chemicals. You can take purified bile salts to help digest fats and prevent gallstones. 

**When not to take bile salts:**

1\. If you have diarrhea 

2\. If you have a hyperthyroid condition

3\. If you have bile malabsorption 

**What to do if you’re body is making too much bile, or you have too much bile:**

• Lower the amount of fats in your diet to about 60g per day (not any lower)
