# Is cayenne pepper more effective than baby aspirin for thinning the blood, and if so, what is the recommended daily dosage for cayenne pepper?

**You know, everyone is told that baby aspirin is everyone needs to do it because it's normal. And recently there's some data that says that not everyone should do it. And it comes with the package. So my whole viewpoint is that if you do your research and you find that there are problems with aspirin, then you're looking for alternatives. You might want to try other things that could potentially help you.**

Cayenne pepper, different peppers, different remedies, different phytonutrients in certain plant compounds. Willow bark. You also have stinging nettle root.

There's so many different things you can take. So I would just research several of them to see if any of them can actually come close to creating the effect that you want to do without the side effects. All right.
