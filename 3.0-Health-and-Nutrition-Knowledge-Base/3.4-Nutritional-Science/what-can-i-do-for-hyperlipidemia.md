# What can I do for hyperlipidemia?

There's some natural things that you can do, for sure. Vitamin B3 in the form of niacin would be very potent. The other thing would be very potent that acts like statin, but with less side effects is the red yeast extract, very beneficial. You can also do natokinase, which will also help lower your cholesterol, and even sometimes the TUDCA can do it as well.
