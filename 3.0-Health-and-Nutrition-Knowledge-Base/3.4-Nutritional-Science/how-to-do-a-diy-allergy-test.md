# How to do a DIY allergy test?

This is primarily for food allergies that you can't quite determine. 

During an allergic reaction, your pulse increases. A pulse oximeter is a great tool to help you check your pulse easily, but you can also check your pulse using your wrist or carotid artery. 

How to do a DIY allergy test: 

1\. Check and record your pulse rate:

• In the morning, before getting out of bed

• Before eating

• 30 minutes after eating

• 30 minutes after that 

• 30 minutes after that 

• Before bed

2\. Record what you ate next to your pulse rate 

Typically, you could have an allergy if there is a difference between the low and high pulse rates above 16 points. The pulse rate also needs to be above 84.  If you react to a meal, use this test over a few days, eliminating foods one at a time to help you isolate which ingredient is causing a problem.
