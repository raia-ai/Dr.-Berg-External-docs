# What foods should I avoid if I have herpes?

**Understanding Herpes and Your Diet**

Herpes (type 1 or 2) can be influenced by diet. The goal is to limit foods high in arginine (an amino acid the virus uses) and increase foods high in lysine (which may help suppress outbreaks).

**Foods to Limit or Avoid:**

- **Nuts & Seeds:** Almonds, peanuts, cashews, etc.

- **Berries:** Raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, etc.

- **Grains:** Wheat, oats, rice, etc.

- **Beans & Legumes**

- **Tofu**

- **Gelatin**

- **Eggs**

**Foods to Enjoy:**

- **Meat & Seafood:** Fish, chicken, beef, lamb, etc.

- **Cheese**

- **Vegetables**

- **Sprouts**

**Managing Outbreaks and Prevention:**

- **Take L-Lysine:** If you must eat high-arginine foods, consider taking L-lysine simultaneously. 3,000mg may be helpful during an intense outbreak, otherwise smaller doses for prevention.

- **Manage Other Triggers:** Stress, excessive sun exposure, and a weakened immune system can all contribute to outbreaks.

**Important Note:** Around 95% of adults carry the herpes virus. It can go in and out of remission. Dietary changes may help manage outbreaks, but it's important to understand the broader picture of this common virus.
