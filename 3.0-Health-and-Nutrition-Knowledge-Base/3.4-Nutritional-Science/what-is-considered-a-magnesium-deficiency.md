# What is considered a magnesium deficiency?

A magnesium deficiency is typically diagnosed when magnesium serum levels are below 1.3 mg per deciliter.   

It’s important to remember that blood magnesium levels don’t accurately reflect overall body stores, and it’s best to evaluate magnesium status based on deficiency symptoms and risk factors of hypomagnesemia.
