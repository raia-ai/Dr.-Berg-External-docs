# Why doesn't the label say the Turmeric Curcumin with Bioperine is organic?

We've updated our label for our Turmeric Curcumin with Bioperine to comply with FDA regulations. Rest assured, our turmeric ingredient remains organic, even though the word 'organic' is no longer on the supplement panel. You'll see the updated label on our shop soon.
