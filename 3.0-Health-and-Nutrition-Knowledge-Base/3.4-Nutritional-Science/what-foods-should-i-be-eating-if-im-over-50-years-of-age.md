# What foods should I be eating if I'm over 50 years of age?

Dr. David Sinclair, an expert on longevity, has researched longevity genes called sirtuins. NAD can increase sirtuins! NAD is derived from niacin. It works inside your mitochondria, converting food to energy. As we age, our NAD decreases. Many people take supplements and get injections to boost NAD.

Dr. Abram Hoffer wrote a book about the diseases caused by too little niacin and how many diseases can be cured with mega doses. He’s one of the doctors who started the Orthomolecular Medicine Group, which used high doses of nutrients to create therapeutic dosages.

The following foods can increase NAD and should be part of a healthy diet for people over 50:

1\. Beef liver

2\. Grass-fed red meat

3\. Probiotic-rich foods—raw sauerkraut, yogurt

4\. Parsley (celery or chamomile tea can also work)

5\. Curcumin—turmeric

6\. Quercetin—onions

7\. Omega-3 fatty acids—wild-caught fatty fish, cod liver

Sulforaphane, found in cruciferous vegetables, is also beneficial for healthy aging. Broccoli sprouts and radish sprouts are great to add to salads! Anthocyanins, found in blue and purple foods like blueberries, blackberries, and purple cabbage, are also good for anti-aging.
