# What factors related to the menstrual cycle may contribute to hair loss?

On day 15, when you’re ovulating, you get a huge spike in estrogen. In the next two weeks, you’re going to get a huge spike in progesterone and androgens.

The time of the month you’re losing your hair can give us clues as to which hormone is involved. Most women tend to lose hair during the second half of the menstrual cycle when there is a spike in androgens. But, even a female in menopause may continue to lose their hair to some degree.

**If you’re pre-menopause** and you’re experiencing hair loss in the second half of your cycle, you may need to lower your androgens. The best way to lower your androgens is to lower your insulin. You can lower your insulin by lowering your carbohydrates. You would want to go on the Healthy keto diet and do intermittent fasting.

**If you’re post-menopausal** and your hair is falling out, you may be low in progesterone, androgens, and estrogen. In this situation, taking DHEA may be beneficial. But be sure to only take a small amount (10-30mg a day), or it may have an opposite effect causing hair loss.

What if you’re postpartum and you’re experiencing hair loss because of a severe drop in estrogen? In this case, 10mg of DHEA may help. For PCOS, your androgens are too high. In this situation, you could try doing keto and intermittent fasting, as well as taking inositol.

For a heavy period, you would not want to take DHEA. Instead, you can try taking DIM and get plenty of iron. It’s possible to have a slow thyroid because of an increase in estrogen. In this situation, DIM may be beneficial as well as bile salts and selenium.

If you’re losing your hair after you stopped taking birth control pills, this could be from a decrease in estrogen. Taking inositol may be a great remedy in this case.

**Two additional causes of hair loss to keep in mind are:**

1\. A trace mineral deficiency

2\. A B vitamin deficiency
