# Which specific foods should individuals with diabetes avoid to effectively manage their condition, and what are the underlying reasons for these dietary restrictions?

Diabetics should avoid high-carb and sugary foods such as refined grains, sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, and processed snacks. In addition, itâ€™s recommended to limit starches, such as white rice, flour, pasta, bread, and crackers, as these foods cause rapid blood sugar spikes, which contribute to insulin resistance and diabetes.
