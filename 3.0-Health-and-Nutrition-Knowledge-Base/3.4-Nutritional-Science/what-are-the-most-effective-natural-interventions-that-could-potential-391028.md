# What are the most effective natural interventions that could potentially reverse or slow down the progression of premature graying of hair?

It’s natural for your hair to turn gray with age. However, many people are getting gray hair way too early. Even though you may have genes that give you the propensity to get gray hair, there are still things you can do to help prevent your hair from graying prematurely.

The pigment in your hair and the enzymes that allow the pigment to occur are both dependent on copper. You could be deficient in copper from not consuming foods high in copper. High levels of stress can also cause a copper deficiency. It’s important to do whatever you can to decrease stress and increase copper to prevent gray hair. It may be best to get the copper you need from foods rich in copper rather than a supplement.

As you age, you accumulate hydrogen peroxide in the hair shaft. Hydrogen peroxide can cause a bleaching effect on the hair. To slow this accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, you can try consuming foods rich in catalase.
