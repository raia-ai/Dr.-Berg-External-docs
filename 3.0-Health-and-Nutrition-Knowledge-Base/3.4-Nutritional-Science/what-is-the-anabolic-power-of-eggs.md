# What is the anabolic power of eggs?

Eggs are a premier protein source, excelling in muscle growth and tissue development. Their protein is highly digestible and effective for muscle protein synthesis, surpassing other protein sources in anabolic potential.

Comparative Anabolic Effects:

\- Eggs: 48% anabolic effect

\- Meat, Fish, Poultry: 32% anabolic effect

\- Egg Whites: 17% anabolic effect

\- Soy and Dairy/Whey: 17% and 16% anabolic effect, respectively

\- Spirulina: 6% anabolic effect

Eggs offer superior muscle-building benefits, with whole eggs being far more effective than just the whites.
