## **The Role of Cortisol in Morning Hunger**

[Cortisol, often called the "stress hormone,"](https://www.drberg.com/blog/cortisol-extremely-simplified-by-dr-berg) plays a significant role in morning hunger while fasting and doing keto. When you wake up, cortisol levels experience a significant spike.

This spike is not just a tiny increase; it's more like a high jump athlete clearing the bar. The reason this matters is that when cortisol levels rise, it also leads to an increase in glucose (sugar) levels in the body.

This rise in blood sugar is the body's way of ensuring that you have enough energy to start your day.

However, for individuals [following a ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-start-keto-correctly) or [practicing intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/my-1-best-intermittent-fasting-tips-for-faster-weight-loss-dr-berg), this increase in blood sugar can also trigger the brain to signal hunger, even if you're not hungry.

Grasping the intricate interplay of hormones is vital for those tackling unwelcome morning cravings as they commit to their nutritional objectives.

So, the next time you feel your stomach growling before breakfast while on keto or during a fasting period, remember that cortisol may be playing a role in your morning routine.
