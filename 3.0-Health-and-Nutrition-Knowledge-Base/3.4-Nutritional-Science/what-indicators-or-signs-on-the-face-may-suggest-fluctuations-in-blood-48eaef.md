# What indicators or signs on the face may suggest fluctuations in blood sugar levels, and how can these manifestations relate to overall metabolic health?

**7 things your face says about your health:**

1\. Face Shape: A round face may indicate high insulin levels and excess carb consumption, leading to water retention.

2\. Tissue Around the Eyes: Puffiness can suggest kidney issues due to fluid retention.

3\. Eyes: Bloodshot eyes may signal liver problems or a deficiency in vitamins B2 and B3.

4\. Under the Chin: Fat in this area could indicate accumulated fat and may be linked to sleep apnea.

5\. Skin Texture: Oily skin may point to a zinc deficiency or high androgens due to high insulin.

6\. Dry, Flaky Skin: This can be related to liver issues or excessive omega-6 fatty acids; cod liver oil may help.

7\. Acne: Often linked to high androgens or insulin; zinc and dietary changes may help.
