# What are the primary causes of receding gums, and how do these factors contribute to gum health and overall oral hygiene?

Receding gums could actually be caused by a vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C has a lot to do with protein building, specifically collagen. When you lose collagen, your gums can start to recede. 

Some bacteria have a negative effect through enzymes that break down protein. But, vitamin C can counter the effect of these enzymes. Vitamin C can help reduce the toxic effect of bacteria.  If you brush your teeth and your gums bleed easily, this could be because of a vitamin C deficiency. 

**Vitamin C deficiency causes:**

• You could have high levels of insulin 

• You’re taking certain antibiotics 

• You’re not getting enough vitamin C from your diet
