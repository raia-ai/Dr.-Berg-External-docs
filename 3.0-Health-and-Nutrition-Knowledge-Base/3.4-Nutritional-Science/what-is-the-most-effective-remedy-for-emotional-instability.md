# What is the most effective remedy for emotional instability?

**Vitamin B1 deficiency** can lead to emotional instability and delirium, particularly affecting brain regions like the hippocampus, amygdala, and mammillary bodies. It's crucial to maintain adequate intake of B1, as it's water-soluble and not stored in large amounts by the body. Higher carbohydrate or sugar consumption increases the body's need for vitamin B1. Consulting with a doctor before altering your diet or starting supplements is advisable, especially for those with existing health conditions.
