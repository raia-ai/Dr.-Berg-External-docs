# What are the most effective ways to lose belly fat?

Diets don’t work for belly fat. Why? Because it’s not a weight problem, it’s actually a hormone problem. It’s a cortisol problem. Diets don’t lower cortisol, they lower calories.  You also do not want to overtrain.

Exercise is a type of stress that can aggravate the belly. Instead of intense exercise, try going on long walks. 

Cortisol is a hormone from the adrenals. It’s triggered by all kinds of stress. 

**How to lose belly fat fast:**

• Minimize stress

• Sleep (Take Adrenal & Cortisol Support, try acupressure)
