# Can I diagnose magnesium deficiency with a blood test?

Magnesium deficiency is notoriously difficult to diagnose accurately. Only about 1% of the body's magnesium is present in the blood, while the majority is stored within cells, bones, and muscles.

Therefore, standard blood tests, which measure serum magnesium levels, often fail to reflect an individual's true magnesium status. Even if blood levels appear normal, a person may still be deficient at the cellular level.

This difficulty in assessment leads to a significant underdiagnosis of magnesium deficiency, even though it is believed to be quite prevalent.
