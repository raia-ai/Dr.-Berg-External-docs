# What are the best dietary tips for managing hypothyroidism?

Tip #1 - Don’t go on a low-calorie diet. Why? Because you also lower your nutrition, which starves the metabolism. Low-calorie diets end up slowing down your thyroid even more. You need plenty of nutrients, so don’t starve your body.

Tip #2 - Avoid pre-packaged foods. Most pre-packaged foods contain something called soy protein isolates. What are these? They are a very low-quality protein that interferes with the thyroid and the liver. These are not good for the body. Avoid soy at all costs

Tip #3 - Avoid stimulates. This includes things like phentermine and diet pills. When the thyroid is stimulated, you run the risk of burning it out down the road. Stay away from stimulates like these.
