# What brand of AHCC- Shitake Extract does Dr. Berg Recommend?

Dr. Berg does not sell AHCC or provide specific brand recommendations for it. However, Active Hexose Correlated Compound (AHCC) is a supplement derived from mushroom mycelia with various proposed benefits.

**Potential Benefits of AHCC:**

- **Immune System Enhancement:** AHCC is known for its ability to enhance the activity of natural killer (NK) cells, which are crucial components of the immune system. It may also benefit individuals with a compromised immune system.

- **Antiviral Properties:** Research suggests AHCC may be beneficial for individuals with HPV (Human Papillomavirus).

- **Anti-inflammatory Effects:** AHCC has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties.

- **Stress Adaptation:** It may help improve the autonomic nervous system's ability to adapt to and recover from stress.

**Best Guidance for Purchasing AHCC:**

When considering purchasing AHCC, here are some best practices to follow without focusing on specific brands:

1. **Verify Authenticity:** AHCC is a proprietary ingredient. Look for products that explicitly state they contain genuine AHCC from a reputable manufacturer. Some manufacturers will list their distributors or provide information on how to identify authentic products. Be cautious of generic "mushroom extracts" claiming similar benefits without specifying "AHCC."

2. **Look for Standardized Extracts:** High-quality AHCC supplements are typically standardized to contain a certain percentage of their active compounds, such as alpha-glucans. This ensures consistency and potency across batches.

3. **Check for Third-Party Testing and Certifications:** As with any supplement, prioritize products that have undergone third-party testing for purity, potency, and contaminants. Certifications from organizations like NSF International, USP, or ConsumerLab indicate adherence to quality standards.

4. **Research the Manufacturer's Reputation:** Opt for companies with a long-standing reputation for quality control, good manufacturing practices (GMP), and transparent sourcing. Online reviews and independent supplement guides can sometimes offer insights into a manufacturer's reliability.

5. **Consider Dosage and Form:** AHCC is commonly available in capsules or powder. Check the dosage per serving to ensure it aligns with typical research dosages (often ranging from 1 to 3 grams per day, depending on the intended use).

6. **Review Ingredients:** Ensure the product's ingredient list is straightforward, primarily containing AHCC and minimal unnecessary fillers or artificial additives.

7. **Storage Information:** Note any specific storage recommendations to maintain the product's efficacy.
