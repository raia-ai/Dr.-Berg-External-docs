# CS- New and Improved Niacin 8/25

We have updated the Niacin from 500 mg per capsule to 125 mg of Niacin per capsule. We adjusted the formula because some customers had difficulty tolerating the full 500 mg dose at once. The new version splits the 500 mg into four capsules. Users can begin with one capsule per day and gradually increase to four capsules daily, based on their tolerance. Temporary flushing may occur during this process.

 Benefits:

- Potent source of niacin, a superior form of Vitamin B3.

- Promotes a healthy heart, balance cholesterol levels, and energy production.

**Talking points**

- **Why did we make a change to our Niacin product? Suggested phrases below**

    - **Talking point #1**

        - ***We have reduced the amount of niacin in each capsule due to feedback indicating that 500 mg was too high for beginners. Each capsule now contains 125 mg of niacin. We recommend starting with one capsule and gradually working your way up to four capsules per day, as you feel comfortable.***

    - **Talking point #2**

        - ***We've listened to your feedback, and to make it more suitable for your needs, we've lowered the niacin dosage in each capsule. Now, each one contains 125 mg—perfect for those just starting out! We suggest beginning with one capsule and then gradually working your way up to four a day, depending on how you’re feeling. Enjoy your journey to better health!***

- **Servings per container is 25. The previous bottle has 100 servings, but both are at the same price of $16.99**

    - ***Talking point***

        - ***We want to assure you that even though our serving sizes have changed, the price will remain the same. This allows us to continue providing the exceptional quality and freshness you expect, without compromising on our ingredients. Your feedback on niacin is greatly valued!***
