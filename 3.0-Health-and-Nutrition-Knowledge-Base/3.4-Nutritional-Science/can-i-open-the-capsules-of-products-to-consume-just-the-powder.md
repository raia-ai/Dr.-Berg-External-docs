# Can I open the capsules of products to consume just the powder?

We at Dr. Berg Nutritionals can only suggest following the recommended usage listed on the product. Our products have been tested for safety and efficacy based on this usage. While this does not mean the product is unsafe or ineffective outside the capsule, we do not have data regarding its use outside the suggested usage. Using the product in a manner inconsistent with the suggested usage is at your discretion and should only be done under medical supervision.

We truly appreciate your understanding. Please know that your health and safety are our utmost priorities, and we are committed to ensuring they remain at the forefront of our efforts.
