# Do I have to consult a physician before taking a supplement?

Consulting with a healthcare provider is not required before starting a supplement. However, we strongly encourage you to do so, especially if you have a known medical condition. This includes anyone taking a medication, as some supplements will interact with medications. Please consult your prescribing doctor and/or pharmacist before starting supplementation.
Additionally, pregnant or nursing mothers and children under the age of 18 are strongly encouraged to consult with a physician before supplement use.
