# What are the most important benefits of calcium?

Most people associate calcium with bone health. However, it has numerous other functions that are essential for a healthy body. The number one function of calcium is intercellular communication. What this means is that it helps with the communication between cells. When you don't have enough calcium outside your cells and too much calcium inside your cells, this is a problem called intercellular hypercalcinosis. This is caused by not enough calcium.

**When this happens, you can develop problems, including:**

• Hypertension

• Hardening arteries

• Diabetes

• Cancer

• Inflammation

• Soft tissue calcium

Calcium also controls natural cell death - called apoptosis. A problem with this can trigger tumors. The main reasons for low calcium could be a deficiency in Vitamin D3, Vitamin K2, Omega3, and Magnesium. These help transport, absorb, or regulate calcium.

Avoid calcium carbonate. This form of calcium is not beneficial for increasing calcium levels.
