# Niacin and Cellular Health

Niacin (Vitamin B3) plays a significant role in supporting cellular health through its involvement in several key biological processes:

---

### **1\. Role in Cellular Energy and Health**

- **NAD+ Production**: Niacin is essential for synthesizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a coenzyme critical for energy production in cells. NAD+ supports mitochondrial function, which is vital for maintaining cellular energy and preventing premature cell aging.

---

### **2\. One-Carbon Metabolism**

- **DNA Methylation**: Niacin indirectly helps contribute to methylation cycles by ensuring sufficient energy (through NAD+) for pathways, including the synthesis of SAMe (S-adenosylmethionine), a critical methyl donor in one-carbon metabolism. Proper methylation impacts gene expression, DNA repair, and cellular functions.

### **3\. Telomere Health**

- **Cell Longevity**: NAD+ has been linked to maintaining and potentially repairing telomeres, the protective caps on chromosomes. Healthier telomeres can slow aging-related cellular damage.

---

### **4\. Cancer Prevention**

- **DNA Repair and Anti-Inflammation**: Niacin and NAD+ are crucial for DNA repair enzymes (like PARPs), which help fix damaged DNA, potentially reducing cancer risk. Niacin also helps regulate inflammation, which, when excessive, is a known risk factor for cancer.

---

### **5\. Antioxidant Defense**

- **Reducing Oxidative Stress**: By supporting energy pathways and enzyme systems, niacin may help reduce oxidative stress, a factor in cellular damage and aging-related diseases.

Niacin is vital for mitochondrial function, DNA repair, and inflammation for overall cellular health.
