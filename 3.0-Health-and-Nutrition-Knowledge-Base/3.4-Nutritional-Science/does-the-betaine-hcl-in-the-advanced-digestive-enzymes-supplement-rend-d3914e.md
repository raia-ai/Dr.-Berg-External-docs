# Does the Betaine HCL in the Advanced Digestive Enzymes supplement render the enzymes to become inactive and if not, what in the formula ensures the enzymes will not become inactive?

Betaine HCL is an enzyme itself and does not render other enzymes inactive. I am not sure why that is being asked. Betaine HCL helps the body release bile to break down fats and even helps the pancrease release enzymes to help break down food.
