# How can one enhance the bioavailability of iron from dietary sources?

There are two types of iron: heme iron and non-heme iron. Heme iron comes from animal sources and non-heme iron comes from plant sources. Non-heme iron is not absorbed by the body as well as heme iron.

Consuming foods high in vitamin C alongside iron can help increase iron absorption. It’s best to consume foods with vitamin C, rather than synthetic forms of vitamin C like those found in vitamin C supplements. Some of the best sources of vitamin C are lemons, berries, and bell peppers.

Vitamin C is especially important if you’re getting your iron from plant sources. Avoid synthetic sources of iron like ferric oxide and ferric hydroxide.
