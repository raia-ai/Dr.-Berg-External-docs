# What is shilajit, and what are its key components, traditional uses, and potential health benefits as a natural supplement?

Shilajit is a natural substance found primarily in the rocks of the Himalayan mountains. Shilajit contains over 84 minerals, including fulvic acid, dibenzo-alpha-pyrones, humic acid, fatty acids, amino acids, and other organic compounds. It has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine as a rejuvenator and anti-aging compound. Some potential benefits of shilajit include:

- Boosting energy and reducing fatigue

- Enhancing cognitive function

- Supporting the immune system

- Improving cardiovascular health

- Potentially aiding in the management of diabetes

While Dr. Berg does not have a video or resources with information on shilajit, he does have a video on fulvic acid, one of the many organic compounds found in shilajit.
