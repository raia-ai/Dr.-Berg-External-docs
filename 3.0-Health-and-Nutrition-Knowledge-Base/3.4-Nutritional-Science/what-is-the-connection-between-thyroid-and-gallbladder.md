# What is the connection between thyroid and gallbladder?

Bile contains bile salts, lecithin, bilirubin, protein, and cholesterol. If a person has too much cholesterol and not enough bile salts, they could develop gallstones. However, cholesterol is necessary to help you make bile, hormones, and vitamin D. The body makes the majority of cholesterol in the body.

The liver makes bile. Bile helps eliminate excess cholesterol and certain toxins. It also helps break down fats and supports the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and fatty acids. A person with hypothyroidism or a subclinical hyperthyroid issue has an increased risk of gallstones. Many different connections cause this increased risk, but overall, it takes a healthy thyroid to make enough bile and bile to create a healthy thyroid.

Ultimately, I believe a lack of fat and cholesterol in the diet can increase your risk of gallstones and hypothyroidism from multiple angles. The Healthy KetoÂ® diet can help supply the fats and important vitamins and minerals your body needs. Learn more about Healthy Keto in my other videos.
