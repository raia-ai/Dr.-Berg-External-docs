# Why do I still have sweet cravings on Keto?

**Dr. Berg talks about ketosis and some people still crave sweets even when they start a ketogenic diet.**

1\. You may be in the transition phase and it's going to take more time.

2\. You may need more potassium (this stabilizes blood sugars)

3\. If you enjoy chocolate, consume sugar-free always.

4\. If you crave bread - it means you need more B vitamins (nutritional yeast)

5\. Liver - your liver may be damaged due to many things and this alone can block ketosis.
