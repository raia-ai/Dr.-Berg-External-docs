# Can Keto cause diarrhea?

Diarrhea on a ketogenic diet can occur for several reasons. One common cause is that your body may not be accustomed to digesting the higher levels of saturated fat required on keto. To address this, consider reducing your intake of oils such as MCT oil, butter, and coconut oil to see if symptoms improve.

Additionally, excessive consumption of certain vegetables can overwhelm gut microbes. It's advisable to stick to more easily digestible options like lettuce, cucumber, tomato, and bell pepper, gradually reintroducing other vegetables as your gut adapts. Incorporating fermented vegetables can also support gut health.

With time and appropriate dietary adjustments, diarrhea should subside as your body adapts to the ketogenic diet.
