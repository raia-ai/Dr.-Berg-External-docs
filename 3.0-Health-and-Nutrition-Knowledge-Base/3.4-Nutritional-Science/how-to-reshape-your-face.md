# How to Reshape Your Face

**High Cortisol and Moon Face: Understanding the Connection**

One of the most noticeable signs of Cushing's syndrome, a condition caused by elevated cortisol levels, is a "moon face." This facial fullness is due to fat redistribution triggered by chronically high cortisol. The medication Prednisone can also cause a similar effect.

**Cortisol's Impact on Your Body**

Cortisol not only shifts fat to your face and midsection, creating a hump on your back and red cheeks, but it also weakens your muscles and thins your legs. Internally, it can raise your cholesterol and lipids, disrupt your sodium and potassium balance, elevate your blood pressure, and compromise your immune system.

**The Insulin Connection**

High cortisol indirectly contributes to facial puffiness by converting protein into glucose. This elevates insulin levels, promoting fat storage and making fat loss more difficult. Factors like carb intake, frequent eating, certain oils, nutrient deficiencies, stress, overexercising, and medications can also trigger insulin.

**5 Strategies for a Leaner Face**

1. **Reduce Meal Frequency:** Implement intermittent fasting and avoid snacking to encourage your body to burn stored fat for energy.

2. **Dietary Changes:** Cut down on carbohydrates, especially sugar and starch. Refer to my card cutout for a list of ingredients to avoid.

3. **Boost Protein Intake:** Include high-quality, grass-fed meat like beef, lamb, or goat in your diet.

4. **Manage Stress:** Engage in activities that promote relaxation and well-being, such as walking, exercise, and physical work. Reduce time spent on your phone.

5. **Prioritize Sleep:** Ensure you're getting adequate sleep. If possible, even try to go back to sleep if you wake up early.
