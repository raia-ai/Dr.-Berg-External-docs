# What are some homemade keto-friendly rice cake alternatives?

If you're craving the crunch of rice cakes but want to keep your carb count low, consider making homemade alternatives using healthier ingredients.

For a savory option, blend mashed avocado with almond flour, salt, and seasonings, then bake until crispy. This provides a delicious, low-carb snack rich in healthy fats.

Alternatively, create coconut oil crackers by mixing melted coconut oil with ground flaxseed or chia seeds and your favorite spices. Bake until golden for a nutritious, keto-friendly treat that won't compromise your diet.
