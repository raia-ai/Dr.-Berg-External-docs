# What are the most effective methods for dissolving gallbladder stones and alleviating acid reflux symptoms?

To maintain gallbladder health and prevent stones, ensuring the correct ratio of bile salts to cholesterol is crucial. Supplementing with specific bile salts can help balance these ratios and potentially reduce stone severity. Additionally, TUDCA, another type of bile salt, can support bile flow and prevent sludge formation in the bile ducts. To enhance digestion and bile production, consider taking betaine hydrochloride to optimize stomach acid levels, which play a key role in stimulating bile release from the liver.
