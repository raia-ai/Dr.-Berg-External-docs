# What are the heart-healthy fats found in olives, and how do they contribute to cardiovascular health?

Olives are rich in healthy monounsaturated fats (MUFAs), especially oleic acid, which provides numerous health benefits, particularly for the heart.

**Oleic Acid and Anti-Inflammatory Properties**

Oleic acid, an omega-9 fatty acid, has potent anti-inflammatory effects. It helps combat chronic inflammation, which is linked to diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Research shows oleic acid can suppress cancer-related genes and enhance the effectiveness of certain cancer treatments.

**Monounsaturated Fats for Heart Health**

MUFAs in olives help improve cholesterol levels by lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol and increasing HDL (good) cholesterol, reducing heart disease risk. A study in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a diet rich in MUFAs from olive oil significantly reduced heart disease risk.

**Low-Carb Benefits**

Olives are low in carbohydrates, making them an excellent snack for low-carb or ketogenic diets.

Incorporating olives into your diet supports heart health, reduces inflammation, and fits well with low-carb eating plans.
