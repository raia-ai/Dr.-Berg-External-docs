# What brand of beef liver supplement does Dr. Berg recommend?

**Beef Liver Supplements: A Nutrient Powerhouse** 

While Dr. Berg doesn't have a specific brand recommendation for **beef liver supplements**, he emphasizes the importance of finding a product that is both **grass-fed and grass-finished**. This ensures you're getting the highest quality supplement with the most beneficial nutrient profile. 

Beef liver is truly a superfood, packed with an incredible array of vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients. It's an excellent natural source of: 

- **Vitamin A (Retinol):** Crucial for vision, immune function, and skin health. 

- **B Vitamins (especially B12, Folate, Riboflavin):** Vital for energy production, nerve function, and red blood cell formation. 

- **Iron (Heme Iron):** Highly bioavailable iron, important for oxygen transport and preventing anemia. 

- **Copper:** Essential for iron metabolism, energy production, and connective tissue. 

- **Choline:** Supports liver function, brain health, and metabolism. 

- **CoQ10:** An antioxidant important for cellular energy.  

**Best Practices for Buying Beef Liver Supplements:** 

When you're looking to purchase a beef liver supplement, here are the key recommendations to ensure you're getting a top-quality product: 

1. **Grass-Fed and Grass-Finished:** This is the most crucial factor. "Grass-fed" means the cattle ate grass for most of their lives, but "grass-finished" means they continued to eat grass right up until harvest. This ensures a superior nutrient profile and avoids grains that can impact the animal's health and the quality of the liver. 

2. **Desiccated (Freeze-Dried):** Look for supplements that are "desiccated" or "freeze-dried." This gentle drying process preserves the heat-sensitive vitamins, enzymes, and cofactors naturally found in raw liver, retaining its nutritional integrity. 

3. **No Fillers:** A high-quality beef liver supplement should contain only beef liver.  

4. **Non-GMO and Hormone-Free:** Ensure the product comes from animals not treated with hormones or antibiotics, and that their feed (if any, though grass-finished is ideal) is non-GMO. 

5. **Third-Party Tested:** Reputable brands will often have their products third-party tested for purity, potency, and to ensure they are free from heavy metals or other contaminants. Look for this information on the product label or the company's website. 

By focusing on these criteria, you can confidently choose a high-quality beef liver supplement to support your nutritional needs!
