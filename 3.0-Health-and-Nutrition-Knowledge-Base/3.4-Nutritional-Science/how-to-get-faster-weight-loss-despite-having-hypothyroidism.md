# How to get faster weight loss despite having hypothyroidism?

It’s a complex subject because there are different kinds of hypothyroidism such as Hashimoto’s and non-Hashimotos. Sometimes you can’t figure out what’s important and what’s trivial information. In this video, I focus on the most important things you need to know to achieve weight loss with a hypothyroid condition.

Your thyroid is located at the bottom of your neck. It produces a hormone called T4 which is an inactive thyroid hormone. T4 converts to T3 which is the active thyroid hormone. T3 goes into your cells and speeds up your metabolism as well as weight loss. 80 percent of conversion happens through your liver, 20 percent happens through your kidneys.

So many people with hypothyroid conditions have a fatty liver. If you have belly fat chances are you have a fatty liver, which decreases the capacity to convert T4 to T3. Your focus is to get the fat off your liver and improve its function. But it could also be a function of your gallbladder, or perhaps cirrhosis of your liver.

You’d think cutting fat from your diet would make the fat on your liver go away but that’s not what you want to do. You do need to cut carbs which is why I recommend keto and intermittent fasting.

As well, here are some things to speed up the process: Choline is one of the most powerful nutrients to strip fat from your liver very quickly. Get high quality choline and start taking it. It dissolves fat. Egg yolks have the highest amount of choline in a food. If you have a choline deficiency you could potentially get a fatty liver.

Selenium is also involved in the conversion of T4 to T3. It’s an antioxidant and is especially important if you have Hashimoto’s. Also, do more strict intermittent fasting to decrease inflammation and boost your immune system.

Iodine is part of the raw material to build thyroid hormones. I recommend consuming sea kelp as a source of iodine. Next is zinc which will help with almost every single side effect of being hypothyroid such as hair loss, fatigue, and constipation. It’s in oysters, meat, and pumpkin seeds, but I recommend taking a supplement. These are the steps you can take to get faster weight loss even with hypothyroidism.
