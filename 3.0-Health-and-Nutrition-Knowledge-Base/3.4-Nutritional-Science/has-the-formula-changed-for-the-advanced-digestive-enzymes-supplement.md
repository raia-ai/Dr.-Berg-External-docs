# Has the formula changed for the Advanced Digestive Enzymes supplement?

We've updated our Advanced Digestive Formula. It's now available in capsule form and no longer contains magnesium stearate, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, silicon dioxide, or stearic acid. However, you'll still get the same great digestive support.
