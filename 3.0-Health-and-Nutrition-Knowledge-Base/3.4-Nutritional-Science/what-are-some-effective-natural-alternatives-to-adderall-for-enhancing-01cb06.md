# What are some effective natural alternatives to Adderall for enhancing focus and cognitive function without the use of pharmaceuticals?

There is an interesting natural adderall alternative that has virtually no side effects. It’s called Mucuna Pruriens or velvet bean. Mucuna Pruriens increases L-dopa, which turns into dopamine (a body chemical that triggers feelings of pleasure).

**Benefits**

- Increases focus and concentration

- Decreases brain fog

- Increases ability to learn

- Increases memory

- Increases mood

- Decreases stress

- Neuroprotective

**How to consume it**

You may want to cycle consumption of this substance by taking it for four days in a row and then not taking it for three days in a row or so forth. Follow the directions on the label for the proper dosage.

If you are trying to substitute velvet bean for adderall, consult with your medical doctor prior to undertaking it.

It will work a lot better if you also correct your diet by doing Healthy Keto® and intermittent fasting. Mucuna pruriens may help with symptoms, but you really want to correct the root cause of brain fog and lack of focus by fixing your diet.

**Where to get it**

You can get it at a health food store or order it online.
