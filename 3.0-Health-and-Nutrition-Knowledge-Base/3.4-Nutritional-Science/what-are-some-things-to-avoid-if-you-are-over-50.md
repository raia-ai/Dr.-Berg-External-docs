# What are some things to avoid if you are over 50?

1\. Don’t take health advice from inexperienced people.

2\. Don’t be too quick to accept a diagnosis.

3\. Avoid solutions that create more problems.

4\. Avoid excessive stress.

The most important nutrient for people over 50 is vitamin D. Vitamin D influences 10% of your genes. You need at least 10,000 IU of vitamin D or more to produce a therapeutic effect. Doctors worldwide are using vitamin D3 for many health concerns, including autoimmune diseases, eye problems, and fibroids.

Magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D work together in a synergistic relationship. Magnesium is vital for heart health and energy. Avoid calcium and iron supplements as you age. It’s very difficult to rid the body of excess iron.

You don’t need to avoid salt! Opt for sea salt and make sure you’re getting plenty of potassium. Sodium deficiency can cause increased cortisol levels, which can interfere with sleep.

Cholesterol is an essential building block of sex hormones, so you must get enough after menopause. Cholesterol is essential for our brain, bile salts, and other hormones. Butter, eggs, dairy, and shellfish are the best dietary sources of cholesterol.

Focus on removing carbs from the diet and prioritizing quality protein. Grass-fed beef or lamb is the best source of protein.

Frequent eating stimulates insulin, which is the root cause of many chronic illnesses, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and a fatty liver.

Autoimmune diseases are related to low vitamin D and the microbes, viruses, and other pathogens that downgrade the vitamin D receptor. After severe stress or shock, your immune system becomes suppressed, leaving you vulnerable to autoimmune disease.
