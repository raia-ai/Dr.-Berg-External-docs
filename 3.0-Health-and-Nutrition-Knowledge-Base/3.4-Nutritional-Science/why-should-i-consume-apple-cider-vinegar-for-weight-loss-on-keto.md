# Why should I consume apple cider vinegar for weight loss on keto?

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is effective due to its acetic acid content. Acetic acid aids mineral absorption, mobilizes calcium, improves protein digestion, and boosts the immune system. ACV also helps improve blood sugar levels by increasing glucose sensitivity, leading to less insulin production and more fat burning.

Many people have overly alkaline blood pH. ACV, being acidic with a pH of 2.5, can slightly alter body pH, enhancing mineral transport, enzyme function, thyroid stimulation, and metabolism. It's also beneficial for stomach issues like heartburn, acid reflux, GERD, and indigestion, often caused by too alkaline conditions. As we age, our stomachs become more alkaline, so we need more acid.
