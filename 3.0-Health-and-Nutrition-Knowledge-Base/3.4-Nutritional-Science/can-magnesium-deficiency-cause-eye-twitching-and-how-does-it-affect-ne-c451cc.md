# Can magnesium deficiency cause eye twitching, and how does it affect neuromuscular function?

Magnesium plays a crucial role in muscle and nerve function.

When magnesium levels are low, your muscles and nerves can become overexcited, leading to involuntary muscle contractions or spasms. This can manifest as eye twitching, also known as eyelid myokymia.  

Magnesium helps regulate calcium levels, which are also important for muscle function. Low magnesium levels can lead to an influx of calcium into muscle cells, causing them to contract more easily. This can contribute to eye twitching and other muscle cramps and spasms.  

If you experience persistent eye twitching, you should speak to your healthcare professional for guidance on whether magnesium supplementation would be appropriate.
