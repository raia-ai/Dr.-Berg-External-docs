# The Low Magnesium Epidemic

Let’s talk about the benefits of magnesium and the dangers of magnesium deficiency.

A deficiency in magnesium could put you at risk for certain health concerns, such as:

• High blood pressure

• Arrhythmias

• Tetany or twitching

• Leg or foot cramps

• Fatigue

• Diabetes

• Insulin resistance

• Depression

• Inflammation

The RDAs for magnesium are 300 to 750 mg. But some people may need much higher amounts. It’s important to consume foods high in magnesium and avoid certain things that deplete magnesium.

Foods rich in magnesium are the ones high in chlorophyll, which would be green vegetables. The top things that deplete magnesium are sugar and refined carbohydrates.

Other things that can lead to a magnesium deficiency include:

• Diarrhea

• Diuretics

• Antibiotics

• Alcohol consumption

• Age

For a magnesium supplement, you have a few different good options, including:

• Magnesium citrate

• Magnesium lactate

• Magnesium glycinate

• Magnesium aspartate

• Magnesium gluconate

Magnesium is important for the absorption of vitamin D and B vitamins. It also helps support healthy cortisol levels, which can reduce stress and help you sleep better.
