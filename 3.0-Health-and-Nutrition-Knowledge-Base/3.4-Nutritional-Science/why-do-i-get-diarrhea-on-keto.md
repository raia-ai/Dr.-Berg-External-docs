# Why do I get diarrhea on Keto?

Why do you get diarrhea on keto? There are a few reasons, which I’ll explain. First, you may not be used to digesting the amount of saturated fat required on keto. Your body will produce more bile, which lubricates your colon. Cut back on your oil consumption, especially if it’s in a liquid form like MCT oil. Also, reduce the amount of butter and coconut oil you’re consuming. See if that helps.

A more likely reason is that you’re not used to digesting the quantity of vegetables I recommend. Certain compounds in some vegetables can overwhelm the microbes in your small intestine. Switch the type of vegetables you’re consuming to safe ones: lettuce, cucumber, tomato, zucchini, bell pepper, and bean sprouts.

For now, avoid consuming onions, garlic, artichokes, beetroot, leeks, Brussel sprouts, and cabbage. As well, temporarily avoid green beans, avocados, blackberries, cauliflower, mushrooms, and fennel. Stick with the safe vegetables I listed, and try consuming fermented vegetables.

As your microbes start multiplying and adapting to the safe vegetables, you’ll be able to gradually include more of the ones you were temporarily avoiding. Ease more of them in after three or four weeks. You should no longer get diarrhea on keto.
