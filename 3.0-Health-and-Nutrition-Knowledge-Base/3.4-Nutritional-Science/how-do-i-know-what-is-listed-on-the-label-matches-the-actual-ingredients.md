# How do I know what is listed on the label matches the actual ingredients?

Lab analysis is performed on all of our products to validate that the contents of a product match what is listed on the label. If you'd like to see the results for a specific product, we'd be happy to provide them upon request. We strive for complete transparency and prioritize clear labeling of our ingredients.
