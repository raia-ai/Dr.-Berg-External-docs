# What are some bad habits that can destroy my heart?

1\. Believing everything you read on labels

Food labels can be misleading. Even foods marketed as essential to a heart-healthy diet may have damaging health effects.

Avoiding the sun can lower your vitamin D levels. Vitamin D is one of the most important vitamins for supporting a healthy body, including cardiovascular health.

3\. Excessive sitting

A fascinating study shows a sedentary lifestyle may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.

4\. Overusing medication

Consider working with a doctor who is open to natural alternatives for various conditions.

5\. Snacking

Snacking before bed ruins your ability to burn fat while you sleep. Fat burning occurs mainly at night!

Drinking too much water while on a low-salt diet can dilute an important electrolyte: sodium.

Certain studies have found dental bacteria in arterial plaque. Tooth infections can also lead to health issues.

Nose breathing may help you sleep better at nightâ€”good sleep is vital for heart health.

10\. Feeling out of breath when exercising

Feeling out of breath very quickly when exercising could be a sign of a heart issue you should not ignore.
