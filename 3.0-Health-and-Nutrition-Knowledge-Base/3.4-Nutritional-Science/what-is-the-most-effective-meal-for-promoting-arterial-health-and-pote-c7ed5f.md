# What is the most effective meal for promoting arterial health and potentially reducing arterial plaque?

There is an interesting connection between your microbiome and your arteries. In mice studies, when the mice lack a healthy gut microbiome, they tend to develop a lot of inflammation. Inflammation in the arteries triggers a cascade of damaging effects. An overall imbalance of the microorganisms in the body can also lead to various problems in the arteries.

**One of the most important vitamins for the arteries is vitamin K2.** Vitamin K2 helps keep calcium buildup out of the arteries. The microbes in your gut have the ability to make vitamin K2, but fermented foods and fatty foods are also rich in vitamin K2. Keep in mind that vitamin K2 works better when taken with vitamin D3. For every 100 mcg of vitamin K2, consider taking 10,000 IU of vitamin D3.

Probiotics are crucial to support healthy arteries, and your friendly microbes are your natural probiotics. It’s important to support your microbiome and avoid sterile foods like pasteurized and over-processed foods.

**The best meal to clean out the arteries:**

• Brie cheese

• Fatty pork sausage

• Sauerkraut

Each of these foods is fermented and loaded with vitamin K2. Give them a try, and start adding other alive and fermented foods to your diet.
