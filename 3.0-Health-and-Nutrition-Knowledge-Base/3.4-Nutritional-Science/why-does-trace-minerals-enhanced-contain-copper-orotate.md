# Why does Trace Minerals Enhanced contain Copper orotate?

Orotic acid is a naturally occurring compound involved in the body's production of DNA and RNA. It acts as a precursor in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway, which is essential for creating the building blocks of these important molecules.

When orotic acid is combined with minerals (like magnesium orotate or copper orotate), it may enhance the absorption of those minerals. Some proponents suggest that orotate forms of minerals offer superior bioavailability compared to other forms.

Orotic acid is believed to have properties that allow it to readily cross cell membranes. This could potentially aid in the delivery of minerals to the cells where they are needed.
