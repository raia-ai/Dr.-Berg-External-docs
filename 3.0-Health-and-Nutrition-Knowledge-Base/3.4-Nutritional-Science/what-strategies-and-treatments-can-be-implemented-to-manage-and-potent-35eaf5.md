# What strategies and treatments can be implemented to manage and potentially improve glaucoma?

The condition can negatively affect the optic nerve due to pressure internally. I recommend using a Standard Process product called AC Carbamide - do a search on this or find a local healthcare practitioner who sells it.

If there is nerve damage, I recommend: Nerve Support Formula (do a search on it - these are fat-soluble B vitamins)..

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**
