# Which vitamin is most effective in managing migraines?

Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is particularly beneficial for managing migraines. It's important to note that over 50% of migraine cases have a genetic component, often related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria play a crucial role in energy production, and in individuals with migraines, these mitochondria may become dysfunctional, leading to hyper-excitable neurons.

Supplementing with riboflavin in higher doses, around 400 milligrams, has shown promising results for many individuals. Additionally, incorporating sea salt can be beneficial, as proper electrolyte balance is important.

Moreover, due to the oxidative stress associated with migraines, taking antioxidant-rich herbs such as ginger or turmeric may help mitigate free radical damage and provide further relief.
