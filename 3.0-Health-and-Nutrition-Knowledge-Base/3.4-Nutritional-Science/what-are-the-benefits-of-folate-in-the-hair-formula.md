# What are the benefits of Folate in the Hair Formula?

**Folate (as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-calcium)** 

Folate, particularly in the form of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) calcium, plays a vital role in hair health due to its involvement in cell growth and repair: 

- **Hair Growth:** Folate is essential for DNA and RNA synthesis, processes crucial for cell division and growth, including the cells within hair follicles. 

- **Hair Texture and Strength:** Folate contributes to the production of red blood cells, which transport oxygen and nutrients throughout the body, including the scalp and hair follicles.
