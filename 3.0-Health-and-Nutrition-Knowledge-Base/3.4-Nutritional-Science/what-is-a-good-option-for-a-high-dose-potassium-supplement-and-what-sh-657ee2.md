# What is a good option for a high-dose potassium supplement, and what should be considered when choosing one for effectiveness and safety?

Of course, I'm not biased of my own electrolyte powder, but I think it's pretty high quality. You should try that one.

But it's high potassium, it was a thousand milligrams. You know, you try to buy a potassium supplement, it only comes in 99 milligrams. I mean, why is that per dose? Is it like you'd have to have the whole bottle.

Our bodies need 4,700 per day and that's, it could be more than that, especially if you're adding more salt to your diet. So I think it's an interesting experiment on your body to just see what you would feel like if you actually got 4,700 milligrams of potassium, because potassium is necessary for the sodium-potassium pump that pumps all the nerves in your muscles and your body. So without that, you're gonna be tired.

And this is probably why when people do the electrolyte powders with the potassium, they can go along with exercise as well, because they have more energy.
