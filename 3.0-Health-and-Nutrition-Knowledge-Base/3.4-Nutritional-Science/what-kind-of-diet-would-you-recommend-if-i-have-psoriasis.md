# What kind of diet would you recommend if I have psoriasis?

For managing psoriasis, focus on:

1\. **L-Glutamine**: Strengthens the gut lining and supports gut health. Start with 1 gram daily, gradually increasing to 10 grams split into three doses on an empty stomach.

2\. **Tamanu oil**: Apply topically for its antibacterial and skin-healing properties.

3\. **Vitamin D3 and K2**: Take 10,000 IU of D3 and 100 mcg of K2 (MK7) daily to support immune function and skin health.

Avoid inflammatory vegetable oils and consider adopting a healthy keto diet with intermittent fasting to reduce inflammation and support your immune system. Periodic prolonged fasting may also help alleviate symptoms over time.
