# What lifestyle changes can promote longevity, improve health, and reduce age-related diseases?

If we look at risk factors for heart disease, high LDL increases your risk by 38 percent. But insulin resistance increases your risk by 540 percent.

Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, like diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension, can be caused by insulin resistance. This seems to mean that insulin resistance is the biggest risk factor for premature cardiac death.

The most popular mainstream treatment for high cholesterol is statin drugs. Studies have shown that statins can potentially lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. Healthy mitochondria are essential to longevity. Statins may also impair the mitochondria and increase apoptosis (death of the mitochondria).

An interesting study links higher LDL cholesterol to inversely affecting mortality. This means that having higher LDL may help extend your lifespan. Cholesterol is involved in a myriad of functions in the body—it’s essential for a healthy life.

Blood thinners and even the heart-healthy diet recommended by the American Heart Association can also contribute to insulin resistance and high blood sugar. To live longer, improving insulin resistance, making insulin more sensitive, and stabilizing your blood sugar is crucial.

**The most important things you can do to support healthy insulin and blood sugar include:**

1\. Getting on a low-carb diet (the ketogenic diet)

2\. Doing intermittent fasting

3\. Not restricting cholesterol

4\. Consuming vegetables

5\. Exercising
