Addressing ADD and ADHD with Niacinamide

Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) present challenges such as hyperactivity and lack of focus. These symptoms can be significantly alleviated with a natural remedyâ€”niacinamide, a form of vitamin B3.

Administering approximately 250 milligrams of niacinamide six to eight times a day ensures a consistent level in the bloodstream, given its water-soluble nature. A deficiency in niacinamide can lead to accelerated mental activity, resulting in difficulty focusing and hyperactivity. Supplementing with niacinamide helps to calm the nervous system at a cellular level, improving focus, task completion, and sleep quality. This approach offers a promising natural alternative for managing the symptoms of ADD and ADHD.
