# Healthiest Keto Cookies

The recipe for the healthiest cookies in the world:

**Ingredients**:

8 ounces (2 sticks) of butter (Organic -- or my favorite; Kerrygold Irish Butter)

4 Tbs. of xylitol (sweetener) (get on amazon.com or at the health food store)

2 cups of almond flour

2 cups of crushed pecans

1 chocolate bar (3.5 ounces) -- must be diabetic chocolate (I like Simply LiteÂ® -- from Trader Joes)

1 pinch of sea salt

2 tsp. of vanilla extract

**Where to get:**

**Kerrygold butter:** most grocery stores, but Trader Joes, BJs, and health food stores have it. But any European butter or organic butter will work.

**Almond Flour:** most health food stores or on amazon.com

**Pecans:** you can find them at any grocery store, but on amazon.com they are less expensive.

**Xylitol:** you can find it at the health food store or amazon.com

**Simply Lite Chocolate:** Trader Joes or online.

**Directions:**

- Preheat oven at 325. Leave butter out of the refrigerator overnight -- must be soft. Mix the butter (8 ounces) with the xylitol (4 Tbs) with a mixer (or by hand) until very smooth. For time sake, mix with fork until a smooth consistency.

- Crush the pecans (in grinder, food processor or in a bag with a rolling pin). Make sure it's 2 cups after crushing.

- Breakdown (or grind) the chocolate bar (3.5 ounces) in a food processor or other means.

- Mix thoroughly the now sweetened butter, almond flour (2 cups), crushed pecans (2 cups), crushed chocolate bar, pinch of sea salt, 2 Tsp of vanilla extract in a bowl. You could, as an option, have your food processor mix it instead.

- Form little balls with your hands and roll them in some almond flour (to coat them), putting them on a cookie sheet with parchment paper.

- Cook for 13 minutes at 325 degrees, then let them sit out of the oven for 10 minutes.

- Transfer to the freezer until frozen. Then store them in the refrigerator.

Enjoy!!!!!!!!

**Mistakes:** 

1\. Let them completely cool down or they will crumble and disintegrate when you try to pick one up. I also put them in the freezer, make them solid and we're good to go. Consuming them cold and slightly frozen is much tastier than consuming them warm.

2\. I also found that using the "no sugar added" diabetic chocolate works better with milk chocolate, not dark chocolate.  

3\. Almond flour works better than almond meal.

4\. I also found that if you substitute crushed pecans with crushed macadamia nuts or crushed cashews (same amounts), it will add a different flavor, be very rich, and also crazy delicious. If you do this, make sure you do not add that pinch of salt, because macadamia nuts and cashews may already come with salt.

5\. Using vanilla extract.

6\. Leave the butter out of the refrigerator overnight.
