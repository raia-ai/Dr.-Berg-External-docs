# What is angular cheilitis, and what are the various factors and underlying conditions that can lead to its development?

Angular cheilitis is a condition where the corners of your mouth become dry, cracked, and inflamed. This condition can last for only a few days, or it can last years. It has a simple cause that can be easily fixed with diet.

**Cause #1: Lack of vitamin B2**

Cracked corners in your mouth are caused by low levels of vitamin B2. Consuming too many refined grains and some other products will deplete your body of this vitamin.
