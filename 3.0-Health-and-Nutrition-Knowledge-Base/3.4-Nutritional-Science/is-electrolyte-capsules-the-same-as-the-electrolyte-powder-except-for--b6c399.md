# Is Electrolyte Capsules the same as the Electrolyte Powder except for the stevia and the flavoring?

Both our Electrolyte Powder and Electrolyte Capsules contain 5 crucial electrolytes and a powerful trace mineral complex designed to help support energy, endurance, and hydration. Our capsules do not contain stevia or flavoring and are meant to swallow whole, while our powders are designed to mix into water to enjoy as a beverage. You can check them out using the links below:
