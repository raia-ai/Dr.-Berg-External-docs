# Should I add fats to my salad?

Your body requires fat to absorb essential nutrients because many phytochemicals, such as carotenoids, are fat-soluble. Without sufficient fat, these nutrients may pass through your digestive system without being properly absorbed.

Studies indicate that including fat in your salad can enhance the absorption of carotenoids like beta-carotene and lycopene by up to 15 times compared to fat-free salads.
