# What will happen if you take Omega-3 fish oil for a month?

Both cod liver oil and fish oil contain omega-3 fatty acids, with the addition of vitamin A and vitamin D in cod liver oil. Around 25% of the fat in your brain is the omega-3 fatty acid, DHA. Most of this fat is in the frontal cortex, which supports memory, focus, concentration, and attention. DHA supports the integrity of the membranes around the neurons and supports the retina. It also protects against inflammation, UV radiation, and macular degeneration.

Omega-3 fatty acids keep skin smooth and protect against acne, psoriasis, eczema, dry skin, red skin, and ultraviolet light. They can also help remineralize bone, decrease the risk of osteoporosis, and improve arthritis and joint inflammation.

Taking cod liver oil or fish oil for 30 days has even more potential benefits, including the following:

•Supports liver health

•Helps regulate blood sugar

•Helps reverse insulin resistance

•Supports inside of the arteries

•Reduces symptoms of asthma and allergies

•Supports fertility

•Helps eliminate soreness and inflammation after exercise

Avoid choosing fish oil based on price alone. Some fish oils are poor quality and may be rancid or oxidized. Know the source of your fish oil to avoid getting a product contaminated with heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, or mercury. Fish oil and cod liver oil may taste like fish, but they shouldn’t have a rancid taste. To minimize the taste, try looking for supplements in pearl form. Omega-3 foods include fatty fish such as wild-caught salmon, herring, mackerel, and sardines. Shellfish and grass-fed dairy products also contain omega-3 fatty acids.
