# What supplements do I miss if I have arthritis?

Boron is a valuable trace mineral that supports joint health by aiding mineral utilization, reducing inflammation, and promoting bone strength. It may also benefit dental health, hormone balance, and prostate health. Consider a supplement starting at 3mg, three times daily for potential arthritis relief, but consult your doctor first, especially if you have health concerns.
