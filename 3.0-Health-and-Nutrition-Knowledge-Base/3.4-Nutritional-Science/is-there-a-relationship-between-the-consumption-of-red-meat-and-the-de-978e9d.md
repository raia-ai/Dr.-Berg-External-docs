# Is there a relationship between the consumption of red meat and the development of fatty liver disease?

There's typically no direct connection between consuming high-quality, grass-fed red meat and developing a fatty liver. In fact, red meat contains nutrients like choline that can support liver health. Fatty liver conditions are often more closely linked to excessive carbohydrate intake and other dietary factors. It's important to consider your overall diet and lifestyle when addressing fatty liver concerns.
