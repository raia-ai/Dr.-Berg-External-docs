# What are the most effective strategies for managing and reducing alcohol cravings?

Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body. Glutamine turns into glutamate, which is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain.  L-glutamine increases gluconeogenesis, which is the production of new sugar. This means that this amino acid can quickly turn to sugar and feed your brain cells, but it won’t spike your insulin. 

Both sugar and alcohol can provide a sense of relief to some people. L-glutamine may help provide fuel to the brain and reduce stress, anxiety, and pressure—this may help reduce the need for alcohol and sugar. L-glutamine has many other potential health benefits, as well.  Alcohol consumption can block glutamine and all of the beneficial effects that come with it.
