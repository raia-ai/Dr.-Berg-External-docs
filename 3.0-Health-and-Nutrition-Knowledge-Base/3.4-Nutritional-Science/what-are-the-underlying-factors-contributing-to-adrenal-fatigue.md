# What are the underlying factors contributing to adrenal fatigue?

**Cause #1: Chronic stress**

Chronic stress can cause your adrenal glands to work without rest at producing stress hormones (like cortisol). Over time, chronic stress causes adrenal glands to burn out and not function properly. Therefore, your body canâ€™t handle stress effectively anymore because your cells become resistant to stress hormones being overproduced.

**Cause #2: Low vitamin B1**

Vitamin B1 (thiamin) is vital for normal functioning of the nervous system and for regulating stress levels in the body. Low vitamin B1 can reduce your ability to handle physical and mental stress. If you are deficient in B1 your adrenal glands can eventually wear out, resulting in the adrenal fatigue symptoms mentioned above.

**Remedies:**

- Take vitamin B1

- nutritional yeast

- benfotiamine

- Avoid alcohol

- Avoid drinking too much coffee or tea

- Avoid diuretics and antibiotics
