# I experience headaches on keto. What do I do?

This is usually a problem with low blood sugar. Your brain has not fully adapted to ketosis quite yet. Add one more meal for a while until your body adapts more efficiently and can go longer without the drop in blood sugars. We also recommend taking Dr. Berg's course on How to Burn Fat & Get into Healthy Ketosis WITHOUT Any Side Effects! Here is the link to the course: [https://www.drberg.com/how-to-do-ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/how-to-do-ketosis)
