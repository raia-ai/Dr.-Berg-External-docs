# What are the common causes of low blood pressure?

Low blood pressure can cause a lot of problems if the causes are unknown and only symptoms are treated. Let’s take a look at common reasons behind it.

**Cause #1: Postural hypotension (POTS)**

Postural hypotension (or POTS) is a condition where, if you stand up too fast, you feel dizzy. This condition is linked to the low blood sugar that can result when your stress-regulating glands (adrenals) are worn out or you are deficient in vitamin B1. When weak adrenals or deficiency in B1 bring about low blood sugar, it can show up as POTS.

**Remedies:**

- Take vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

- Avoid refined carbs and sugar (they deplete you of vitamin B1)

- Avoid alcohol (depletes you of vitamin B1)

- Support your adrenals by doing the following:

    - improve sleep (take naps if needed)

    - regularly exercise (don’t overtrain)

    - take long walks outside (at least 45 minutes)

    - take magnesium

- take potassium

- You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support

- You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Cause #2: Dehydration**

If you don’t consume enough fluid in your diet this can result in dehydration of your body and, as a result, low blood pressure. Dehydration can be caused by vomiting, diarrhea, diuretics, not drinking enough fluid or lack of electrolytes (especially salt and potassium). Salt is very important for your body to be able to retain fluid, so make sure you are not deficient in it.

**Remedies:**

- Drink more fluids

- Take electrolytes high in potassium

- Consume more Himalayan sea salt

- Consume more vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)

- Avoid diuretics

**Other causes:**

- Medication (diuretics, antidepressants, HBP meds)

- Addison’s disease

- Iron deficiency (anemia)

- B12 and folate deficiency

- After eating your blood pressure can go low
