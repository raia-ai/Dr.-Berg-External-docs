# How can I introduce salad back in my diet after I had a pause in consuming salads?

If you experience fatigue after eating salads, donâ€™t give up on them just yet. Salads are a nutrient-dense addition to a balanced diet, and with a few adjustments, you can enjoy their benefits without discomfort.

**Tips for Increasing Salad Intake:**

\- **Start small:** Gradually incorporate smaller portions of salad into your meals to allow your digestive system to adjust to the increased fiber.

\- **Increase gradually:** As your body adapts, slowly increase portion sizes to build tolerance over time.

\- **Diversify ingredients:** Vary the vegetables and toppings to ensure a wide range of nutrients and avoid overloading on a single type of fiber.

\- **Pair with protein:** Include a source of lean protein, like grilled chicken, tofu, or legumes, to balance the fiber and promote sustained energy.

By easing into a higher intake of salads and being mindful of your choices, you can enjoy their health benefits without experiencing post-meal tiredness.
