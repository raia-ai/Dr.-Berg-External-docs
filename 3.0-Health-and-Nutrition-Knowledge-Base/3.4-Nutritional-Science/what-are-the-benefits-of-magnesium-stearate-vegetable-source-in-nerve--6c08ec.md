# What are the benefits of magnesium stearate (vegetable source) in Nerve Support with Benfotiamine?

**Why Magnesium Stearate (vegetable source)** **is added to our Nerve Support with Benfotiamine.**

Magnesium stearate, derived from vegetable sources, serves several important functions in supplements: 

- **Lubricant and Flow Agent:** Magnesium stearate acts as a lubricant, preventing ingredients from sticking to manufacturing equipment during production. This ensures smooth and efficient production of tablets and capsules.   

- **Safe and Well-Tolerated:** When used in small amounts, magnesium stearate is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA. It is poorly absorbed by the body and mostly passes through the digestive system unchanged.
