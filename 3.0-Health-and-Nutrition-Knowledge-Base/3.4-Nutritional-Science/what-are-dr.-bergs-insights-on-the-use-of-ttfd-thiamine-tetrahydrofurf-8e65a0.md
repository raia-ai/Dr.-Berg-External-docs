# What are Dr. Berg's insights on the use of TTFD (Thiamine Tetrahydrofurfuryl Disulfide) as a supplement, particularly regarding its potential health benefits and applications?

Dr. Berg's thoughts on TTFD (thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide) highlight that it is a synthetic form of vitamin B1. While he prefers natural sources, such as allithiamine from garlic, he acknowledges that TTFD has proven to be effective.

Key points to consider:

1\. **Natural vs. Synthetic**: Allithiamine, derived from garlic, is a natural form of B1 that Dr. Berg favors. However, TTFD is also effective and can be a good source of B1.

2\. **Solubility**: The choice between fat-soluble and water-soluble forms of B1 depends on the intended use. For brain-related benefits, a fat-soluble form might be preferable, whereas benfotiamine, another B1 variant, effectively penetrates peripheral nerves but not the central nervous system.

3\. **Further Information**: For a more detailed discussion, Dr. Berg has a comprehensive video on this topic.

In summary, both natural and synthetic forms of B1 have their benefits, and the choice depends on the specific health goals.
