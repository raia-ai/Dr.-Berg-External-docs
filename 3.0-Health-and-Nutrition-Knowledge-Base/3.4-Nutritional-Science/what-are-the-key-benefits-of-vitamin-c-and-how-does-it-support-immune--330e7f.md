# What are the key benefits of vitamin C, and how does it support immune function and antioxidant activity?

Heart attacks are the number one cause of death worldwide, so it makes sense to discover the cardiovascular health benefits of vitamin C. There’s a condition called atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. Sometimes people believe it’s caused by consuming too much cholesterol, but it’s not. Your body makes its own cholesterol in large amounts. It may show up to heal damage to a blood vessel, but it’s not the cause.

The cause of damage to an artery is structure weakness in the blood vessel itself. The innermost lining of the artery has what are called endothelial cells composed of collagen, and they need vitamin C to stay strong. Vitamin C is a cofactor for collagen production and vascular smooth muscle. You have muscles around your arteries that help them contract and relax, so it’s critical to maintain their elasticity. Yet, for example, insulin can cause your arteries to thicken and harden.

High insulin, which causes insulin resistance, is one of the key factors that causes vitamin C deficiency. There are nearly 500 clinical trials showing that vitamin C supplementation leads to an improvement in endothelial function. If the arterial wall gets damaged, your body sends cholesterol, calcium, and protein to repair the damage by forming a clot. Vitamin C also helps keep the clot from breaking off and causing a stroke or heart attack.

Classic signs of vitamin C deficiency are scurvy and fragile blood vessels. How do you become deficient? Well, by developing insulin resistance, and poor eating habits; specifically not eating enough vegetables, smoking, taking medications, and drinking alcohol.

I urge you to consume foods high in vitamin C, including bell peppers, cabbage, sauerkraut, and leafy greens. Nearly all vegetables have vitamin C.

Now you know the cardiovascular health benefits of vitamin C!
