Trace minerals are minerals that are needed in very small amounts. Trace minerals function to help make enzymes work. Enzymes work to build up proteins and break down proteins. Youâ€™re probably eating enough protein, but you need the activation of that protein to make it available through the liver and to the skin and hair. 

Trace minerals are missing in our environment, but they are essential for healthy hair, nails, and skin.
