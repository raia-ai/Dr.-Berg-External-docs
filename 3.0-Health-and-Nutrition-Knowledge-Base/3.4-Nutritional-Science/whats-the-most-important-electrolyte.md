Your heart, your fluid, your energy, and your nutrients in and out of the cell is dependent on the sodium and potassium pump. However, potassium is the most difficult to get from the diet. High levels of cortisol (stress), insulin, sugar, diuretics, excessive salt, and surgery, all can deplete potassium. However, you need between 7-10 cups of salad or veggies to get your daily requirement of 4700mg.
