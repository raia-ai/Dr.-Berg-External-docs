# Can phytic acid cause zinc deficiency, and how does it inhibit zinc absorption?

Foods high in phytic acid can have a negative effect on zinc absorption and can even lead to zinc deficiency. A diet high in whole grains, sugars, and carbohydrates can deplete zinc due to the high levels of phytic acid in these foods.

In addition to foods high in phytic acid, gastric bypass, digestive issues, absorption issues, GMO foods, diabetes, and liver issues can all contribute to zinc deficiency.
