# What nutrient deficiency cause migraines?

**Migraines, Mitochondria, and the Power of Vitamin B2**

Migraines can be a debilitating experience – intense pain, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea... it's no wonder they're linked to the #1 vitamin deficiency. While genetics can play a role, don't despair. Understanding the factors that trigger your migraines can help you manage them effectively.

The key may lie in your mitochondria, the powerhouses of your cells. Research suggests a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and migraines. This is where riboflavin (vitamin B2) comes in! It supports healthy mitochondrial function and the production of glutathione, a crucial antioxidant that protects your brain cells.

**Why B2 Matters**

B2 deficiency is a common factor in migraines. It plays a crucial role in oxygen utilization within your mitochondria – vital for energy production. If you have a genetic tendency towards mitochondrial issues, you might need even more B2.

**B2 for Migraine Relief**

- **Prevention:** Try 400mg of vitamin B2 daily.

- **Acute Attack:** If a migraine strikes, try 100mg of B2 every hour until symptoms subside (up to a maximum of 400mg daily).

**Beyond B2**

Sodium deficiency can also trigger migraines, so consider increasing your sea salt intake. If B2 alone doesn't provide full relief, natural remedies like ginger or turmeric may offer additional support.

**Important:** Always consult your doctor before starting any new supplements or making significant dietary changes, especially if you experience migraines.
