# What steps can I take to eliminate liver cysts?

The body’s formation of granuloma annulare is often a protective response to wall off an infection, microbe, or toxin. To address this, I recommend exploring my videos, particularly those related to biofilms. Additionally, consider following the protocols for the liver body type, which I’ve also discussed in my videos. Adhering to these guidelines for a period may lead to a reduction in cysts, although it’s important to note that they are typically benign and may not always resolve completely.

TUDCA has shown promising research regarding its potential to decrease cyst formation, but it should be viewed as a supplementary remedy. Prioritize implementing dietary changes, as a proper diet is the most critical first step in this process.
