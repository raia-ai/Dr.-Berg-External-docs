**Glycine: The Unsung Hero of Your Health**

Collagen, the protein that keeps your skin, joints, and connective tissues strong, is made up of about 30% glycine. While your body produces some glycine, it may not be enough â€“ especially if you don't regularly eat skin and cartilage from meat.

**Why You Need Glycine**

- **Fights Inflammation:** Glycine is both a powerful anti-inflammatory and helps your body produce glutathione, its master antioxidant.

- **Supports Detoxification:** Without sufficient glycine, your body's ability to remove toxins is reduced.

- **Benefits Beyond Beauty:** Glycine is essential for healthy gums, DNA, sleep, liver function, blood sugar balance, and even weight loss.

- **Glucose Without the Spikes:** Your body can use glycine to make glucose when needed, but it also helps balance blood sugar by stimulating glucagon.

**Are You Getting Enough?**

If you don't eat a nose-to-tail diet, experience stress, take medications, drink alcohol, or are exposed to toxins, you might be deficient in glycine.

**How to Boost Your Glycine Levels**

- **Homemade Gelatin:** A delicious and easy way to increase your glycine intake.

- **Glycine Supplements:** Aim for 4 to 10 grams per day.

- **Bone Broth & Pork Rinds:** Offer some glycine, but you'll need to eat plenty to get a significant amount.

As we age, our glycine needs increase. Boosting your levels could help with conditions like osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, insomnia, and more.
