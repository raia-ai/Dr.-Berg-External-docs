# What are the primary causes of osteoporosis, and how do factors such as age, hormonal changes, and lifestyle choices contribute to its development?

Osteoporosis means a severe loss of bone mass and density. Osteopenia is a lesser version of it. What is important to know is that consuming calcium (which is used as a general remedy) is not going to remedy it. Bone is made from protein, minerals and calcium--not just from calcium.

**Cause #1: Stress**

When you are undergoing stress, your adrenal glands produce cortisol (stress hormone). Cortisol in itself does damage your bones. When you are undergoing chronic stress, and your body is not recovering well from it, this can cause osteoporosis.

**Cause #2: Vitamin D and K2 deficiency**

VItamin D is a vital hormone for healthy functioning of your bones, immune system, mood etc. It increases the absorption of calcium by 20x. Additionally, vitamin K2 allocates free calcium units in the blood to needed tissues. Vitamin D and K2 work together. If you are deficient in them, this can cause osteoporosis.
