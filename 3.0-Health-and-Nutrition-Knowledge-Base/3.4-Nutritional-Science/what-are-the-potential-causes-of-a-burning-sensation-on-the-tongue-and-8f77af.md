# What are the potential causes of a burning sensation on the tongue, and how do these factors affect oral health and comfort?

**It’s a vitamin B12 deficiency. Of course, the question is, how do you become B12 deficient? There are several primary causes, including:**

1\. Low stomach acid

2\. Gastric bypass surgery

3\. A problem in your intestines such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or Crohn’s disease

4\. Being a vegan, because B12 mostly comes from eggs, meats and organs, and dairy. If you’re vegan, add B12 in the natural form called methylcobalamin

5\. Alcohol, which is why alcoholics are often B12 deficient. In fact, anyone with liver damage will have difficulty absorbing B12

Now you can find out what’s causing your burning tongue!
