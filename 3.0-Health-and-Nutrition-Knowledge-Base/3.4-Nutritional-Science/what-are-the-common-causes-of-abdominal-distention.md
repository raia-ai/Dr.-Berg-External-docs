# What are the common causes of abdominal distention?

Abdominal distention, characterized by swelling and discomfort after meals, can stem from various causes:

1\. **Microbial Fermentation:**

\- Overload of carbohydrates and excessive fiber can lead to microbial fermentation in the gut, causing gas and distention.

\- Remedies include reducing carb and fiber intake, using apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride before meals, and consuming ginger, fennel seeds (avoid during pregnancy), anise, peppermint, and cooked vegetables. Probiotics can also help.

2\. **Food Sensitivities and Intolerances:**

\- Intolerance to FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols), lectins, or specific allergens can cause inflammation and digestive issues.

\- Remedies involve avoiding high-FODMAP foods like certain fruits, dairy products, wheat, and legumes, and substituting with low-FODMAP alternatives. Avoiding high-lectin foods and allergens while maintaining a food diary can help identify triggers.

3\. **Gluten and Grains Consumption:**

\- Gluten and grains are common culprits for bloating. Avoiding these foods can alleviate symptoms.

\- Remedies include eliminating gluten-containing foods such as bread, pasta, and cereals, as well as other grain products, sugars, and alcoholic beverages.

Other Considerations:

\- Addressing factors like lack of bile, liver health, excessive fiber intake, large meal consumption, SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth), frequent eating, intolerance to lectins, fat intolerance, adrenal fatigue, and protein overload may also help manage abdominal distention.

Natural Remedies:

\- Acupressure techniques can potentially aid in alleviating symptoms of abdominal distention.

Consulting a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment plan is recommended for persistent abdominal discomfort.
