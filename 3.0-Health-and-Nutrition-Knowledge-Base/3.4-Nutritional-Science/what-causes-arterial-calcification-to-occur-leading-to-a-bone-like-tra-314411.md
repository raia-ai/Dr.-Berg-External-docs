# What causes arterial calcification to occur, leading to a bone-like transformation, and what are the associated health implications?

The body becomes more calcified with age. But, our goal is to keep the bones calcified and the other tissues from becoming calcified. A CAC test is a great way to determine if you have calcium in your arteries.

There are two types of cells in your bones. Osteoblasts are cells that build bone, and osteoclasts break down bones. If there are too many osteoblasts in your arteries, the arteries can start turning to bone. There are stem cells in the inner tissue of the arteries that have the potential to turn into a certain type of cell, depending on what the body needs.

If someone is developing bone tissue in their arteries, there is a problem with the differentiation of these stem cells—they’re turning into the wrong thing. Sufficient amounts of vitamin K2 may help inhibit calcification. Vitamin K2 helps keep calcium out of the arteries and in the bones, making the bones strong. Your good bacteria make vitamin K2.
