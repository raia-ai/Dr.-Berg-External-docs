# What causes adrenal fatigue outside of stress?

The adrenals consist of an outer glandular layer that produces cortisol and other hormones, and an inner layer that makes neurotransmitters. The inner part is involved in the fight or flight response (sympathetic nervous system), countered by the parasympathetic nervous system. If the parasympathetic system is weak, you may feel constantly stressed. Low vitamin B1 (thiamine) affects the brain stem and can impair stress adaptation, causing dizziness when standing up quickly. Symptoms of adrenal fatigue and B1 deficiency include:

• Low ability to adapt to stress

• Anxiety

• Fatigue

Common causes of vitamin B1 deficiency are:

• Refined carbs and sugar

• Alcohol

• Coffee

• Tea

• Sulfites

• Antibiotics

• Diuretics
