# What is Benfotiamine?

**Benfotiamine:** 

1. **Fat-Soluble**: Benfotiamine is a fat-soluble form of Vitamin B1, which allows it to be absorbed more efficiently and penetrate cells and tissues more effectively than water-soluble Thiamine. 

2. **Nerve Health Support:** This nutrient supports nerve health and helps maintain the normal structure and function of the myelin sheath (the insulation around nerve axons). It also supports the body's natural processes for managing advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and maintaining a healthy inflammatory response. This contributes to: 

1. Supporting overall nerve function and comfort. 

2. Promoting a healthy nervous system environment 

3. **Supports Thiamine-Dependent Pathways:** As a lipid-soluble form of Vitamin B1, Benfotiamine helps maintain healthy thiamine levels. Thiamine is crucial for normal carbohydrate metabolism and plays an important role in supporting healthy nerve tissue and cardiovascular function.
