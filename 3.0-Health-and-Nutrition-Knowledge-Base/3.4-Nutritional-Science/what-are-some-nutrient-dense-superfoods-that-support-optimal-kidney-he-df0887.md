# What are some nutrient-dense superfoods that support optimal kidney health, and how do their specific properties contribute to protecting and enhancing renal function?

The kidneys are composed of complex filters known as nephrons. A proper diet is crucial to support these nephrons. If your nephrons are damaged, you may end up with a build-up of phosphorus, potassium, and sodium. It is essential to avoid junk food and minimize eating out.

One of the leading causes of kidney damage is diabetes, which comes from high blood sugar. Avoid sugar and compounds that act like sugar in the body, like refined starches. Drugs, alcohol, certain medications, smoking, and ultra-processed foods all destroy the kidneys. Seed oils like corn oil, soy oil, cottonseed oil, and canola oil contribute to inflammation and damage to the kidneys as well.

**Here are eight superfoods to include in your diet if you’re dealing with kidney damage:**

1\. Low phosphorus protein (sardines, salmon, cod, and sea bass)

2\. Spirulina

3\. Fermented foods (sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles)

4\. Avocado

5\. Extra virgin olive oil

6\. Cottage cheese or goat cheese

7\. Vitamin D

8\. Baja Gold sea salt

If you have kidney damage, you’ll want to avoid foods that are high in oxalates, lectins, and tannins. Avoid things like nuts, spinach, meats high in phosphorus, eggplant, potatoes, beans, and grains. Cat scans to examine damage to the kidney can also be very damaging. Opt for an ultrasound or MRI to assess kidney damage if possible.

**If you have kidney disease or kidney problems, you can still consume vegetables. The following vegetables are safe options for people with kidney issues:**

•Asparagus

•Celery

•Avocado

•Cucumber

•Garlic

•Cabbage

•Cauliflower

•Mushrooms

•Lettuce
