# How to do teeth whitening at home?

You don’t need to go to the dentist or purchase whitening strips for white teeth. Baking soda is nonabrasive and can be used to gently scrub your teeth to remove stains and plaque. You can combine baking soda with 3% hydrogen peroxide to whiten teeth at home. Combine 1 teaspoon of baking soda with 3 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide and 8 drops of water. This mixture breaks the bonds of tooth stains, leaving you with whiter teeth. It’s also beneficial for eliminating bacteria and reducing plaque formation.

Use a toothbrush to gently polish your teeth with this paste for 1 to 2 minutes. Rinse your mouth thoroughly when you’re finished. Do this 2 to 3 times per week for a few weeks for whiter teeth. Teeth whitening should be done gradually to avoid damaging the gums and tooth enamel. Oil pulling is an ancient practice that involves swishing oil in the mouth for 10 to 20 minutes. Coconut oil is great for oil pulling. It’s high in lauric acid, a potent anti-microbial that is effective against bacteria, fungus, and candida. It also helps with bad breath. Research has found oil pulling to be as effective as prescription mouthwash against gingivitis. Vitamin C and glucose compete in the body. Bleeding gums are often caused by low vitamin C. If you consume a lot of sugar, glucose will block your vitamin C, which will show up in your gums.
