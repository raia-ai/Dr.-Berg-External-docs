# How can I prevent muscle loss? Iâ€™m a senior.

Sarcopenia, or age-related muscle loss, can worsen due to immobility, nutritional deficiencies, lack of exercise, and certain diseases. To combat it, focus on routine exercise, especially resistance training, and consider supplements like vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, amino acids (especially leucine), and HMB (B-hydroxy B-methylbutyrate).
