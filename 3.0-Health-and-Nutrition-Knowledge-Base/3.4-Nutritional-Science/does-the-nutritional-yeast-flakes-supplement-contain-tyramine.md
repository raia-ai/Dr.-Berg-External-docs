# Does the Nutritional Yeast Flakes supplement contain tyramine?

From the Manufacturer: Nutritional yeast naturally contains the amino acid tyrosine, which can convert into tyramine. However, the level of conversion in our yeast is unknown and likely very low.

Tyramine levels generally increase with longer fermentation processes. Since our nutritional yeast flakes are primarily grown under controlled conditions, the risk of significant tyramine formation is minimal. Additionally, our testing on similar Brewer's yeast products showed either undetectable or very low tyramine levels (< 3 mcg/g).
