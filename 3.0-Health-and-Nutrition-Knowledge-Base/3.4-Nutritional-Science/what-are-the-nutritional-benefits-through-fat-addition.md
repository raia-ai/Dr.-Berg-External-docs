# What are the nutritional benefits through fat addition?

Incorporating healthy fats into your salads enhances both their flavor and nutritional value. Fats, such as those from avocado, nuts, seeds, olives, and cheeses, not only make salads more satisfying but also significantly boost nutrient absorption.

Fats facilitate the extraction of fat-soluble phytonutrients by stimulating bile release, which emulsifies the fats and aids in digestion. This process allows micelles to transport these nutrients across the intestinal wall into the bloodstream, maximizing their absorption.

Thus, adding healthy fats to your salad ensures that you're fully benefiting from its nutritional content.
