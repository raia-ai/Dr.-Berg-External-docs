# What is Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI)?

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is characterized by the pancreas's inability to produce sufficient digestive enzymes. This deficiency leads to difficulties breaking down and absorbing nutrients from food, particularly fats. Symptoms associated with EPI can include diarrhea, weight loss, and steatorrhea (oily, foul-smelling stools). This condition can arise due to underlying issues such as chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, or other factors impairing pancreatic function.
