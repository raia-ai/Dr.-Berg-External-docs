# Can I take bile salts without a gallbladder?

**Taking Bile Salts Without a Gallbladder**

Yes, you can take bile salts without a gallbladder. They help compensate for the less concentrated bile your liver releases directly into the digestive tract.

**Why You Might Need Bile Salts**

1\. **Vitamin A Absorption**: Poor night vision may indicate a vitamin A deficiency due to insufficient bile.

2\. **Stool Characteristics**: Light-colored, floating stools suggest a lack of bile, while diarrhea can indicate too much bile.

Monitoring these signs can help you determine the right amount of bile salts to support digestion and nutrient absorption.
