# Why should you never take Vitamin A supplements?

Vitamin A toxicity is rare, but taking a synthetic vitamin A supplement may increase your risk. Synthetic vitamin A may also increase the risk of lung cancer. Accutane, a form of synthetic vitamin A, has serious potential side effects. I suggest getting your vitamin A from food sources or natural food-based supplements.

Foods high in vitamin A (retinol):

• Cod liver oil

• Egg yolks

• Grass-fed butter

• Grass-fed cheese

• Liver

Beta carotene is the precursor to the active form of vitamin A (retinol). Beta carotene is in foods like carrots and spinach. But, If you’re relying on beta carotene alone to get your vitamin A or if you have a liver or gallbladder issue, you could be deficient in vitamin A.
