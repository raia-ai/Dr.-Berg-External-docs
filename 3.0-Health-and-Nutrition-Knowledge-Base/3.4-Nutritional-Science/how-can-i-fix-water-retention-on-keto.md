# How can I fix water retention on keto?

Possible causes of water retention and their fixes:

- Low in vitamin B1 (thiamine) – vitamin B1 deficiencies will create fluid retention and edema in the ankles. Add nutritional yeast to your diet.

- Low potassium – not consuming enough vegetables can keep potassium low. But if you are consuming a lot of vegetables and still have fluid retention, it’s because you can’t digest all the fiber and that it is too much for the microorganisms that you have. Your potassium source must be from among the leafy greens and it is needed to push out the fluids.

- Fiber – a hidden source of fluid retention. It retains fluid and the body will demand fluid to bulk up the fiber, to make the stool form and go through the system.

- High salt consumption

- High-carb diet – or too many carbs, because carbohydrates retain fluid.
