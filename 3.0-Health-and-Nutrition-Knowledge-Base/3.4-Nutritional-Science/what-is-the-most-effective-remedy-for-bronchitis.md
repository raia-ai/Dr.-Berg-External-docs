# What is the most effective remedy for bronchitis?

**You can use salt.** Not necessarily taking salt, but breathing in salt. There’s a machine called a halogenerator, which provides something called halotherapy where you breathe salt air. The machine ionizes the salt and puts it out into the air. You can use it while you sleep.

**Halotherapy** can loosen up the mucus in your lungs, sinuses, and throat. Salt has the capacity to thin out the mucus. It’s antifungal, antibacterial, and it’s also anti-mold. I’ve put links below to some machines that I think are good. (I’m not affiliated with the companies that make them.)

**Another option is to use something called a neti pot to wash out your sinuses with salt water.** Check your house for mold or mildew, which could be why your lungs are constantly filled with mucus. If you change locations, you might be surprised at how your sinus or lung condition goes away.

**From a nutritional standpoint, oregano oil is really good to treat mucus.**
