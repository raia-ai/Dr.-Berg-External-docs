# How do I know if an avocado is ready to eat?

Ripe avocados have dark, almost black skin with a bumpy texture. They are firm but do yield somewhat if pressure is applied. 

A firm avocado with green, smooth skin is likely underripe and needs a few more days to ripen. If an avocado is black, dented, and squishy, itâ€™s overripe and likely will have an unpleasant texture and bitter taste.
