**What are the various types of edible coatings used, and are there any associated health risks?**

**Traditional Coatings:**

\- **Beeswax and Shellac:** Natural coatings used for fruits and candies. Generally safe but may cause allergies.

\- **Paraffin Wax:** A petroleum byproduct with environmental concerns.

**Modern Alternatives:**

\- **Organic Coatings:** Made from carnauba wax and wood resin, generally safer but can impact produceâ€™s natural microbiome.

**Health Concerns:**

\- **Long-Term Safety:** The safety of long-term consumption of coatings like Apeel, especially with other additives and toxins, is still uncertain. Fresh, uncoated produce is preferable.
