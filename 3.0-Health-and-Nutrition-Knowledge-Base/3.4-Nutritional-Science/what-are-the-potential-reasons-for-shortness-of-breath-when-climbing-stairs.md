# What are the potential reasons for shortness of breath when climbing stairs?

If you are out of breath when climbing stairs this could be due to several reasons. Although an underlying disease can cause shortness of breath after climbing stairs, diet and lifestyle choices can also be at the root of this problem.

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiencies**

Vitamins and minerals are essential for managing lung function, inflammation, muscle function, and heart activity. If you are deficient in vital nutrients, you can have a difficult time catching your breath. The main vitamin to pay attention to is B1. One of the main effects of a B1 deficiency is that you find you have breathing problems.

**Cause #2: pH imbalances**

A highly acidic body (acidosis) or a highly alkaline body (alkalosis) can cause you to feel out of breath or hungry for air. The solution is simple: normalize your pH level with the right diet.
