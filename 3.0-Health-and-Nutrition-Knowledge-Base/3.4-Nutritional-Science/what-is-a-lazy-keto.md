# What is a lazy keto?

Lazy keto is when you do not count calories or ketones. You primarily focus on counting carbohydratesâ€“and keeping them below 50 grams per day. Lazy keto also involves consuming a moderate amount of protein (roughly 3 to 8 oz per meal) and consuming high amounts of fat (without focusing on the quality of fat).
