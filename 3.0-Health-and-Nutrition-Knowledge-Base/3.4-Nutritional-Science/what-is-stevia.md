# What is stevia?

**Understanding Stevia: A Natural Sweetener**

Stevia, derived from the leaves of the *Stevia rebaudiana* plant, is a natural sweetener known for its remarkable sweetness—up to 300 times sweeter than sugar. Used for centuries in South America, it is now a popular sugar substitute in various forms, including liquid, packets, and granulated blends.

**Impact on Blood Sugar**

Stevia has minimal impact on blood sugar levels. Unlike regular sugar, which causes rapid glucose spikes, stevia’s compounds, steviol glycosides, are not metabolized by the body. Instead, they pass through the digestive system unabsorbed, making stevia a suitable option for individuals with diabetes and those on low-carb diets.
