# What lifestyle changes can prevent neuropathy progression, and how do they support nerve health and well-being?

Along with the natural remedies for diabetic peripheral neuropathy making some lifestyle changes can help prevent more nerve damage and boost your overall health.

### **Reducing Alcohol Intake**

Drinking too much alcohol can make nerve damage worse and mess with your blood sugar levels. If you have diabetic peripheral neuropathy, it's a good idea to cut back on alcohol or quit altogether. This way, you'll avoid the added risk of alcoholic neuropathy.

### **Managing Blood Pressure**

When high blood pressure damages the vessels feeding your nerves, it can lead to worsening neuropathy. Keep your levels healthy with these strategies:

- Eating a low-sodium diet

- Exercising regularly

- Managing stress

- Taking blood pressure medication as prescribed

Changing your lifestyle and using natural remedies can really help with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. These changes might ease symptoms, stop more nerve damage from happening, and make you feel better overall.

Sometimes, taking high doses of **benfotiamine and lipoic acid** is needed to fully relieve painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
