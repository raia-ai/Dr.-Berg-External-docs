# What is the best hair loss test?

You need to test your Vitamin D levels!

Vitamin D is not a vitamin; it’s a hormone intimately involved in 10% of our genes. If you don’t have enough vitamin D, it can interfere with the genes responsible for hair growth. There is also a very high concentration of vitamin D receptors in the hair follicle. Without enough vitamin D, your immune system is at risk of autoimmune conditions, including alopecia. Vitamin D supports the T cells that help combat autoimmune diseases. Psoriasis, dandruff, and dermatitis are also related to low vitamin D.

Magnesium is the most potent regulator of calcium and is involved with enzymes important for hair health. It’s also essential for the proper function of vitamin D. There are 2 systems of vitamin D: one that controls calcium and one that has several functions, including hair growth and hair restoration. This form of vitamin D has a 24-hour half-life, so you need daily sun or supplements to prevent a hair loss problem.

Your blood vitamin D levels should be at least 70 to 100 ng/mL. You need at least 20,000 IU of vitamin D daily and 50 mg of magnesium to support hair growth. Zinc, iron, vitamin B12, and omega-3 fatty acids are also essential for hair restoration.
