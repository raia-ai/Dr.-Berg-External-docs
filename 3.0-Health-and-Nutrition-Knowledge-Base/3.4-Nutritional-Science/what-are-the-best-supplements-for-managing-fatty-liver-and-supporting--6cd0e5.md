# What are the best supplements for managing fatty liver and supporting health without a gallbladder?

For addressing a fatty liver and the absence of a gallbladder, taking bile salts is essential. The gallbladderâ€™s primary role is to concentrate bile, not just store it. Without this concentration, bile is less effective, which can impact the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. Supplementing with bile salts can help mitigate this effect, ensuring proper nutrient extraction and supporting liver health in the long term.
