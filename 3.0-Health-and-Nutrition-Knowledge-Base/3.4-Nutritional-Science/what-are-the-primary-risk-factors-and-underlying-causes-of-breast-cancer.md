# What are the primary risk factors and underlying causes of breast cancer?

**Two Common Triggers of Breast Disease:**

• Excessive Amounts of Estrogen

Recommendation: High-Quality Source Sea Kelp and Cruciferous Vegetables Avoid Soy/GMO Products and Go Organic

• High Levels of Insulin – It can make the cells grow, divide and multiply

Recommendation: Do Ketogenic Diet and Intermittent Fasting Sugar and Refined Carbohydrates trigger insulin

**Mammograms**

• Mammograms can be traumatic because you are putting the breast on the plate and you are creating compression.

• Inflammatory Oncotaxis – a term that describes a condition where cells travel in the areas of inflammation in trauma. They use Ionizing Radiation, these little wave particles that go through and disrupt the electrons and certain molecules in your cells.
