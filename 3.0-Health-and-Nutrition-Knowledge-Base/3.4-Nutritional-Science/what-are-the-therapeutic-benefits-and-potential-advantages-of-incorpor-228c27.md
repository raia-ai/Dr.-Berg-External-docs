# What are the therapeutic benefits and potential advantages of incorporating Rhodiola into a health regimen?

Rhodiola is an adaptogen, which is a type of herb that helps you adapt to stress. It’s been suggested that rhodiola has a really interesting effect of significantly reducing perceived effort after exercise.

Rhodiola has a lot of potential benefits and may help with certain issues, including:

• Stress

• Coughing

• Fatigue

• Depression

• Altitude sickness

• Tissue and organ damage from hypoxia

Rhodiola may even help support cognitive function as well as improve HRV and angina pain. In one study, people who took rhodiola had more energy after exercise than those who had a placebo. Sleep is a huge factor when it comes to recovery from stress and exercise. It just so happens that rhodiola may help support healthy sleep cycles. One study even suggested that your body may need less sleep to get rejuvenated when taking rhodiola.

Rhodiola may also help increase glycogen reserves (stored fuel) and ATP (energy).
