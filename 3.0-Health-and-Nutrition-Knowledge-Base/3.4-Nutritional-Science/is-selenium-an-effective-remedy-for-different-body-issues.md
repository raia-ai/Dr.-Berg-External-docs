# Is selenium an effective remedy for different body issues?

Selenium serves as a crucial coenzyme involved in approximately 25 different proteins and acts as a potent antioxidant alongside glutathione, protecting tissues from damage caused by heavy metals, chemicals, or sugars, which can be detrimental to the brain and nervous system, especially in conditions like diabetes. It plays a role in improving insulin resistance and supporting heart health by preventing oxidation and aiding in the detoxification of substances like hydrogen peroxide and mercury.

Selenium is essential for thyroid function, facilitating the conversion of inactive thyroid hormone (T4) to its active form (T3), including reverse T3. It also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, reduces the risk of male infertility, and can help decrease thyroid antibodies in autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Good dietary sources of selenium include Brazil nuts, tuna, halibut, sardines, salmon, organ meats, meat, and eggs.
