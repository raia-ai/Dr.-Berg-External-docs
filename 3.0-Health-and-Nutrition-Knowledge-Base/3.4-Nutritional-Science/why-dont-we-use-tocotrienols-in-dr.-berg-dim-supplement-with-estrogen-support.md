# Why don't we use tocotrienols in Dr. Berg DIM Supplement with Estrogen Support?

we used D-Alpha Tocopheryl instead of tocotrienols due to the extremely high cost of tocotrienols. This decision was made to keep the product affordable for consumers, and Dr. Berg considers D-Alpha Tocopheryl succinate a beneficial alternative.
