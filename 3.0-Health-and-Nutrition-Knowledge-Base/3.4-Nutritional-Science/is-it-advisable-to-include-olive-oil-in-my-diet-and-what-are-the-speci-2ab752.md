# Is it advisable to include olive oil in my diet, and what are the specific health benefits associated with its consumption?

**Olive oil is rich in antioxidants and has anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. Olive oil also has incredible effects on certain parts of the body, including:**

• The cardiovascular system

• The nerves and brain

• The skin

• The eyes

Olive oil is a good source of healthy fats and contains vitamins E and K1. However, the real benefits of olive oil occur because of a group of plant chemicals called polyphenols. Polyphenols produce many amazing effects on the body, like helping to prevent complications from chronic disease and oxidative stress.
**It’s crucial to get real olive oil that’s organic.** This is because glyphosate (an herbicide) blocks a plant’s ability to produce amino acids and polyphenols. Glyphosate can also lead to a myriad of other health concerns.

Keep in mind that salads contain polyphenols and other phytonutrients. Plus, adding olive oil to salads helps increase the absorption of phytonutrients.
