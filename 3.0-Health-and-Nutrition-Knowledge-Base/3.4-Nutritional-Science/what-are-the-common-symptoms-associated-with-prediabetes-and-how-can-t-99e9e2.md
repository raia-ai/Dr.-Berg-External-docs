# What are the common symptoms associated with prediabetes, and how can these signs vary in intensity among different individuals?

**Prediabetes symptoms:**

1\. Darkened skin (in the body folds)

2\. Poor memory

3\. Tired after eating 

4\. Belly fat

5\. Hunger and cravings 

6\. Slow healing 

7\. Urination at night/increased thirst

8\. Dry mouth 

9\. Itchy

10\. Blurred vision 

The thing is, you could have all of these symptoms, and your blood sugar levels may still not be high. This is because, way before you get diabetes or even prediabetes, you have high insulin. You probably have high insulin from consuming a high-carb diet and eating too frequently. 

Too much insulin is toxic, so you will develop insulin resistance. This can go on for years until you eventually develop prediabetes and then diabetes.
