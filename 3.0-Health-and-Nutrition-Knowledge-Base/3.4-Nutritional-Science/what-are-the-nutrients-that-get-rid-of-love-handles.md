# What are the nutrients that get rid of love handles?

First, I want to emphasize one important point. Love handles are a result of high levels of insulin. When your insulin is high, you cannot burn fat, and your body increases fat storage. The following nutrients help support healthy insulin levels, which promotes fat-burning. In turn, this will significantly reduce your love handles and belly fat.

**Take a look at these 7 nutrients that will help you lower your insulin and get rid of love handles.**

1\. Potassium - You can get potassium from beet tops, greens, and avocado.

2\. Vitamin D - You can get vitamin D from the sun, cod liver oil, egg yolks, and mushrooms.

3\. Fiber - You can get fiber from healthy low-carb vegetables.

4\. MCTs (medium-chain triglycerides) - You can get MCTs from coconut oil and other MCT oils.

5\. Magnesium - You can get magnesium from pumpkin seeds, spinach, chard, and almonds.

6\. Vitamin B1 - You can get vitamin B1 from sunflower seeds and nutritional yeast.

7\. Chromium - You can get chromium from broccoli and nutritional yeast.

Give these foods a try and let me know how they work for you.
