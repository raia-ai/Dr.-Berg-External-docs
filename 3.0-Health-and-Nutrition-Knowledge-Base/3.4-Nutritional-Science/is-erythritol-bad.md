# Is erythritol bad?

A new study on erythritol and heart attacks has been in the news and found its way to social media—let’s talk about it. This study correlates erythritol in your blood to higher incidents of heart attacks and strokes. However, I see some serious problems with this study.

Here are four key points about this study:

1\. Correlation does not mean causation.

2\. This study was based on endogenous erythritol and did not measure dietary erythritol. The body makes endogenous erythritol.

3\. The body produces erythritol when you metabolize sugar, have oxidative stress or belly fat, or consume alcohol. The great majority of people in this study were in poor health, so how do we know erythritol was the problem?

4\. Other research has liked erythritol to many different health benefits. Could it be that erythritol is increasing in the body to counter the bad effects of sugar? It seems to me that erythritol is something that’s trying to help you and not hurt you.
