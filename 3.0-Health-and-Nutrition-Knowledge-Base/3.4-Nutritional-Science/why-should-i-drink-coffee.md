# Why should I drink coffee?

**Remember, don’t drink coffee if it gives you anxiety, increases your heart rate, or prevents you from sleeping. Too much coffee can increase cortisol and adrenaline, so limit your daily coffee intake to one cup.**

**Caffeine is a phytochemical found in coffee and other plants.** Caffeine keeps us awake by inhibiting a compound called adenosine.
