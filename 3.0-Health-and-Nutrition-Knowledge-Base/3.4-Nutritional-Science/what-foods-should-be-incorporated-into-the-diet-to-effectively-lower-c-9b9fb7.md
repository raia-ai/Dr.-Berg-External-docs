# What foods should be incorporated into the diet to effectively lower cholesterol levels, and how do their specific nutrients contribute to heart health and improved lipid profiles?

However, keep in mind that if you have a genetic problem called familial hypercholesterolemia or if you are a hyper responder, this information will not apply.

**Health benefits of cholesterol:**

• It helps make hormones

• It helps make vitamin D

• It supports cell membranes

• It supports the brain

• It supports the immune system

• It’s needed to make bile salts

Egg yolks are one of the highest sources of cholesterol-mobilizing nutrients: choline and lecithin. One egg gives you about 186 mg of cholesterol. But, the body makes about 3000 mg of cholesterol a day. Dietary cholesterol isn’t associated with increased cholesterol. There are also no studies that show that consuming eggs negatively affects the cardiovascular system. In one study, they found that certain phytonutrients in eggs improved the cholesterol profile in a group of people on a low-carb diet. Egg yolks are also loaded with vitamin K2, which supports a healthy heart.

Grass-fed butter also has an incredible influence over cholesterol, and if you can find cultured butter, then that’s even better. Cultured butter has the added benefit of friendly bacteria that help boost the benefits of butter.

Your friendly microbes make bile salts, which help mobilize and regulate cholesterol. Butter is also a good source of vitamin K2 and is great for anyone going through menopause because cholesterol is needed to support hormones. One study shows that butter has a neutral association with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Beta-carotene, which is high in butter, may also help lower cholesterol. Butter is also rich in CLA, butyric acid, and omega-3 fatty acids, which may benefit healthy cholesterol.
