# Which is better, erythritol or allulose?

Whether erythritol or allulose is better depends on the desired use. Erythritol has a stronger taste and cooling effect that can quickly overpower a sugary recipe. However, itâ€™s a great sweetener for tea and coffee. Allulose is generally recommended for baking as it melts and caramelizes similarly to sugar and can be used at a one-to-one ratio in most recipes.
