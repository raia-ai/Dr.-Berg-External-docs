# How can I prevent cramping and nail splitting during prolonged fasts?

Biotin would help. That usually comes from the gut. It's in the category of B vitamins, but also silicon also is good for nail cracking. But I would look at both of those being a problem, especially if you're doing fasting, you're probably going to add some supplement to that.

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do *not* encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provide this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast.  If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**
