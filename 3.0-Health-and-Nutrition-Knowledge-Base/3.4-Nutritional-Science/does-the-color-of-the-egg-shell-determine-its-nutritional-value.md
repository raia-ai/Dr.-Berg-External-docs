# Does the color of the egg shell determine its nutritional value?

The color of an egg's shell does not affect its nutritional value. Brown eggs are more expensive primarily due to the larger breeds of hens that lay them, which require more feed. This increases production costs. In essence, the price difference is about the chicken, not the egg's health benefits.
