# How can I stop overeating and be satisfied with food?

**There are three things I’ve covered on this topic before:**

1\. Consume more fat

2\. Eat nutrient-dense foods

3\. Support healthy digestion

The above three things are important. But the best way to satisfy hunger and stop overeating is to consume the right amount of protein. One study found that certain insects will continue to eat until their protein requirements are met. If you put these insects on a low-protein diet, they will overeat. However, you don’t want to consume too much protein. Excess protein is not stored and will convert to sugar. The right amount of protein will give your body what it needs without converting to sugar or fat.
