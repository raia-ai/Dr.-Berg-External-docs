# What are the primary causes and risk factors associated with diverticulitis, and how do dietary and lifestyle choices contribute to its development?

Diverticulitis is an inflammation of the little pouches (diverticula) in your colon. It can create a lot of abdominal pain and discomfort in the body.

**Cause #1: Consuming foods that are inflammatory**

If you consume a lot of refined carbs and GMO foods, as well as oils containing omega-6 fatty acids, these things can cause a lot of problems throughout the body--including the inside of your colon. This is because these types of foods create inflammation. Snacking often and consuming a lot of carbs in general will increase the quantity of insulin, an inflammatory hormone, in your blood.
