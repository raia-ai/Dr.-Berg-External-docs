# What is the importance of zinc for overall health?

Zinc is involved in a vast number of biochemical processes in the body, estimated to be over 200. This underscores its fundamental importance for overall health. While the immediate effects of zinc supplementation may not always be pronounced, adequate zinc intake contributes significantly to long-term well-being, potentially evidenced by stronger nails and hair. Furthermore, zinc deficiency is linked to low testosterone levels in men. Given that environmental factors, such as certain chemicals from plastics, can disrupt hormonal balance, maintaining sufficient zinc may play a supportive role in preserving hormonal health.
