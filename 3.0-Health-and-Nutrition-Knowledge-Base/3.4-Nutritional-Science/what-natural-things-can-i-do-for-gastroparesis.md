# What natural things can I do for gastroparesis?

Gastroparesis, characterized by delayed stomach emptying, often arises from vagus nerve dysfunction linked to thiamine (B1) deficiency. Thiamine is essential for acetylcholine production, vital for vagus nerve function. Insufficient B1 can lead to symptoms like gastroparesis, constipation, and low stomach acid, impairing digestion.

Addressing B1 deficiency through natural supplementation and dietary adjustments is crucial. Avoiding refined carbs, sugars, and excessive caffeine supports B1 levels. Monitoring B1 supplementation effects can potentially alleviate gastroparesis symptoms and enhance digestive health. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
