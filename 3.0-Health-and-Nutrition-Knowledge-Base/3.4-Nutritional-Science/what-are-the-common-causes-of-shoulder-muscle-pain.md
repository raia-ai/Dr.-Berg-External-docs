# What are the common causes of shoulder muscle pain?

Shoulder muscle pain is often caused by referred pain, which is related to your liver and gallbladder. Junk food and alcohol intake are the major causes of damaging your liver and causing fatty liver disease. Many nutrient deficiencies can cause liver and gallbladder problems.

The best things for shoulder pain are:

• Eating a healthy diet

• Cutting out alcohol

• Taking care of your liver and gallbladder

• Consuming bitter cruciferous vegetables

• Consuming beet tops

The Liver is the only organ that can regenerate itself with time. However, many liver symptoms don’t show up until 90% of your liver is shot. At this point, the damage cannot be reversed. Take care of your liver now to avoid problems later.
