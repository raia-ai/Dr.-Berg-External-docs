# What strategies can be employed to address adrenal fatigue through improved sleep management?

The medical profession doesn’t recognize adrenal fatigue as an actual condition. But, this doesn’t make sense. If a person has too much adrenal function, this is called Cushing’s disease, and if you don’t have enough adrenal hormones, this is called Addison’s disease. So, why couldn’t someone develop wear and tear, breakdown, or fatigue of the adrenal glands? 

**The two big symptoms of adrenal fatigue are:**

1\. Chronic fatigue 

2\. Chronic inflammation 

The most important thing you can do for adrenal fatigue is to get more sleep. Sleep helps improve stress. It’s not always just about the diet. In this situation, it’s about recovering and restoring sleep. 

**A few main causes of poor sleep:**

• Pain and inflammation (take vitamin D) 

• Nightmares (take nutritional yeast) 

• EMF 

• A high pulse rate or high blood pressure (take potassium, magnesium, and vitamin D)

• Heart arrhythmias (Take potassium, magnesium, berberine, quinine, and forskolin) 

**A few more things that may help:**

• Long walks

• Lower your carbohydrates 

• Go to sleep when you’re tired 

• Take naps 

• Isolate what’s causing your stress and do what you can to improve your stress
