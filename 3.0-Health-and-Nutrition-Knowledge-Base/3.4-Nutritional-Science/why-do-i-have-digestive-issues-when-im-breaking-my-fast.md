# Why do I have digestive issues when I’m breaking my fast?

This could happen because, basically, your digestive system has gone to sleep and it hasn’t woken yet. You don’t want to eat a large meal after a long fast because you will overload your system. You need to start small.

After a long fast, you may also want to take certain things, such as:

- Apple cider vinegar (ACV) or betaine hydrochloride

- Bile salts

- Enzymes

- Probiotics

Foods to avoid after a long fast:

- Nuts and nut butters

- Red meat

- Raw cruciferous vegetables

- Dairy products
