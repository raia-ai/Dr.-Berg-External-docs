# How often should I do Intermittent Fasting?

Intermittent fasting offers several schedules, each with its own benefits. The 16:8 method involves fasting for 16 hours and eating within an 8-hour window, typically with two meals. Alternatively, the 20:4 schedule extends the fasting period to 20 hours, followed by a 4-hour eating window, offering additional benefits for brain function, heart health, repair, and anti-aging. OMAD (One Meal A Day) condenses eating into a single daily meal, sometimes necessitating alternate-day OMAD for optimal results. While intermittent fasting, it's advisable to combine it with a healthy ketogenic diet. Try to start with three meals a day without snacking, gradually transition to fewer meals, and listen to your hunger cues so that you can adjust your intermittent fasting plan to best suit your needs.
