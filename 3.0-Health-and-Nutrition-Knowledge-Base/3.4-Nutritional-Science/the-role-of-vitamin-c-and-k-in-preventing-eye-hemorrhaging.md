# The Role of Vitamin C and K in Preventing Eye Hemorrhaging

### **The Role of Vitamin C and K in Preventing Eye Hemorrhaging**

Vitamins C and K play a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of the blood vessels in your eyes. When you don't get enough of these essential nutrients, the tiny capillaries in your eyes can become weak and prone to leaking or even hemorrhaging.

This can lead to some scary symptoms like sudden vision changes, floaters, or even blind spots. So if you notice any unexplained bleeding in your eyes, it could be a sign of a vitamin C or K deficiency that needs to be addressed ASAP.

### **Addressing Light Sensitivity Through Nutrition**

Do you find yourself squinting or shielding your eyes from bright lights? [Vitamin B1, also known as thiamine](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-b1-thiamine-deficiency-signs-symptoms-and-treatment-benefits), could be the missing link. This essential nutrient plays a crucial role in managing light sensitivity issues.

When you're deficient in vitamin B1, your eyes may struggle to adapt to changes in lighting, leading to discomfort and even pain in bright environments.

### **Nutritional Causes of Night Blindness**

If you have trouble seeing clearly in low-light conditions, a deficiency in vitamin A could be to blame. This vital nutrient is essential for producing rhodopsin, a pigment in the retina that helps you see in the dark.

Without enough vitamin A, your eyes may struggle to adjust to dim lighting, leading to night blindness and difficulty navigating in the dark. In rare cases, night blindness can also result from arsenic poisoning, which can interfere with vitamin A metabolism.

So if you're dealing with night vision issues, boosting your intake of vitamin A-rich foods like sweet potatoes, carrots, and leafy greens could make a big difference.

The bottom line? A proper diet rich in essential vitamins and minerals is crucial for maintaining healthy eyes and vision.

By being mindful of these common nutritional deficiencies and addressing them through diet and supplementation, you can give your eyes the support they need to function at their best for years to come.
