# What foods should I eat to make fasting easier?

When youâ€™re fasting, anything you consume other than water will break your fast to some degree. But, some food items you can consume will have a very minor effect on your ability to get back into fasting. The biggest things that will break your fast are refined carbs or sugar.

Making sure you have enough nutrients while fasting is critical, as this will make it easier. Some things you can consume to make fasting easier are MCT oil (can add it to coffee), electrolytes (be sure there are no added sugars), probiotics, B vitamins, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, sea salt, amino acid blends, and kombucha tea.
