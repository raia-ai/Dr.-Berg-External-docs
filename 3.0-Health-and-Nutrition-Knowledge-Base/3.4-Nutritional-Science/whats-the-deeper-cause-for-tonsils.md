# What's the deeper cause for tonsils?

The presence of tonsil stones, which cause unpleasant mouth odor, is rooted in the role of tonsils as lymphatic tissues defending against pathogens. Removal of tonsils can lead to complications such as respiratory infections, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and autoimmune disorders, as antibiotics often prove ineffective against viral tonsil infections. Strengthening the immune system is crucial to prevent tonsil stones, while promoting natural immune development in children through exposure to infections can enhance overall immune resilience. Nutrient deficiencies, especially in vitamin D, zinc, and iron, contribute to inflamed tonsils, making adequate intake of these nutrients essential through diet or supplements. Vitamin D's antimicrobial properties are particularly beneficial, emphasizing the importance of outdoor exposure and a balanced diet for optimal tonsil health.
