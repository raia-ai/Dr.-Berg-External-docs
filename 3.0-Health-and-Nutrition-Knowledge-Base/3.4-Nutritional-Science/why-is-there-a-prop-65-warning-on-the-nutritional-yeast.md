# Why is There a Prop 65 Warning on the Nutritional Yeast?

Here's a rewrite focusing on transparency and customer reassurance:

**Important Information About a Recent Test Result**

We recently discovered that one batch of our Nutritional Yeast exceeded the California Proposition 65 (Prop 65) lead limit. As a result, we've added a Prop 65 warning label to this specific batch.

We understand this label can be concerning. Here's why it's important to know:

- **Safety First:** We take product safety very seriously and conduct thorough third-party testing.

- **Prop 65 and Lead Limits:** Prop 65 has extremely low thresholds for lead that are intended for potential long-term exposure in industrial settings. The actual lead level in this batch is very low and well within safe limits for consumption.

- **Dr. Berg Explains Prop 65:** For a more detailed explanation of Prop 65 and lead levels, you can watch this video by Dr. Berg: Insert YouTube video.
