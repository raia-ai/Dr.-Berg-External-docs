# What are the primary causes of tetany?

Muscle twitches or tetany are erratic little nerve impulses that can start anywhere in your body. They usually go away pretty quickly.

**Cause #1: Nutrient deficiency**

If you have a certain electrolyte deficiency--specifically calcium and magnesium--you can have muscle twitches at different places in your body. These electrolytes are responsible for normal functioning of the body, including relaxation of muscles.

Additionally, manganese is needed for a certain part of the brain that is involved in suppressing abnormal muscle movement. If you are deficient in it, you can also experience tetany.

**Cause #2: Alkalosis**

If you have a too-alkaline body pH it can result in tetany. The reason behind this is that when your body pH is higher than it should be, it can result in inability to correctly utilize calcium that is in your body. Calcium is an electrolyte that is needed for healthy muscle function in the body. The solution would be to acidify your body.
