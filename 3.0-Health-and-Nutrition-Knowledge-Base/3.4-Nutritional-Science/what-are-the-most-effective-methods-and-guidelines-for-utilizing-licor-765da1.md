### **How to Use Licorice Extract for Best Results**

To use licorice extract to fade sunspots, look for a skincare product that contains a high concentration of the ingredient. You can find licorice extract in serums, creams, and even face masks.

Apply the product directly to your sunspots once or twice a day, being careful to avoid the delicate skin around your eyes. You should start to see results within a few days to a few weeks, depending on the severity of your sunspots.

Want to banish dark spots for good? Licorice extract is a great start, but don't stop there. Amp up your skincare routine with vitamin C, kojic acid, and niacinamide â€“ they're like the ultimate dream team for evening out your skin tone.
