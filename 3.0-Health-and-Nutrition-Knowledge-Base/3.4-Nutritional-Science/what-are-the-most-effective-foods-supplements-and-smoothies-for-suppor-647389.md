# What are the most effective foods, supplements, and smoothies for supporting liver detoxification and cleansing?

The liver doesn’t hold or store toxins—it gets rid of toxins. When we’re talking about a liver cleanse, we’re talking about getting rid of fat, inflammation, and scar tissue in the liver. These things weaken the ability of the liver to detox. The liver is the only organ that can completely regenerate, but there is a point of limitation.

Keep in mind that you can get rid of 50 percent of the fat in the liver just by going on a low-carb diet. You don’t need to get on a low-fat diet, but a low-carb diet is crucial. Alcohol consumption can lead to fatty liver disease. But, one of the top causes of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is fructose.
