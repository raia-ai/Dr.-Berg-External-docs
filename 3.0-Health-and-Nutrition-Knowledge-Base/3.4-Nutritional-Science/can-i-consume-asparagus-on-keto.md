# Can I consume asparagus on keto?

Yes. It has a lot of nutritional benefits:

- Prebiotic – a fiber that doesn’t break down until it hits the large intestines; the microbes in the large intestines live on this fiber, which helps you build up your friendly bacteria

- High in vitamin K, folate, and B1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 – good for stress and energy and calming your nervous system down

- High in phosphorus – a great way to improve your energy

- Diuretic – gets rid of excess fluids because asparagus is low in sodium and high in potassium so it is a mild kidney detoxifier

- Protection from kidney stones and dissolving them

- High in chromium – a mineral that helps repair insulin resistance. It makes your cells more insulin-sensitive, helping nutrients to go through the cell wall and regulating glucose. Great for diabetics, good for hypoglycemic people, and definitely helps insulin resistance
