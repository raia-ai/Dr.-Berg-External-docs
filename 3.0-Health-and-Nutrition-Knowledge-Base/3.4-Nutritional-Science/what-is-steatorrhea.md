# What is steatorrhea?

Steatorrhea is a condition characterized by excess fat in the stool, which can make the stool appear oily, greasy, and unusually foul-smelling. This occurs when the body cannot properly digest or absorb fats from the diet. Common symptoms associated with steatorrhea include stools that float due to their high-fat content are sticky and may leave skid marks on the toilet. This condition can indicate underlying issues such as pancreatic enzyme deficiency, problems with bile secretion, or other digestive disorders.
