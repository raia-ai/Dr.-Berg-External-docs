# What is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and what are its essential functions in cellular metabolism, energy production, and overall health?

Discover the secrets to youthful longevity and vitality by unlocking the power of your body's energy factories - the mitochondria. Their health directly influences how you age, and a key player in their function is NAD, a vital nutrient involved in energy production.

NAD not only helps prevent muscle loss, especially in cancer patients, but also shields against radiation damage. However, NAD levels naturally decline as we age. Fortunately, research has shown that certain compounds can boost NAD and slow down the aging process.

Here are 5 compounds that can naturally increase NAD levels and promote a longer, healthier life:

1. **Apigenin:** Found in parsley, thyme, oregano, basil, and celery.

2. **Anthoxanthin:** Enjoy blueberries, elderberries, concord grapes, purple potatoes, and other colorful blue, purple, or red foods.

3. **Curcumin:** The active compound in turmeric.

4. **Quercetin:** Abundant in onions (especially the outer layers) and apple skin.

5. **Methylene blue:** This historical drug can effectively boost NAD levels.

By incorporating these NAD-boosting compounds into your diet, you can support mitochondrial health, slow down aging, and enjoy a more vibrant and youthful life.
