# Which alcohol is the most dehydrating?

Drinks with higher alcohol content, including vodka, whiskey, and rum, can have a stronger dehydrating effect than beverages with lower alcohol content, such as beer or wine. In addition, cocktails with sugary mixers or caffeinated alcoholic beverages can amplify fluid loss and worsen alcohol-related dehydration.
