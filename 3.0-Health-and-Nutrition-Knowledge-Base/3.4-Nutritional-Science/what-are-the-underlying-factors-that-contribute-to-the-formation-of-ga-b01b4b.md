# What are the underlying factors that contribute to the formation of gallstones?

Gallstones are really cholesterol stones. This situation isn’t really caused be consuming too much cholesterol. The real cause may be that you don’t have enough bile to break down cholesterol stones.  Bile is made in the liver and is stored in the gallbladder. Bile helps you dissolve fats in your diet. A low bile situation is actually a symptom of something else.

Low bile could be a symptom of:

• Excess estrogen 

• Excess cortisol 

• Excess insulin 

• Low-fat diets 

• Constipation 

To help dissolve the stones, you would want to increase your bile by pinpointing what’s causing the low bile situation and correcting your diet. In the meantime, bile salt also dissolves gallstones.
