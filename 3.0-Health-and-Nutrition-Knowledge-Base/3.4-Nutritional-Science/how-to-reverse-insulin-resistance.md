# How to reverse insulin resistance?

Insulin resistance is a condition where the cells are no longer absorbing insulin. The average person with insulin resistance has 5-7 times more insulin than normal. Adopting the Healthy Keto® diet provides the key nutrients and adjustments you need to begin reducing insulin resistance. If you want to enhance your results, you can:

• Add exercise

• Lower your stress

• Get more sleep

• Get plenty of nutrients (zinc, vitamin D, chromium, potassium, magnesium)
