# Boosting Your Immune System Naturally: Vitamin D vs. Prednisone

**Boosting Your Immune System Naturally: Vitamin D vs. Prednisone**

Your immune system is a complex network with two main components:

- **Innate Immunity:** Your body's first line of defense, present from birth.

- **Acquired Immunity:** Develops over time as you encounter various infections.

Autoimmune diseases arise from problems with the "peacekeepers" of your immune system, called T-regulatory cells or T-cells. These cells are crucial for turning off the immune response once a threat is neutralized.

While prednisone, a synthetic cortisol, is often used to treat autoimmune diseases, it suppresses both parts of your immune system. **Vitamin D offers a different approach:**

- **Empowers Immunity:** Unlike prednisone, vitamin D enhances your immune system, particularly increasing T-cell production.

- **Reduces Inflammation:** Vitamin D suppresses inflammatory cells (TH1 and TH17), which are often overactive in autoimmune conditions.

- **Blood Sugar Control:** Prednisone can raise blood sugar levels, while vitamin D actually helps regulate them and supports insulin production.

- **Bone Health:** Prednisone can weaken bones, but vitamin D promotes calcium absorption and bone health.

- **Thymus Support:** The thymus gland, responsible for T-cell production, declines with age. Vitamin D helps slow this decline, but requires therapeutic doses and essential cofactors like magnesium, vitamin K2, and zinc.

**The Coimbra Protocol:**

Dr. Coimbra in Brazil developed a protocol using high doses of vitamin D to overcome resistance and significantly increase its levels in the body. This, in turn, lowers parathyroid hormone and helps manage autoimmune conditions.

**Key Takeaway:**

Vitamin D offers a natural way to support and modulate your immune system, unlike prednisone which suppresses it. Consult with a healthcare professional to determine if vitamin D therapy is right for you.
