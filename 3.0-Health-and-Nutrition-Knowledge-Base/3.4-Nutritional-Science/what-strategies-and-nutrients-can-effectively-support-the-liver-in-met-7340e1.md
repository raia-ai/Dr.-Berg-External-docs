# What strategies and nutrients can effectively support the liver in metabolizing and eliminating alcohol?

There are various natural remedies that promote liver function and protect liver cells from the detrimental effects of acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolic by-product of alcohol detoxification. You can support alcohol detoxification by consuming a healthy diet rich in egg yolks, organ meats, green leafy vegetables, broccoli sprouts, and turmeric and taking liver-cleansing supplements, including milk thistle, CoQ10, and astaxanthin.
