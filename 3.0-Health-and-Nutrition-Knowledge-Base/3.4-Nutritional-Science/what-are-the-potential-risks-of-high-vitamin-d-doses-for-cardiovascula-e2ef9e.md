# What are the potential risks of high Vitamin D doses for cardiovascular health?

**Vitamin D, Calcium, and Arterial Health**

While excessive vitamin D (hypervitaminosis D) can sometimes raise blood calcium levels, research suggests a more complex relationship with heart health:

- **Potential Risk:** Very high vitamin D levels could, in some cases, contribute to calcification of the arteries.

- **Protective Effects:** Studies indicate an inverse correlation between vitamin D and coronary artery calcification. This means increasing vitamin D within appropriate ranges may help reduce calcification and arterial stiffness.

- **The Role of Vitamin K2:** Vitamin K2 works alongside vitamin D, ensuring calcium is properly deposited in bones and teeth, not soft tissues like arteries.
