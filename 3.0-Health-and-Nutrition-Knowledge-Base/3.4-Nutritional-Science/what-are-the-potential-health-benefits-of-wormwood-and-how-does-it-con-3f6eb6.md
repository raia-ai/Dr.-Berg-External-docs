# What are the potential health benefits of wormwood, and how does it contribute to overall well-being?

This natural herb has been used for thousands of years in Chinese medicine. The synthetic version of wormwood is the most effective treatment for malaria. There is also some interesting research on wormwood for COVID.

**Other potential benefits of wormwood:**

• It’s anti-parasitic

• It may be effective against worms, viruses, bacteria, and Lyme disease

• It’s anti-viral

**What we’re going to focus on today, though, is its effectiveness against cancer.**

**Potential benefits of wormwood for cancer patients:**

1\. It can selectively cause apoptosis in cancer cells.

2\. It oxidizes a small amount of your iron, turning it into a free radical and directing it to the cancer cell. Oxidized iron is toxic to cancer cells.

3\. The phytonutrients in wormwood can inhibit a certain protein complex involved in the process of normal cells converting into cancer cells.

4\. It can inhibit normal cells from producing an increase in blood vessels to a tumor.

5\. It’s anti-inflammatory and may help stop the formation and spread of cancer. 6. It has an anti-metastatic effect, which means it may help inhibit the growth of cancer.
