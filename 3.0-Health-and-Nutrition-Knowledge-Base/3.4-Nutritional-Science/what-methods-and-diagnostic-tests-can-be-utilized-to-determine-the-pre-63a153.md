# What methods and diagnostic tests can be utilized to determine the presence of a bowel disease?

Bowel disease typically relates to your microbes. You have trillions of microbes in your gut, and there could be an alteration in the amounts or types of these microbes. Fiber is important to help feed your microbes. However, even though many people might disagree, whole grains are not a healthy source of fiber.

A lot of the microbes in your gut can actually morph from neutral to bad. This can happen when the environment of your gut changes.

**How to test for gut problems at home:**

**Step 1:** Eliminate all fiber from your diet for three days

**Step 2:** Add the fiber back into your diet for three days

**Step 3:** Compare how you felt while you were consuming fiber and while you weren’t

If fiber is causing your gut problems and you have to cut it out, your microbes can still survive. If your body doesn’t function well with fiber—don’t consume it. Fermented foods are fantastic for supporting your microbes. If you want to eventually introduce fiber back into your diet, try foods containing fermented fiber, like sauerkraut and kimchi.
