# What factors contribute to the presence of an ammonia odor during ketosis?

Ammonia is a chemical byproduct of protein metabolism. When your digestive system functions normally, ammonia converts to less toxic byproducts. If you have excess ammonia levels, it means that something is not functioning right. As a result you may develop a strong ammonia body odor that comes out in your breath, urine, or sweat.

**Cause #1: Acidosis**

An ammonia odor can be caused by acidosis. Acidosis occurs when your body is too acidic. To alkalize the blood, your body can compensate with ammonia, which is highly alkaline. This situation may happen when youâ€™re adapting to ketosis.

**Cause #3: Excess protein consumption**

Sometimes a strong ammonia odor can simply be due to consuming excess protein, because ammonia is a byproduct of protein. Consuming more moderate amounts of protein should help.
