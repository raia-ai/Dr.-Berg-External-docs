# Turmeric Ginger Tea Discontinued

We want to inform you that Dr. Berg Nutritionals has discontinued the Turmeric Ginger Tea. While we understand this may come as a disappointment, we encourage you to research the many high-quality turmeric and ginger teas available through other trusted retailers. While we do not have a specific brand recommendation, here are a few best practices based on Dr. Berg’s health principles:

- **Choose organic:** Look for teas made with organic turmeric and ginger to avoid harmful pesticides and additives.

- **Check the ingredient list:** Avoid teas with added sugars, artificial flavors, or preservatives. Simplicity is key—just turmeric, ginger, and maybe a touch of natural herbs like cinnamon or lemon.

- **Opt for loose-leaf or high-quality tea bags:** This often ensures a more potent and less processed product.

- **Know your source:** Choose brands that are transparent about their sourcing and third-party testing for purity.

- **Consider synergy:** Some blends include black pepper (piperine), which may enhance turmeric’s absorption—an approach aligned with Dr. Berg’s focus on bioavailability.
