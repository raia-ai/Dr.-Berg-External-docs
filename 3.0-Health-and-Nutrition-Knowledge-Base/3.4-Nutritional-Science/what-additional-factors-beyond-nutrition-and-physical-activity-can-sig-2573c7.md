# What additional factors, beyond nutrition and physical activity, can significantly impact bone health and contribute to the overall maintenance of skeletal integrity?

Beyond nutrients, other elements can influence bone health:

- Hormones: Hormones like estrogen play a crucial role in bone health. A decline in estrogen, common during menopause, can contribute to bone loss. Itâ€™s a reminder that hormonal balance is a critical factor in maintaining optimal bone density, especially for women.

- Cortisol: High cortisol, often associated with [chronic stress](https://www.drberg.com/blog/chronic-stress-literally-destroys-immunity), can negatively impact your bones, affecting density and strength. Remember that managing stress is not only beneficial for your mental well-being but also for the long-term health of your skeletal system.

- Metabolic Health: Individuals with bone loss, including [osteoporosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-taking-calcium-may-not-prevent-osteoporosis), often experience underlying metabolic concerns that reach beyond just [calcium deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-causes-and-symptoms-of-calcium-deficiency). These may include conditions like insulin resistance or nutrient absorption issues.
