# How can I use my feet to determine if I have an ongoing health condition?

The foot receives oxygen and nutrition from the heart through tiny capillaries. The following feet symptoms are also potential signs of diseases.

1\. Peripheral neuropathy

This shows up as numbness or burning in the feet due to low vitamin B1 (thiamine). Benfotiamine, a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1, may help.

2\. Fingers or toes turn blue

This can be related to an overactive sympathetic nervous system. This is often treated medically with calcium channel blockers. Magnesium is a natural calcium channel blocker and the primary regulator of calcium inside the cells. Magnesium glycinate is the most absorbable form of magnesium.

3\. Foot cramps

Foot cramps and charlie horses in the calves are among the earliest signs of magnesium deficiency. Try taking 400 to 800 mg of magnesium glycinate for several weeks to alleviate foot cramps.

4\. Swollen feet

Swelling of feet typically involves diabetes and excess sugar in the blood, which causes sodium and water retention. The solution is to remove sugar from the diet.

5\. Discoloration of lower legs and feet

This is often caused by a circulation problem. Deep vein thrombosis is a condition where you develop clots in the veins of the lower legs. This can cause fluid retention and discoloration of the lower legs and feet.

6\. Big toe pain

Pain in the big toe is usually a symptom of gout caused by too much uric acid. Decreasing oxalates in the diet can sometimes solve this problem. Magnesium can also help decrease oxalates.
