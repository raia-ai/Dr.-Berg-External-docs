## **Nutritional Deficiencies Leading to Depression**

Depression can be more than a mere emotional; it may also have physical health connections. In many cases, it's also closely linked to our physical health. One overlooked factor that can cause depression is nutritional deficiencies.

Vital nutrients like vitamin B12, iron, and [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-3-fatty-acids-reduce-insulin-resistance) are crucial in maintaining brain health and mood stability. A deficiency in any of these essential elements could trigger depressive symptoms.

Studies have found that people with low levels of vitamin B12 are twice as likely to be severely depressed compared to those with normal levels.

Remember: This doesn't mean popping pills will fix your mood overnight. The body needs a nutritious diet for optimal functioning; relying solely on supplements won't cut it.
