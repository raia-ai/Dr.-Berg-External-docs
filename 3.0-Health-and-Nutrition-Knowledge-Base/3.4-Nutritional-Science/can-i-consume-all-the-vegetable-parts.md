# Can I consume all the vegetable parts?

**Utilizing All Parts of Vegetables**

**Broccoli Leaves**

Often discarded, broccoli leaves are highly nutritious, containing more vitamin A, calcium, iron, and vitamin C than the florets. Rich in sulforaphane, they offer notable anti-cancer benefits. Incorporate them into your meals for enhanced nutrition.

**Outer Layers**

Vegetable outer layers, such as cabbage leaves, onion skins, and darker lettuce leaves, are nutrient-dense. They have higher concentrations of antioxidants, fiber, vitamins, and minerals due to increased sunlight exposure during growth. Consider using these parts to maximize nutritional benefits.
