# 7 Foods to Avoid

7 Foods to Ditch for Better Health (and What to Eat Instead)

1. **Liquid Sugar:** Sugary drinks like soda and juice are nutrient robbers, contributing to insulin resistance.

    - **Swap for:** Zevia zero-sugar soda or sparkling water with fruit.

2. **Processed Cheese:** Often containing less than 51% real cheese, these products are loaded with fillers and additives.

    - **Swap for:** Real cheese made from milk, not oil and starch.

3. **Protein Bars:** Many are glorified candy bars, packed with sugar and artificial ingredients.

    - **Swap for:** Boiled eggs, cheese, meat jerky, or homemade protein balls.

4. **Seed Oil Mayonnaise:** Most commercial mayos use inflammatory soy oil.

    - **Swap for:** Avocado oil-based mayo like Chosen Foods or Primal Kitchen.

5. **Sweetened, Flavored Yogurt:** Often contains more sugar than ice cream, plus artificial additives.

    - **Swap for:** Plain whole-fat grass-fed yogurt or kefir from A2 cows, sheep, or goats.

6. **Soy Protein:** Heavily processed and linked to gut and liver issues.

    - **Swap for:** Whole protein sources like meat, eggs, fish, and seafood.

7. **Modified Starches:** Highly processed fillers that spike blood sugar even more than sugar.

    - **Swap for:** Natural starches from butternut squash, beets, plantains, or purple potatoes.
