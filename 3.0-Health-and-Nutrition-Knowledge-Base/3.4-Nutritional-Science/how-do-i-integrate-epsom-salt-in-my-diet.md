# How do I integrate Epsom salt in my diet?

Epsom salt is a naturally occuring mineral salt that has some pretty good antimicrobial and antifungal properties. Overall it’s a very effective and beneficial substance.

**Benefits**

1. Antimicrobial

2. Antifungal

3. Especially good for toenail fungus

4. Epsom salt for toenail fungus

Dissolve two tablespoons of Epsom salt into four cups of water in a bucket. You can boil the water first, although you don’t have to. The main thing is to get the salt dissolved. Keep the water warm, but if you’ve boiled it first be sure to let it cool down to a comfortable temperature.

Soak your feet in this mixture daily for fifteen minutes. Do it for three to four weeks. You’ll see a great improvement. Also use a nail file to get rid of some of the dead toenail because the problem is that the fungus tends to get up underneath the nail and destroys it.

Depending on how infected the nail is, you may find that your dead nail has to come off and then regrow. Or if the infection isn’t too deep, new toenail tissue may just grow to replace the old.
