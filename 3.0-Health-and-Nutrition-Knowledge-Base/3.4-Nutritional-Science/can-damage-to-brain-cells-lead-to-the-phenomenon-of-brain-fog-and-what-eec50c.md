# Can damage to brain cells lead to the phenomenon of brain fog, and what specific mechanisms or conditions might facilitate this cognitive impairment?

Bruises—also known as contusions—happen when the capillaries under your skin have bled internally due to their weakness or due to impact. Bruising is very common, and not typically something to worry about. However, if you bruise very easily, this can be a sign of an underlying issue.

**Cause #1: Nutrient deficiencies**

Vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients are important for the healthy structure of blood vessels and the thickness of your blood. If you have a nutrient deficiency, this can weaken your capillaries or thin your blood, leading to excessive bleeding.

- **Calcium is vital for the healthy structure of your veins and capillaries. If you lack calcium, this can result in bruising easily.**

- **Vitamin D deficiency can cause an inability to absorb calcium, resulting in the above condition.**

- **Lack of vitamin K1. This vitamin helps your blood clot. If you have malabsorption or lack of bile (gallbladder not functioning properly or removed) this will create inability to absorb vitamins K1 and D).**

- **Lack of vitamin C. This has everything to do with keeping your capillaries strong. Without it, you lose collagen that surrounds your capillaries.**

- **Low vitamin B12 and low folate can cause insufficient amounts of thrombocytes (cells that help you with blood clotting.)**
