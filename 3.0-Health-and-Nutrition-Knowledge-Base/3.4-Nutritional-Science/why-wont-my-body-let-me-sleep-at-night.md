# Why won't my body let me sleep at night?

Delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) is a common sleep disorder characterized by an inability to sleep at a conventional bedtime despite feeling tired.   

DSPS is believed to be triggered by a misaligned circadian rhythm which may be caused by an irregular sleep schedule, blue light exposure from digital devices, zinc deficiency, or an overly active nervous system.
