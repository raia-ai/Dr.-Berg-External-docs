# Can I eat hummus on Keto diet?

Yes you can. Itâ€™s an amazing combination of six ingredients:

1\. Olive oil has anti-inflammatory properties, supports the heart, and contains vitamin C.

2\. Lemon helps prevent the formation of kidney stones and contains vitamin C.

3\. Garlic is an antimicrobial.

4\. Sea salt has 75 minerals.

5\. Chickpeas (garbanzo beans), low on the glycemic index, help improve insulin resistance.

6\. Tahini has omega-3. And high methionine, an insoluble fiber that can support the gallbladder and counteract gray hair and depression.

Also, the fat from the olive oil and tahini buffer any type of spike in insulin.
