# What should I do if I continue to experience bloating despite drinking apple cider vinegar?

These are the symptoms of low stomach acid:

● Inability to absorb minerals, leading to a potential deficiency of iron, calcium, or any other minerals

● Decreased ability to absorb amino acids, which can show up as hair loss, loose skin, or incomplete digestion of protein, among other things

● Leaky gut, which can lead to allergies

● Bloating, abdominal pain, and acid reflux

● SIBO, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, when bacteria grow where they shouldn’t, in your small intestine, and whenever you consume fiber or probiotics it gets worse

● An infection in your lower digestive tract

● Constipation or diarrhea

● Sluggish gallbladder

You can take betaine hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar to improve stomach acid. Fasting also helps, as does drinking coffee. But so too does taking vitamin B3 (niacin).

Common symptoms of B3 deficiency include anxiety, depression, fatigue, and skin problems, which the B3 you do have will address first, possibly preventing it from making more stomach acid. There’s a condition called B3 dependency, which may be caused by stress or certain microbes. When you’re stressed, your body oxidizes adrenaline and needs B3 to replenish it. And because tryptophan converts to B3, you need enough stomach acid to do so.

As well, you need B3 to produce the energy called ATP from the mitochondria in your stomach cells. If you think you have low stomach acid, I recommend you take 50 to 100 milligrams of vitamin B3 per day, or more if you’re really stressed.
