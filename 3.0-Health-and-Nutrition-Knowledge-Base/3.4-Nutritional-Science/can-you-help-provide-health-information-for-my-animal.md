# Can you help provide health information for my animal?

Unfortunately, Dr. Berg and the staff at Dr. Berg Nutritionals cannot provide information related to the health of animals. Dr. Berg is very knowledgeable about the human body and human health, but animals have different anatomy and physiology from humans. Any medical or health-related questions should be sent to a veterinarian.
