# How to choose correct fats to add my salads?

Now that you know why fat is essential for nutrient absorption, let's talk about choosing the right types of fat for your salad. Not all fats are created equal when it comes to health benefits.

### **Healthy Fats vs. Low-Fat Dressings**

You might think light or fat-free salad dressings are always better, but scientific research reveals they can block vegetable nutrient absorption.

A [study from Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2012/120619FerruzziSalad.html) found that people who ate salads with fat-free dressing absorbed far less carotenoids and other fat-soluble nutrients than those who used regular salad dressing containing fat.

### **The Best Oils for Salad Dressings**

So, what are the best oils to use in your salad dressing? Experts recommend choosing oils that are high in healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, such as:

- [Avocado oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-benefits-of-avocado-oil)

- Walnut oil

- Flaxseed oil

Good oils do more than aid in nutrient absorptionâ€”they're also vital for heart health. Take olive oil, a favorite in [the Mediterranean diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-the-mediterranean-diet-has-not-worked-for-you), which significantly reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension.

Incorporating healthy fats into your diet, especially in marine fish, can offer extensive nutritional benefits and support overall well-being. These beneficial oils contribute to a proper diet and enhance the flavors of various dishes, making them an essential component of cooking and healthy living.

Focusing on these nutritious fats can help protect your heart and improve your dietary habits for better health outcomes.

On the other hand, it's best to limit saturated fats like butter and [coconut oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/coconut-oil-benefits), as well as highly processed vegetable oils like soybean and canola oil. When consumed in excess, these fats can contribute to inflammation and other health issues.
