# Can increasing my intake of calcium citrate support bone growth, and what should I consider when adjusting my calcium supplementation?

Well peripheral neuropathy is, if you're on supplements for that, then you want to take more calcium for bones, two different problems. To build bone, you really want, it's not just about calcium.

I would recommend having the full array of trace minerals to build bone. **Make sure you have enough of the amino acids, high quality amino acids from animal meats, specifically red meat. And then also, you definitely need calcium for sure, but also the vitamins that help the calcium go into the bones, like vitamin K2.**

And so where do you get that? **That's from sauerkraut, cheese, which then you can also get the calcium as well, fatty liver, things like that, that'll give you the K2. And of course, don't forget vitamin D, so you can get that from the sun, a cow liver oil, or a supplement. Those are the things that I would focus on if you want to strengthen the bone.**

**Of course the peripheral neuropathy, that would be a combination of benfotiamine and alpha lipoic acid.**
