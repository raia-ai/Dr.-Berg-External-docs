# Is buffalo mozzarella healthier than standard mozzarella?

Whether buffalo mozzarella is healthier than standard mozzarella depends largely on the quality and production methods. Authentic buffalo mozzarella, particularly from regions in Italy where traditional practices are upheld, often has higher nutritional value and superior taste due to the use of raw milk and artisanal techniques. In contrast, much of the cheese produced in the U.S. may involve shortcuts, which can affect quality. When choosing mozzarella, itâ€™s important to seek out products with transparent sourcing and traditional methods, as these factors significantly influence the health benefits and overall quality of the cheese.
