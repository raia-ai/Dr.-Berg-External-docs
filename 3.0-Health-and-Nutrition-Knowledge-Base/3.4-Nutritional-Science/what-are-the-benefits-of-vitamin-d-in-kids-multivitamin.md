# What are the benefits of Vitamin D in Kids Multivitamin?

**Kids Multivitamin - Vitamin D (cholecalciferol)**  

Vitamin D is an essential nutrient. 

Here are some of the key benefits of including vitamin D in a children's multivitamin:  

- **Calcium absorption:** Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, an essential mineral for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, along with a healthy diet and exercise, are important factors in supporting bone health. 

- **Immune Function:** Vitamin D supports healthy immune function. 

- **Cell growth and development:** Vitamin D is involved in cell growth and development, which are essential processes for children's overall health. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep are also important factors in supporting healthy growth. 

- **Limited sun exposure:** While sunlight contributes to vitamin D production, factors like time spent indoors and skin pigmentation can influence how much vitamin D the body makes.
