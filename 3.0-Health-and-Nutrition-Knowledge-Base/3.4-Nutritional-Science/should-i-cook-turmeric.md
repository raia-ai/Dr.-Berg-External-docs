# Should I cook turmeric?

You would think that heat would destroy all compounds. But, in the case of certain herbal remedies, heat actually seems to enhance certain phytonutrients.

In an interesting study, they tested roasting, boiling, and cooking turmeric at temperatures of 180 degrees Celcius or 356 degrees Fahrenheit for 70 minutes. They measured the total antioxidant capacity.

They found three very powerful antioxidants not only survived but were enhanced with this heat. This is called thermal degradation. It enhances the concentration and increases the solubility of certain phytonutrients.

**3 powerful phytonutrients in turmeric:**

**1\. Ferculic acid**

• It’s an antioxidant

• It helps protect the skin

• It helps counter sun damage

**2\. 4 vinyl guaiacol:**

• It enhances Nrf2 (decreases cellular stress and increases antioxidant defense mechanism)

**3\. Vanillin**

• It’s an antioxidant

• It’s an anti-inflammatory

• It’s antimicrobial
