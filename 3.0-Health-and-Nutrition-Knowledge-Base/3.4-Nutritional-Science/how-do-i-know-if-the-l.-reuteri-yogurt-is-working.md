# How do I know if the L. reuteri yogurt is working?

Dr. Davis's L. reuteri yogurt can help in many ways. Look for these signs after consuming the yogurt regularly for at least 3 weeks:

- Strengthened immune system

- Enhanced muscle tone and healing

- Improved digestion and gut motility

- Improved hair condition

- Increase libido

The L. reuteri must colonize in the gut for these signs to appear. It is recommended to perform a stool sample to test for bacterial strains before starting the L. reuteri yogurt and again 6 weeks after you have started. The count of L. reuteri in the stoll should increase dramatically. If you have already begun with the L. reuteri yogurt, you can take a stool sample test to determine the amount of L. reuteri in your stool, which will help determine if they are colonizing in your gut.
A low level of L. reuteri in a stool sample is generally considered below 1,000 colony-forming units (CFU) per gram of stool. There is no specific “optimal” level of Lactobacillus reuteri in stool samples established in the current research. Low levels may indicate insufficient colonization, possibly due to poor diet, stress, or lack of supplementation or improper yogurt preparation.
