# What are the health benefits and physiological roles of Vitamin B2 (riboflavin), and how does it support overall bodily functions?

Vitamin B2 is called riboflavin. A keto rash is caused by a vitamin B2 deficiency. B2 is involved in fat metabolism, and the more fat that you eat, the more B2 you are going to need.

If you start the ketogenic diet with a vitamin B2 deficiency or even a subclinical vitamin B2 deficiency, the problems related to the deficiency will be magnified.
