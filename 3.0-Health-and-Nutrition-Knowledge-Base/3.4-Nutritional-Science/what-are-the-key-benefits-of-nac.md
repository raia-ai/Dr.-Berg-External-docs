# What are the key benefits of NAC?

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a modified form of the amino acid cysteine, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing protein structures within the body. 

We don't have a specific brand recommendation or dosage for NAC from Dr. Berg, but we do have information about NAC and best practices for buying it. 

Key Benefits of NAC: 

NAC offers a wide range of potential health benefits, including: 

- Liver Support: It can help mitigate liver damage caused by substances like alcohol and acetaminophen (Tylenol), and is even used in emergency settings for overdose. 

- Respiratory Health: NAC is known for its ability to reduce excessive mucus, fluid, and inflammation in the lungs, which can be beneficial for managing conditions like COPD. 

- Neurological and Mental Health: NAC may help normalize neurotransmitters, potentially assisting with symptoms related to autism, addiction (including food, drug, and alcohol addiction), depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. It may also help limit the toxicity associated with certain ADHD medications. 

- Skin Health: Some evidence suggests NAC can help reduce acne and acne scars. 

- Antioxidant Support: A significant function of NAC is its ability to boost the production of glutathione, a powerful antioxidant.
