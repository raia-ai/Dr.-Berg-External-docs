# Can you eat as much as you want on keto?

A keto diet does not necessarily say how large you should make the meals you consume. It is recommended, though, that you consume enough to feel satisfied.

If you eat too much and snack often, even using keto-friendly ingredients, you will slow down your weight loss, as your insulin will be high. For the best results, it’s recommended that you follow the Healthy Keto® diet with an intermittent fasting plan.
