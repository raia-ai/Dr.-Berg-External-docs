# Keto Low Carb Blueberry Mini Bites

If you're on a low-carb diet weight loss journey, this is a fantastic keto-friendly low-carb recipe for muffin bites that you can have as a healthy treat when you really need one.

Right now, there is a craze called mug cakes. It's a really cool concept that you have a small number of ingredients that you mix in mug and pop in the microwave to have as a single serving cake. This is a cool theory, but it relies on a microwave, which we don't feel good about using. 

These recipes turn out way better in the oven over the microwave anyway. We also realized that having a mug full of cake was just too much. So, we made these muffin bites that are perfectly proportioned, they don't have regular sugar or flour, and they're delicious! 

Have these delicious muffin bites with a meal.  Low Carb Blueberry Muffin Bites

3 tbl frozen blueberries

**Directions:**

Grease a mini muffin pan or use cups.

Mix all dry ingredients. Separately, mix all wet ingredients.

Blend wet into dry and mix well with wooden spoon until most lumps are gone.

Gently remove from pan and cool on rack. Enjoy!
