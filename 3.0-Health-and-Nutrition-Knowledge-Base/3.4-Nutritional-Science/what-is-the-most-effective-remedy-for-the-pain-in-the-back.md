# What is the most effective remedy for the pain in the back?

Sciatica is pain down the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve comes from the lumbar spine all the way down the back part of the leg and into the foot. It’s the longest and biggest nerve in the body. The sciatic nerve needs certain nutrients to function correctly. But, the deficiency that will create the most damage to the sciatic nerve is a vitamin B2 deficiency (riboflavin). But, B12 and B1 are also important. Taking the whole B complex may be the best way to go. Benfotiamine may also be beneficial. Benfotiamine is fat-soluble B1.

A vitamin B2 deficiency can be caused by not consuming enough foods that are high in vitamin B2. But, it can also be caused by a problem with the gut that destroys your ability to absorb nutrients. In this situation, you may just need more than the average amount of B2.

**Foods high in vitamin B2:**

• Liver

• Beef

• Clams (and other shellfish)

• Mushrooms

•Nuts

• Cheese

• Eggs

• Fish

• Green vegetables
