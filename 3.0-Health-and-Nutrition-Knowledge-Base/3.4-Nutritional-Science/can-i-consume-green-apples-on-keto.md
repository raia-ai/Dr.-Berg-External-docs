# Can I consume green apples on keto?

No. If you look up the nutritional profile of an apple, this is what you’ll find:

- Saturated fats – .1 g

- Cholesterol – 0 g

- Carbohydrates – 25 g

- Fiber – 44 g

- Sugar – 19 g

Apples have enough sugar to stop fat burning for at least one to two days. At least until you’re at your ideal weight, consuming apples (or any fruit) is probably not a good idea.

What should you snack on? You actually shouldn’t snack at all. Any time you eat, especially sugar, you spike insulin. In the presence of insulin, you can’t burn fat. It’s good to keep insulin very low. If you can’t go without snacking, you need to increase the amount of fat you consume in your meal. Fat helps keep you satisfied and helps keep insulin low.
