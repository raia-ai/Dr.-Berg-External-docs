# What is the difference between the Daily Immunity Kit and the Immune Booster Kit?

The key difference lies in the overall formulations and intended use. The Daily Immunity Kit is designed for year-round, daily immune support with Friendly Bacteria Probiotic, Trace Minerals, and Vitamin D3 & K2. The Immune Booster Kit, with Chewable Vitamin C, Vitamin D3 & K2, and Trace Minerals, is formulated for a more targeted boost when your immune system needs extra support, like during cold and flu season or when you feel run down.
