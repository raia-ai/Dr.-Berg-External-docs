# Is Yacon syrup keto-friendly and safe to consume?

It is definitely not keto-friendly! Though certain people will say that you can have it on keto and that it will help you lose weight, they are way off with this one. Yacon syrup is extracted from the roots of the yacon plant in Peru.

50% of yacon is made up of FOS, or fructooligosaccharide, which is a prebiotic fiber. If you use yacon and you have any problem with candida, SIBO, leaky gut, or any gut inflammation, youâ€™re going to feel bloated.

30% of yacon is fructose sugar. Fructose can overwhelm the liver and lead to insulin resistance and a fatty liver. There was a study that showed that yacon could help you lose weight. However, this was based on a low-fat / low-calorie diet, which is not best for your health. Overall, yacon will spike your blood sugars enough to throw your body out of ketosis and stop fat burning. There are better sweetener alternatives, like allulose, monkfruit, swerve, stevia. Try those instead.
