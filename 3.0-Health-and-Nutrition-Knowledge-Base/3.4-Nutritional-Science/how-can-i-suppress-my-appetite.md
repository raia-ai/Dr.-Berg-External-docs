# How can I suppress my appetite?

To suppress appetite effectively, consider incorporating cinnamon tea and bitter lemon, both of which can help regulate appetite. Berberine supplements may also be beneficial due to their impact on blood sugar levels. Ensure your diet is nutrient-dense and increase your intake of healthy fats, which can aid in appetite control.
