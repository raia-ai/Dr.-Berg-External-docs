# What factors might explain why you feel worse after consuming meat?

**There are several reasons why it can happen. Let’s take a look at two:**

1\. You may not have enough hydrochloric acid in your stomach to digest the protein. This is a common problem and it’s easy to fix. All you need to do is to take some betaine hydrochloride and apple cider vinegar before your meal. This will help increase your stomach’s acidity so you can properly digest red meat. Many people have this problem as they get older.

2\. If you feel bad after eating red meat, it could stem from too much iron. While iron is essential for a healthy body, too much can be a problem. The thing is, our bodies don’t have
a natural mechanism to get rid of iron. If you are not on keto and consume grains, this can increase iron in the body drastically. If you have too much iron you can develop problems that include liver issues, headaches, joint pain, fatigue and insomnia.
