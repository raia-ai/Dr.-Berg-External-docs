# What are the most effective and scientifically supported strategies for addressing and mitigating Candida overgrowth in the body?

A good portion of the microbes in your gut are fungi, and candida is one type of fungi. Friendly fungi support the body in many different ways. It’s not until we change the environment that our friendly bacteria and fungi live in that they can become a problem. For example, one of the biggest side effects of antibiotics is candida overgrowth.

If the ratio of candida to bacteria is incorrect, this can lead to health issues. But bacteria release certain things to help keep candida in check. If candida does turn unfriendly, you need to know what you can do. One important thing to remember to support a healthy microbiome is to take probiotics if you have to take antibiotics.

**The best candida home remedies:**

1\. Take a probiotic and consume probiotic foods

2\. Avoid sugar and dairy

3\. Avoid carbs (do Healthy Keto®)

4\. Avoid sugar alcohols

5\. Consume capric acid (coconut oil or MCT oil)

6\. Consume vegetable fiber

7\. Consume natural herbal antibiotics (garlic, oregano oil, thyme, sage, or turmeric)
