# What is a trace mineral, and how does it differ from other essential minerals in terms of function and required quantities in the body?

**What is a trace mineral?** A trace mineral is a mineral that’s needed in very tiny (or trace) amounts. Trace minerals are helper nutrients in enzymes and proteins.

Important trace minerals for hair:

**1\. Iron**

If you’re anemic and you’re deficient in iron, one symptom can be hair loss.

**2\. Silicon**

Silicon helps with the structure of your hair.

**3\. Zinc**

If you’re deficient in zinc, you could develop male pattern baldness.

**4\. Copper**

Copper is involved with the color of your hair and building collagen.

**5\. Selenium**

This is one of the most powerful antioxidants.
