# What is the best tactic if I want to wake up refreshed?

The most important factor in quality sleep and waking up feeling refreshed is the sleep hormone called melatonin. Melatonin is triggered when you aren’t exposed to light. When it’s dark at night, and less light is shining into your eye, it activates the pineal gland, which then turns serotonin into melatonin. This makes you tired.

Any light source can potentially turn off the pineal gland and melatonin production. Melatonin is also vitally important for your immune system. Melatonin has numerous other functions as well. It’s used as an antioxidant, which helps prevent free-radicle damage. The problem with taking melatonin supplements is that your body then makes less of it. It’s not a fix to your problems. As you age, your melatonin decreases. This can cause poor sleep and immune function as you get older. It can also cause inflammation in the body.

**This is how you can enhance melatonin production before bed:**

1\. Lights out before bed

2\. Water filter for removing fluoride

3\. Glycine

4\. Reduce blue light exposure

5\. Get sun and vitamin D during the day

6\. Lower stress, caffeine, and alcohol

7\. Keep your bedroom cool

8\. Avoid EMFs
