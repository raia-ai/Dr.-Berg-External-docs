# What are the key benefits of UV radiation, and how does it aid vitamin D synthesis, skin health, and therapeutic uses?

Many people think they need to avoid ultraviolet radiation—their first thought may even be that it causes cancer. Today we're going to talk about the potent anti-inflammatory effects of UV radiation and its other benefits. UV radiation is a part of the spectrum of energy from the sun. Humans have adapted over time to survive the sun's radiation and use it to our advantage.

Ultraviolet radiation is the only part of the sun's energy that helps the body make vitamin D, which is essential. Vitamin D is one of the most important vitamins for your immune system and is an incredibly potent anti-inflammatory. While chronic exposure to UV radiation is unhealthy and can increase your risk of certain skin cancers, it may have significant health benefits in small doses.

Too much exposure to ultraviolet radiation can also cause wrinkles, loss of collagen, and aging spots. But having enough antioxidants in your skin may help protect you from these issues. If you build up the antioxidants in your skin—in small doses, the benefits of ultraviolet radiation may outweigh the negatives.
