# What are the potential causes of high blood potassium levels?

**Hyperkalemia Overview:**

**Definition:** Excess potassium in the body, rare but serious.

**Symptoms (severe cases):**

\- Palpitations

\- Tiredness

\- Numbness

\- Abnormal heart rate

\- Shortness of breath

\- Muscle pain/weakness

**Causes and Remedies:**

1\. **Addisonâ€™s Disease:**

\- **Cause:** Autoimmune adrenal gland condition, leading to salt loss.

\- **Remedies:** Avoid potassium-rich foods, use sea salt, supplement with vitamin B1, manage stress, consider Panax ginseng.

2\. **Advanced Kidney Disease:**

\- **Cause:** Reduced kidney function impairs potassium removal.

\- **Remedies:** Limit potassium-rich vegetables, use sea salt, monitor potassium intake, consider astragalus and citrates.

**Other Causes:**

\- Medications like NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, potassium-sparing diuretics.

These steps help maintain potassium balance and support kidney and adrenal health effectively.
