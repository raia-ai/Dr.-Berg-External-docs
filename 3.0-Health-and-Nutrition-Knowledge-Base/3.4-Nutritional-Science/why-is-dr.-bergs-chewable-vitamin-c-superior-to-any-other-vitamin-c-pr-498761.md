# Why is Dr. Berg's Chewable Vitamin C superior to any other Vitamin C products on the market?

Think about most vitamin C supplements – they're essentially just ascorbic acid. Now, calling isolated ascorbic acid "Vitamin C" is debatable because, in nature, Vitamin C is always part of a complex. This natural complex contains ascorbic acid (the antioxidant part) along with bioflavonoids, Vitamin J, trace minerals, and other natural cofactors.

Our approach is to provide Vitamin C from a food base. Instead of the synthetic ascorbic acid often made chemically from cornstarch and sulfuric acid (yes, really, and often from China), we concentrate actual berries rich in natural Vitamin C. This way, you're getting Vitamin C in the form your body is designed by nature to receive it.

Why is cheap, synthetic ascorbic acid so common? It comes down to economics. It's incredibly cheap to manufacture, leading to immense profit margins – potentially 7000% or more. Producing natural, food-based Vitamin C is much more costly, which means significantly less profit, explaining its relative rarity in the market.
