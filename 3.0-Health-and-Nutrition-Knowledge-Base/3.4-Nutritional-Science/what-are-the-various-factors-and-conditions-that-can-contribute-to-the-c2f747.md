# What are the various factors and conditions that can contribute to the development of colon polyps?

Colon polyps are abnormal tissue growths in your colon. Certain polyps have a high risk of colon cancer.

**Cause #1: Lack of friendly bacteria in the gut**

Colon polyps are caused by a lack of friendly bacteria in your gut. In particular, itâ€™s a deficiency in lactobacillus. Lactobacillus helps lower your colon inflammation, tightens your colon wall, inhibits pathogens, reduces oxidation, and decreases the chance of cell mutation and cancer. This bacteria is commonly found in fermented and pickled vegetables.
