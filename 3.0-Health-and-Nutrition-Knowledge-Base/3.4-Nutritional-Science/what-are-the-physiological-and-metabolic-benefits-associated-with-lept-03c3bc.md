# What are the physiological and metabolic benefits associated with leptin, and how does this hormone influence body weight regulation and energy balance?

Leptin is a hormone produced by fat cells. It sends signals through the blood to tell the body that you’re full. So leptin is a satiety hormone—it lets your brain know that it’s time to stop eating. If you have a hard time feeling full or satisfied, it could be that your leptin levels are too low.

Additionally, since your fat cells make leptin, the more body fat you have, the higher the levels of leptin that you should have. In theory, it would mean that the fatter you are, the more satisfied you should be. However, this is not the case. When you have an excessive amount of leptin, your leptin receptors begin to develop a resistance to it. This is very similar to insulin resistance. Those who are obese have a lot of leptin, but it is unavailable to their body. In turn, this condition brings a lot of hunger all day long.

The only way to restore leptin sensitivity is to lose weight so you can maintain a healthy leptin level.
