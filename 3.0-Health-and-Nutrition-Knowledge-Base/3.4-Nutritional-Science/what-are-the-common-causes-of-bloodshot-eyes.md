# What are the common causes of bloodshot eyes?

Interestingly, vitamin B2 deficiency can cause your eyes to look bloodshot.

Low vitamin B2 can cause other symptoms related to your eyes, including itchy eyes, watery eyes, and light sensitivity.

**Aside from your eyes, a vitamin B2 deficiency may also cause symptoms such as:**

• Cracked or chapped lips

• Cracked corners of your mouth

• Oily nose

• Red tongue

• Migraines

The question is, what causes low vitamin B2? A vitamin B2 deficiency isn’t usually caused by not consuming enough foods with vitamin B2. Instead, it’s typically caused by a malabsorption situation.

There are two primary causes of poor vitamin B2 absorption. Inflammation in the digestive system can cause absorption issues, and refined carbohydrates can cause poor absorption. Bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, pancakes, waffles, biscuits, and all other refined carbohydrate products are very destructive to your digestive system. Avoid these at all costs.
