# This Is CRAZY!

Homesteader John Moody is raising the alarm about a bill that could drastically change how livestock is tracked in America. He explains that while livestock identification has evolved over time – from branding to ear tags – a new threat is on the horizon: electronic identification (EID) using RFID technology.

Moody believes this push for EID, under the guise of safety, is actually part of a larger agenda to reduce meat consumption in the US and other Western countries. He argues that after failing to persuade people to eat less meat, authorities are now resorting to controlling the supply side by making it harder and more expensive for farmers to raise livestock.

This isn't the first time this issue has surfaced. In the early 2000s, the USDA attempted to introduce the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), which would have mandated RFID tagging for all livestock – except those in large-scale confinement operations (CAFOs). Moody emphasizes that the USDA has the authority to enact such rules without needing Congressional approval.

However, there is hope. Congresswoman Harriet Hageman, who has successfully blocked similar RFID mandates twice before, has introduced a bill to stop NAIS. Moody urges everyone, not just farmers, to get involved. He points out that a century ago, half of American households were involved in farming, compared to just 2-3 million farmers today. Supporting local farmers and buying food directly from them is crucial, but so is taking political action.

Moody calls on everyone to contact their Congressperson and Senator, urging them to support Hageman's amendment to prevent mandatory RFID tagging of livestock. He also highlights the Rogue Food Conference organized by Joel Salatin, which aims to fight regulations that hinder access to locally-sourced food. The next conference will be held on November 8th and 9th in Dallas.

This is a call to action to protect our food supply and support our farmers. By raising awareness and taking action, we can help ensure access to healthy, locally-sourced food for generations to come.
