# What strategies can I employ to manage gastroparesis effectively?

Gastroparesis, often associated with diabetes, is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system. To manage this condition, consider incorporating alpha-lipoic acid, which can help mitigate complications related to diabetes, and benfotiamine, a B1 vitamin known for its neurological benefits. Additionally, allithiamine, a fat-soluble form of natural B1, may provide further support for central nervous system function.
