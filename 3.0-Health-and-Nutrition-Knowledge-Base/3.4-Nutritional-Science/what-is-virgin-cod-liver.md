# What is Virgin Cod Liver?

The term 'Virgin Cod Liver Oil' means the oil is extracted without heat, chemicals, or fermentation, ensuring its nutrients remain intact. Our Cod Liver Oil starts as virgin, and we then use a drying process with acacia gum to create a powder. This process prevents rancidity, extends shelf life, and makes the oil easier to consume.
