# Is fever beneficial to the body?

Fever is a natural defense mechanism that helps the body fight infections by mobilizing white blood cells and speeding up recovery. Attempting to reduce a fever immediately can prolong the illness. Natural approaches to support the body during fever include taking appropriate nutrients like calcium lactate and trace minerals, and occasionally fasting. It's important to monitor fever levels and seek medical advice if they exceed specific thresholds based on age. Additionally, factors like body temperature variations, dietary influences, sleep conditions, and smoking can affect overall body temperature regulation.
