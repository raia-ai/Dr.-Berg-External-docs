# How to stop frequent night time urination?

Frequent urination is often blamed on an enlarged prostate, UTIs, or kidney stones, but there’s a much more common root cause.

The most common cause of frequent urination at night is too much insulin in your blood. Insulin resistance is a condition where your insulin receptors no longer accept insulin. To compensate, the pancreas produces more insulin. This is why many diabetics have a problem with urinary frequency at night.

When blood sugar is high, the kidneys remove the sugar from the blood to eliminate it from the body. This increases urination frequency. Insulin resistance causes an overactive bladder, even if your blood sugar is normal. Increased urinary frequency at night is an early sign of insulin resistance, which is a precursor to diabetes. Insulin resistance increases stress on the kidneys, which is why diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease. Insulin resistance can also cause electrolyte imbalances, blood pressure changes at night, and increased cortisol.

Snacking at night is the single most significant cause of frequent urination at night. Eliminate all snacks and beverages after dinner to decrease urination frequency at night. Snacking at night can also cause bloating and interrupted sleep.

A low-salt diet can also increase urination frequency at night. If you think your nocturia is due to low salt, add more sea salt to your meals throughout the day.

A low-carb diet can help reduce nocturia symptoms. Keep your carb consumption under 30 grams per day. Healthy Keto® can combat insulin resistance, improve your health, and reduce frequent urination at night.

Intermittent fasting is equally important in reversing insulin resistance. Aim for 3 meals with no snacks, eventually dropping down to 2 meals each day. Ending nocturia will significantly enhance your sleep, which is vital for your heart, blood sugar, stress levels, energy, cognitive function, and more. Don’t forget to get plenty of vitamin D with magnesium.
