# Has the consumption of high-fructose syrup in the US increased?

High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) consumption has skyrocketed since the 1970s, outpacing the increase of any other food ingredient. This potent sweetener negatively impacts your health, contributing to metabolic problems, fatty liver disease, and inflammation.

HFCS lurks in many foods and drinks. It's often made from GMO corn, adding to health concerns. While other food trends have shifted, HFCS use continues its relentless rise.

The U.S., the world's top corn producer, has seen dramatic increases in corn yield per acre due to GMOs and chemicals. This has significant consequences for our environment and the food we eat.

Stay vigilant! Avoid HFCS and its aliases: modified food starch, modified corn starch, maltodextrin, glucose syrup, and seed oils.
