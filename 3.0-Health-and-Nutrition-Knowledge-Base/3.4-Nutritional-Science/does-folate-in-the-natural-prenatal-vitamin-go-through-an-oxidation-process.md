# Does folate in the Natural Prenatal Vitamin go through an oxidation process?

No, the body doesn’t turn natural folate from whole foods into folic acid through oxidation. In fact, it’s the other way around. Folic acid is the synthetic, fully oxidized version of vitamin B9, and the body has to convert it into its active form before it can be used.
