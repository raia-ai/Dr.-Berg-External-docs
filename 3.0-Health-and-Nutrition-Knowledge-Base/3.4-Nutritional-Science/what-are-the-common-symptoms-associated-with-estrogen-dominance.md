**Cause #1: Consuming foods high in estrogen**

Consuming foods with high amounts of estrogen can cause estrogen dominance. The solution would be to consume foods that are natural estrogen blockers like cruciferous vegetables, while avoiding foods that have high amounts of this hormone.

**Cause #2: High percentage of body fat**

If you have a high percentage of body fat this can cause estrogen dominance. This is because your body fat produces estrogen itself. The less body fat you have the less estrogen will be produced by your own body.
