# What are the two reasons why people can't stick to their diet plan?

The biggest reasons people can’t stick to a diet are #1 hunger and #2 cravings. 

There are two main hormones involved in hunger and cravings:

1\. Ghrelin — This hormone makes you hungry, so we want to decrease it. 

2\. Leptin — This hormone makes you feel satisfied, so we want to increase it.
