# Can I consume flaxseed oil on keto?

Not really. It is a highly refined product and is not recommended on keto.

Although flax seeds are loaded with omega-3, ligands, fiber, B1, etc. the problem is that flax has enzymes and enzyme inhibitors that prevent the absorption of nutrients. If you consume sprouted flax, you will absorb nutrients much better.
