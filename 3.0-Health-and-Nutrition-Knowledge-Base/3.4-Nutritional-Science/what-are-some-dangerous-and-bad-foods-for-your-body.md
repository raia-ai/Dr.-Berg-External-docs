# What are some dangerous and bad foods for your body?

**The top deadliest foods:**

1\. Pufferfish (fugu)

2\. Death cap mushroom

3\. Korean baby octopus

4\. Green potatoes

5\. Raw chicken

6\. Foods containing cyanide:

• The seeds or pits of apples, peaches, pears, and apricots

• Bitter almonds

• Cassava

It’s best to avoid any of the above at all costs. If you do somehow consume death cap mushrooms, milk thistle and NAC are two potential antidotes that may help. Methylene blue is another potential antidote that has been used to help counter cyanide poisoning.
