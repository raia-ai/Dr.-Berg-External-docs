# What is the relationship between glycogen stores and electrolytes when doing Keto and Intermittent fasting?

**Glycogen is series of glucose molecules linked together as a group. When you have more glycogen, you are going to hold more water. Doing ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting will shrink down glycogen that could cause the symptoms in transitioning from sugar burning to fat burning.**

**Problems of Deplete Minerals:**

• Sodium – Weaker muscles, keto flu, dizziness, low blood pressure

• Potassium – Fatigue, Sleep problems, higher pulse rate. Potassium is needed for energy and also calmness when sleeping.

• Calcium – Cramps

• Magnesium – Sleep problem, cramps, heart rhythm
