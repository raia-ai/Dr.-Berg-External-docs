# How do I prevent my blood sugar levels from crashing in the afternoon?

To prevent blood sugar crashes later in the day, can take a few steps. The first is to add more fats to your meals. Making sure you are consuming adequate levels of protein can also help. Eating plenty of greens while avoiding carbs is very important if you want to prevent a crash. And finally, make sure to eliminate snacking from your dietary routine, as this causes regular insulin spikes and blood sugar crashes.
