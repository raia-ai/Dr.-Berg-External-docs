# Why are there no fat people in Colorado? Connection with Vitamin D

**Why are there no fat people in Colorado?**

Areas of the US with higher Black, Latino, and American Indian populations have higher obesity rates. The elderly have higher rates of obesity as well. People with darker skin tones have more melanin, making it more difficult to absorb vitamin D. It also becomes more difficult to absorb vitamin D as you age.

**Chronic vitamin D deficiency can lead to obesity.**

The more overweight a person is, the more vitamin D they need. The characteristics of metabolic syndrome align perfectly with the symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency can create inflammation, high blood glucose, high blood pressure, and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the driving factor behind obesity. If you have insulin resistance, you have too much insulin. Insulin is a fat-storing hormone that causes you to gain weight. Vitamin D helps keep insulin sensitive, but vitamin D doesn’t work well if you have insulin resistance.

**Colorado is a high-altitude state situated several thousand feet above sea level.**

This means it’s closer to the sun. The closer you are to the sun, the more vitamin D you’re exposed to. Vitamin D exposure in Colorado could be the most critical variable influencing people's weight.
