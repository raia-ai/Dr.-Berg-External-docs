# Is Silicon Dioxide safe?

Silicon dioxide, also known as silica, is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in food supplements. However, long-term inhalation of silicon dioxide dust into the respiratory system may negatively impact health.

Silicon dioxide is used in supplements to prevent powdered ingredients from sticking together.

Silicon dioxide comprises two of Earth's most abundant materials: silicon and oxygen. Silicon should not be confused with silicone. Silicone is a man-made liquid or a flexible, rubberlike plastic material that is unsafe for consumption. Silicon dioxide is found naturally in the tissues of the human body and in many plants, such as:

- leafy green vegetables

- beets

- bell peppers

- alfalfa

The Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM) allocated a safe upper level of 25 mg/kg body weight per day (equivalent to 1,500 mg/day for a 60‚Äêkg/132-pound adult).
