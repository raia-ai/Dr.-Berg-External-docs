# What causes palpitations after eating?

Palpitations, irregular heartbeats such as skipped or extra beats, can stem from various causes related to cardiac function:

1\. **Digestive Issues (Gallbladder Problems)**: Address with intermittent fasting and avoiding refined carbs and vegetable oils, opting for a healthy keto diet.

2\. **Alkalinity**: Manage through healthy keto practices and incorporating apple cider vinegar to balance pH levels.

3\. **Low Potassium**: Causes include diuretics, diarrhea, antacids, and insufficient dietary intake of potassium-rich foods (7-10 cups of vegetables daily).

Managing these factors can help alleviate palpitations and promote heart health.
