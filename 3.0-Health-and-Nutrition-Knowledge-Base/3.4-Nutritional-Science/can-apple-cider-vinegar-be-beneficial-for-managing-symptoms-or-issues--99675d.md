# Can apple cider vinegar be beneficial for managing symptoms or issues associated with menopause?

Apple cider vinegar may offer some benefits, but its effects are relatively modest. During menopause, increased cortisol levels can lead to the mobilization of proteins and the conversion of these proteins into sugar, potentially contributing to atrophy and other issues. To address these challenges, it's essential to support the adrenal glands alongside maintaining a balanced diet. The adrenal glands take over hormone production once the ovaries cease functioning, so managing stress and supporting adrenal health are crucial for overall well-being during menopause.
