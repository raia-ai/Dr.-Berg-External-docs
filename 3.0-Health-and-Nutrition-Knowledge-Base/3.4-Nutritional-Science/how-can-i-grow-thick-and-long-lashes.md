# How can I grow thick and long lashes?

To promote the growth of long, thick eyelashes, addressing deficiencies in trace minerals is crucial for supporting protein synthesis. Specifically, zinc plays a key role in the production of prostaglandins essential for eyelash growth. Ricinoleic acid found in organic, cold-processed castor oil can also help correct deficiencies and stimulate eyelash regrowth.

Incorporating these elements, either through dietary sources or supplements, can effectively support healthier eyelash growth and density.
