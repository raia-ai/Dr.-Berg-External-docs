# How does prolonged high blood sugar impact nerve health?

Suffering from sustained high blood sugar can cause damage to your motor or sensory nerves. The condition is called peripheral neuropathy. You can also have problems with the autonomic nerves and even the nerves to the eye. High blood sugar can also affect the blood vessels that innervate your nerves.

Taking more B-vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast supports the myelin sheath around the nerves. In addition, switching to a low carb diet like Healthy KetoÂ® can be helpful in negating the side-effects of high blood sugar on the nerves.
