# How does niacin help with xantomas?

Niacin can help with xanthomas by addressing underlying cholesterol issues. Here are the key points:

- **Cholesterol Management**: Niacin is one of the most effective nutrients for raising HDL (good) cholesterol levels and lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol. This can help reduce the cholesterol buildup that leads to xanthomas.

- **Liver Health**: Niacin has been shown to reduce inflammation and prevent fat buildup in the liver, which can contribute to better overall cholesterol management.

- **Dosage Recommendation**: To help lower cholesterol levels effectively, 500 milligrams of extended-release niacin two to three times daily may help.

Always consult with your medical healthcare provider before starting any new supplement or protocol to address a medical condition.
