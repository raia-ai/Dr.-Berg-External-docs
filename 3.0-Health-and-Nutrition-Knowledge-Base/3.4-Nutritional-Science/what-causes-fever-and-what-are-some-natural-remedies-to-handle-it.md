# What causes fever and what are some natural remedies to handle it?

Fever is an increased body temperature. It is caused by your immune system as a way to fight internal infections. Letâ€™s look at the common causes of fever and their remedies.

Symptoms

- High temperature

- Sweating

- Chills and shivering

- Headache

- Muscle aches

- Loss of appetite

- Irritability

- Dehydration

- General weakness

**Cause #1: Infection**

If your body is undergoing a viral or bacterial infection, this can trigger your immune system to create fever. Fever is a mechanism that helps your body to fight the harmful infection.

The solution would not be to suppress your fever with medication, but rather to strengthen your immune system and counter the virus with natural antibiotics. Fasting is one of the best ways to boost your immune system, and that will also speed up the process of getting your body back to normal.

**Cause #2: An autoimmune condition**

An autoimmune condition means your immune system is attacking your own healthy body cells. This can create inflammation and a fever as a result. Usually this stems from some kind of immune system confusion prior to that. Thus, strengthening your immune system as well as lowering the inflammation should help.

**Cause #3: Inflammatory condition**

If you have inflammation in some area of your body that is not going away, this in itself can cause a higher body temperature. Consuming foods that are inflammatory can cause this condition as well. The solution would be to reduce the inflammation.
