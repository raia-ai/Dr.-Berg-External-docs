# Is gallbladder olive oil flush effective?

A gallbladder flush with olive oil is intended to remove gallstones but typically only expels bile salts. Ironically, reducing bile can increase the risk of gallstones. Gallstones form when there is a high concentration of cholesterol and low bile levels. Bile is crucial for absorbing fat-soluble vitamins and fatty acids. A high-carb diet reduces bile release, while a high-fat diet does not cause gallstones if sufficient bile is produced. Fat triggers bile release, preventing stone formation, not causing it.
