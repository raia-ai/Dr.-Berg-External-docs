**Navigating Potential Side Effects of DHT Blockers**

While reducing DHT can help prevent hair loss, excessive blocking may lead to side effects. For instance, finasteride can cause decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, mood changes, and gynecomastia.

Consult your doctor to weigh the risks and benefits, adjust dosages if needed, and explore alternatives. Persistent side effects, even after discontinuation, may occur. Regular follow-ups with your healthcare provider will ensure a balanced approach to treatment.
