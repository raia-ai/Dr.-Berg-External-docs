# What are effective remedies for alleviating sinus mucus, pressure, and post-nasal drip to improve comfort and reduce symptoms?

**This remedy may be beneficial if you’re experiencing:** 

• Postnasal drip 

• Chronic rhinitis or sinusitis 

• Sinus pressure 

• Sinus headaches or cluster headaches 

• Sinus allergies 

Common treatments for nasal congestion are steroids, medications, or even surgery. But, these options can have side effects or complications.  **One of the best natural remedies for mucus in the sinuses is hot peppers.** You can consume hot peppers or use a nasal spray containing hot pepper.  This is very different from pepper spray—we’re talking about a very diluted solution. 

Instead of suppressing mucus, the phytonutrient in hot peppers may help drain mucus from the sinuses and reduce nasal hyperactivity.  It can potentially help open the sinuses, drain the sinuses, and desensitize the mucus membranes in the sinuses. It’s also antimicrobial.  Try consuming cottage cheese to help neutralize the effects of consuming hot peppers if needed.
