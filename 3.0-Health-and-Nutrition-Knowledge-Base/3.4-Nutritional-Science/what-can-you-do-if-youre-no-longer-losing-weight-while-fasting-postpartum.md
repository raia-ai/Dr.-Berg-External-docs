# What can you do if youâ€™re no longer losing weight while fasting postpartum?

**When you actually go through pregnancy or actually deliver, you have this spike of estrogen that pops up. It interferes with your metabolism. Estrogen does contribute to certain types of fat.**

**I would work on getting into what's called keto adaptation a little bit more to the point where it's easier to do fasting.** That does take weeks, but it's dependent on how many carbs that you eat when you eat. So maybe finding substitutes for those carbs because the problem is that all it takes is a little bit of carbs to knock you out of fat burning for a longer period of time.

**The other thing is adding in twice a week high intensity interval training just to start to stimulate the exercise, but don't do it more than twice a week. But when you do it, like do it really good. In between that, do long walks and then try to get an extra hour of sleep.**

**To make fasting easier, sometimes it's helpful if when you do eat, you just add a little more fat to go longer.** But over time, it's gonna be easier to fast. If you're having any problems fasting for a longer period of time, all that means is that you have to either lower your carbs when you eat or just give it more time and then build up to that.
