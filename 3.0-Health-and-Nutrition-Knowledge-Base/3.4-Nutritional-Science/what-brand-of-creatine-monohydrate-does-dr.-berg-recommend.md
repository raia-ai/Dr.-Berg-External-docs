# What brand of creatine monohydrate does Dr. Berg recommend?

**Creatine Monohydrate: Enhancing Strength and Recovery** 

While Dr. Berg doesn't have a specific brand recommendation for **creatine monohydrate**, it's a popular supplement known for its benefits in strength training and muscle recovery. 

Creatine is naturally formed from three amino acids: **arginine, glycine, and methionine**. Within your muscles, it combines with phosphate to help **recycle ATP**, which is essentially the energy currency your muscles use. This process aids in rapid energy recovery during intense activities. 

**Key Benefits of Creatine:** 

- **Tolerate Heavy Weight Training:** Creatine can help you push through more intense workouts. 

- **Muscle Recovery:** It supports faster recovery of your muscles after exercise. 

- **Muscle Strength:** Regular supplementation can lead to increased muscle strength. 

- **Muscle Size:** It can contribute to gains in muscle size. 

**Types of Creatine and Allergy Considerations:** 

There are different types of creatine available. Two versions often considered superior are: 

- **Creatine Ethyl Ester:** Some believe this form is better absorbed, though research is mixed. 

- **Micronized Creatine:** This is a very common and effective form, known for its fine particle size which can improve solubility and reduce stomach upset. 

It's important to note that some individuals can be **allergic to creatine**. If you're trying it for the first time, it's wise to **start with a small amount** to ensure you don't have an adverse reaction.  

**Best Practices for Buying Creatine Monohydrate:** 

When purchasing creatine, especially creatine monohydrate, hereâ€™s what to look for to ensure you get a high-quality product: 

1. **Third-Party Testing:** Choose brands that utilize **third-party testing**. This means an independent lab verifies the product's purity, potency, and absence of contaminants (like heavy metals or unwanted byproducts). This information is often displayed on the product's label or the manufacturer's website. 

2. **No Fillers or Additives:** Opt for products with minimal ingredients. You primarily want just creatine monohydrate, not a lot of unnecessary fillers, artificial flavors, or sweeteners, unless you prefer a flavored version from a reputable brand. 

3. **Mixability:** Micronized creatine generally mixes well in water or other beverages, reducing grittiness. Check reviews to see if users report good mixability. 

4. **Brand Reputation:** Purchase from well-established and trusted supplement brands with a history of quality control and customer satisfaction.
