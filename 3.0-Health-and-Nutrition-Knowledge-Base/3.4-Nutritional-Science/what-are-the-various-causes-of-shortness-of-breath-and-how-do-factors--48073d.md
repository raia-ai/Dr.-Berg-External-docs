# What are the various causes of shortness of breath, and how do factors such as respiratory conditions, cardiovascular issues, and anxiety contribute to this symptom?

Shortness of breath means you canâ€™t breathe well. Although some underlying disease can cause shortness of breath (dyspnea), diet and lifestyle choices may be at the root of this problem.

**Cause #1: Nutrient deficiencies**

Vitamins and minerals are essential for managing lung function, inflammation, muscle function, and heart activity. If you are deficient in vital nutrients, you can have a difficult time catching your breath. The main vitamin to pay attention to is B1. One of the main effects of a B1 deficiency is that you find you have breathing problems.

**Cause #2: pH imbalances**

A highly acidic body (acidosis) or a highly alkaline body (alkalosis) can cause you to feel out of breath or hungry for air. The solution is simple: normalize your pH (acidity-alkaline) level with the right diet.
