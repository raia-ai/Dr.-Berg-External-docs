# What are the possible reasons for insufficient muscle growth?

Lack of muscle growth can have several underlying reasons; however it has simple and effective remedies.

**Cause #1: Lack of workout intensity**

To be able to have muscle growth you have to do higher weights and lower reps. This is because your muscle tissues need to be damaged from the exercise for your body to heal them and make them bigger. Make sure your technique is correct to avoid injuries and gradually increase the intensity.

**Remedies:**

- Hire a personal trainer to help you with the workouts and technique

- Put enough weights so you can barely do 5 to 7 reps (make sure you gradually increase the weights)

- Do more compound exercises that affect several muscles:

deadlifts

squats

overhead push

power clean

**Cause #2: Lack of recovery**

Your muscles grow when you sleep. This is because after the exercises your body has to heal the damaged muscle tissues and grow them. If you have high-intensity exercises and you eat correctly but don’t recover this can definitely cause inability to gain muscle mass. The best way is to improve your recovery.

Additionally, if you undergo high amounts of stress, this will cause your body to produce too much cortisol (stress-regulating hormone). Cortisol could break down your muscle tissues and turn them into blood sugar.

**Remedies:**

- Sleep 8 to 9 hrs per day (take naps if needed)

- Let your muscles recover fully before training the same muscles again

- Consume potassium (4,700 mg / day)

- Consume more vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast

• benfotiamine

- Avoid things and people that stress you out

- Take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes).

**Cause #3: Low amounts of human growth hormone and testosterone**

There are two main hormones that help us grow and retain muscles. These are testosterone and human growth hormone. If you lack these hormones it can result in muscle loss and inability to grow it.

Human growth hormone (HGH) is an anti-aging hormone. It burns fat as well as building muscles and regenerating the body. The best way to increase HGH is to do intermittent fasting and high-intensity full body training.

Testosterone is a male hormone that is also needed for women in smaller amounts. Having normal amounts of testosterone in addition to exercises can build your muscles. One way to improve testosterone is by avoiding things that cause it to go low.

**Remedies:**

- Increase human growth hormone by doing these things:

    - do intermittent fasting

    - consume 7 to 8 oz of protein per meal

    - improve sleep

- Increase testosterone by doing the following:

    - consume more cholesterol (helps to make testosterone)

    - consume moderate amounts of protein (6 to 8 oz in meal)

    - consume zinc (100 mg / day)

- consume korean red ginseng

- take L-arginine

- take D-aspartic acid

- consume cruciferous vegetables (natural estrogen blockers)

- consume DIM (concentrated cruciferous)

- consume white button mushrooms

- consume mushrooms in general

- consume celery

- consume parsley

- consume olive oil

**Cause #4: Insulin resistance**

Consuming a lot of refined carbs and sugars will spike your insulin high in order to lower the blood sugar level that results. Eventually your cells become resistant to insulin. The connection between insulin resistance and lack of muscle growth requires an understanding of insulin.

Insulin acts like a key to the cells, allowing them to absorb vital nutrients. If your cells are resistant to insulin they don’t absorb protein well, causing slow muscle growth or inability to grow muscle.

If you do the Healthy Keto® diet as well as an intermittent fasting plan your body cells will be less resistant to insulin--allowing them to absorb more protein and therefore grow more muscle mass.

**Other causes:**

- Avoid snacking (spikes insulin)

- Avoid refined carbs and sugar

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do intermittent fasting

- Keep your carbs under 50 g/day

- Consume moderate amounts of protein (6 to 8 oz per meal)
