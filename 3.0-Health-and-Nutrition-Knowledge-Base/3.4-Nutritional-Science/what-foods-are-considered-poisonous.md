# What foods are considered poisonous?

**Beware of these seemingly healthy foods:**

1. **Granola Bars:** Nature Valley granola bars contain GMO ingredients, which are linked to the herbicide glyphosate, a potential carcinogen. They also contain high amounts of sugar, unhealthy seed oils, and refined starches.

2. **Agave Syrup:** Though often marketed as a healthier sweetener, agave syrup is actually 85% fructose. Fructose is processed by the liver like a toxin, and its excessive consumption can lead to health problems.

3. **Flavored Yogurt:** Despite being promoted as healthy, flavored yogurts are often loaded with sugar - sometimes even more than a candy bar! Many of the probiotics in them also won't survive stomach acid. Opt for whole-fat, Bulgarian, Greek yogurt, or kefir without added sugar instead.

4. **Non-Dairy Creamers:** While seemingly a healthy swap for milk, non-dairy creamers often contain unhealthy ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, glucose syrup, maltodextrin, and trans fats. Stick to regular cream or half-and-half, or choose non-dairy options without these ingredients.

5. **Soy Milk:** Soy products like soy milk can have estrogenic effects, which may lead to unwanted hormonal imbalances. Soy milk is also a highly processed food, unlike actual milk.

6. **Fast-Food Lettuce:** Salads may seem healthy, but fast-food lettuce is often coated in preservatives and washed in chlorine. Dressings are also usually packed with unhealthy ingredients.

7. **Puffed Cereals/Rice Cakes:** These highly processed foods offer little nutritional value. One chemist even observed rats dying after being fed puffed cereal!

**Remember:** It's always important to read the ingredients list carefully and choose whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible.
