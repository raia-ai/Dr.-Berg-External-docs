# What's the most workable remedy to drain sinuses?

Keep in mind that a high-carb diet can feed the microbes that cause sinus problems. Natural remedies can help provide relief, but unless you change your diet, your sinus problems could come back.

**The top natural remedies to drain your sinuses:**

1\. Spanish black radish

• You can consume these throughout the day or take them as a supplement. If you take them as a supplement, you can take three every hour for eight hours.

2\. Black seed oil

• Take this on a regular basis. Consider tripling the regular dosage.

3\. Kimchi juice

• Put a tiny amount of the juice on your finger and apply it to the inside of the nostrils, no more than 1/4 inch deep.

4\. Do a nasal rinse with saline solution and colloidal silver

• Get a nasal rinse kit and pour out some of the saline solution. Mix 1/4 teaspoon of colloidal silver into 1/2 cup water and add the mixture to the saline solution.
