# How can potassium deficiency be addressed and prevented?

To address and prevent potassium deficiency while following a keto-friendly approach, focus on incorporating low-carb, potassium-rich foods into your diet.

Include keto-friendly sources of potassium such as avocados, leafy green vegetables (like spinach and kale), nuts (such as almonds and walnuts), and seeds (like chia seeds). If needed, consult with a healthcare professional to tailor your keto diet to address specific potassium requirements.
