# PFAS, or per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances

PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of man-made chemicals that have earned the nickname "forever chemicals" due to their extreme persistence in the environment and our bodies. They've been linked to a range of serious health issues, including:  

- **Cancer**

- **Hormone disruption**

- **Liver damage**

- **Reproductive problems**

**Where are PFAS found?**

These chemicals are surprisingly pervasive, found in:

- **Everyday products:** Teflon cookware, food packaging, canned goods, stain-resistant fabrics, firefighting foam

- **Our environment:** Drinking water, soil, air

- **Our bodies:** Fat cells, breast milk

**How to Minimize Your Exposure and Support Detoxification**

While it's impossible to completely avoid PFAS, you can take steps to limit your exposure and support your body's natural detoxification processes:

**1\. Reduce your exposure:**

- **Filter your drinking water:** Invest in a high-quality water filter certified to remove PFAS, such as those from Travel Berkey, Clearly Filtered, or Zero Water.

- **Choose PFAS-free products:** Opt for cookware, food packaging, and other products that are PFAS-free.

- **Minimize processed foods:** Processed foods often contain higher levels of PFAS.

**2\. Support your body's detoxification:**

- **Boost your glutathione levels:** This crucial antioxidant helps neutralize toxins.

    - Consume foods rich in sulfur: Eggs, garlic, onions, cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts).

    - Increase your intake of glutamine: Found in red meat, glycine, and probiotics.

- **Enhance elimination:**

    - **Sweat regularly:** Through exercise or sauna use.

    - **Support autophagy:** Intermittent fasting can help promote this cellular cleaning process.

    - **Consider infrared light therapy:** May aid in detoxification.

    - **Consume spirulina and chlorella:** These algae are known for their detoxifying properties.

**3\. Support your overall health:**

- **Eat a nutrient-rich diet:** Focus on whole, unprocessed foods, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein.

- **Ensure adequate intake of trace minerals:** Selenium, iodine, and copper, found in seafood and grass-fed red meat, support detoxification pathways.

While a completely toxin-free environment may be unattainable, taking proactive steps to minimize your exposure and support your body's natural defenses can help reduce the health risks associated with PFAS.
