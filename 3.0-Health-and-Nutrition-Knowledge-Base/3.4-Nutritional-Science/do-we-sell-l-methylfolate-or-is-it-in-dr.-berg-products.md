# Do we sell L-Methylfolate or is it in Dr. Berg Products?

L-Methylfolate is not an ingredient in any of our products. However, some of our products, such as Nerve Support with Benfotiamine and Natural Prenatal Vitamins, do contain 5-methyltetrahydrofolate calcium.

5-methyltetrahydrofolate calcium (or L-5-MTHF Ca) is the calcium salt of L-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, also known as Levomefolic acid or 5-MTHF. It is a biologically active form of folate, a B vitamin that is essential for various bodily functions.

Key points about 5-methyltetrahydrofolate calcium:

- **Biologically Active:** Unlike folic acid, which needs to be converted in the body, 5-MTHF is already in a usable form, making it easily absorbed and utilized.

- **Essential for Health:** It plays a crucial role in DNA synthesis, cell division, and amino acid metabolism. It is also vital for fetal development during pregnancy.

- **Benefits:** It may help prevent neural tube defects in babies, reduce the risk of heart disease, and improve mental health conditions.
