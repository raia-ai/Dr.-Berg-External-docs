# What are the most effective methods or treatments for dissolving kidney stones, and how do they work to aid in their dissolution and removal?

The most common type of kidney stone is a calcium oxalate stone. In this situation, you have high oxalates and calcium and low citrate.

You may have high oxalates from consuming too many high-oxalate foods. Oxalates are in a lot of foods, including keto-friendly foods. High calcium in the urine can be due to a genetic mutation. Your body makes citrates, which bind with calcium to lessen the amount of free calcium in the body. Free calcium is what can bind to oxalates.

Drinking more fluids during the day is one of the best ways to prevent kidney stones. I suggest drinking at least two and a half liters of fluids per day if you're prone to getting kidney stones. Another great way to prevent kidney stones is to add electrolyte powder containing potassium citrate or magnesium citrate to your water.
