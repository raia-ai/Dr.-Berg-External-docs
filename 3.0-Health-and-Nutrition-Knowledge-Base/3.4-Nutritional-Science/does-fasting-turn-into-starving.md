# Does fasting turn into starving?

You first need to know that the average non-overweight person is carrying around 100,000 calories of fat on their body. They are only carrying about 1,700 calories of stored sugar.

**If you weighed 150 lbs, you would burn around 1,000-2,000 calories per day. This means that you have around 67 days worth of calories stored on your body. The difference between fasting and starving is that with fasting, you’re living off of your fat fuel. When you’re starving, you’ve already used up all of your fat fuel, and you begin burning your muscle and organs for fuel.**

If you have 100-200 lbs of extra fat, you have many calories stored. The effects of fasting and starving are different. When you’re fasting, you don’t feel hungry—when you’re starving, you do. When you’re starving, you also feel irritable, apathetic, fatigued, and weak. You also develop nutrient deficiencies when you’re starving. Fasting helps you feel energetic, focus, and calm. Intermittent fasting alone will not cause starvation. While you’re fasting, make sure you take nutrients, so you don’t develop a deficiency.
