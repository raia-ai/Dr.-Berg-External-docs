# What are the potential health benefits associated with strontium supplementation?

Strontium is a powerful trace mineral whose chemistry is similar to calcium. It’s particularly helpful in building a strong outer shell on your bones, along with preventing hip fractures. The missing mineral that many people need to strengthen their bones is strontium, however, since it’s a trace mineral, you only need it in small amounts compared to calcium.

**Benefits**

- Good for bones and bone problems

- Can decrease the risk of bone fractures by up to 41%

- Good for osteoporosis or osteopenia

**How to consume it**

You need strontium and calcium in a 1:1000 ratio, where 1 is strontium and 1000 is calcium.

Consume strontium along with calcium aspartate anhydrous, vitamin D3, vitamin K2 and magnesium to support your bones and tackle any bone problem.

In addition to those nutrients, you need to have a sufficient amount of stomach acid to readily absorb minerals. Consume apple cider vinegar with each meal. You know that your stomach isn’t acidic enough if you have heartburn, acid reflux, or GERD.

If you have osteoporosis or osteopenia, it can take one to six years to regain your bone health. But it’s possible when you eat healthy foods and give your body the raw materials it needs.

**Where to get it**

Strontium doesn’t come in a form that’s easily absorbed by your body. Strontium is what’s called an elemental, inorganic mineral. Instead, you need the organic, plant-based form of it. Don’t take the elemental form.

One of the good sources of strontium is sea salt (can be found at the grocery store). You can also get it in a supplement form from a health food store or online.
