# What factors should be considered when deciding whether to administer antibiotics to your child as suggested by your doctor?

Antibiotics given to children can potentially increase the risk of certain things later in life, such as:

• Depression

• Autism

• Anxiety

• ADHD

**What you can do:**

- Be sure the antibiotics are necessary

- Make sure the child doesn’t consume foods that contain antibiotics (by purchasing foods that are organic, grass-fed and antibiotic-free)

- If the child has to take an antibiotic, make sure they also take a probiotic at the same time, and after they stop taking the antibiotic

- Allow the child’s immune system to learn from the environment

- Keep key nutrients high (zinc, calcium and vitamin D)
