# Is pork meat inflammatory?

Yes, pork can be inflammatory, especially if it is commercially bought and highly processed. Here are some key points from Dr. Berg's recommendations:

- **Commercially Bought Pork**: Commercially bought pork is often highly processed and may contain GMO grains, soy, and corn in the animal feed. Additionally, antibiotics and arsenic-based drugs are commonly used in livestock treatments, which can contribute to inflammation.

- **Formaldehyde in Feed**: Formaldehyde is sometimes used in pork feed to fight off bacteria, which can pose serious health risks and contribute to inflammation.

- **Processed Meats**: Processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which are often made from pork, are high in trans fats and can increase inflammation in the body.

To reduce inflammation, it is recommended to choose pasture-raised or grass-fed pork, which is less likely to contain harmful additives and is higher in beneficial nutrients.
