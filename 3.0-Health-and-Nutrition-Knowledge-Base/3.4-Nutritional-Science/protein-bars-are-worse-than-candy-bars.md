# Protein Bars Are WORSE than Candy Bars!!!

Let's compare popular snack bars to see what they really offer.

**Snickers:**

- 50 grams, 30 grams carbs, 58% sugar.

**Protein Bars:**

- **CLIF Builder's:** 68 grams, 20 grams protein (low-quality soy), high sugar, ultra-processed.

- **CLIF Energy:** 68 grams, 55.88% sugar, provides a short energy spike followed by a crash.

- **KIND:** Claims like "low glycemic index" are misleading, contains glucose syrup and other sugars.

- **Quest Birthday Cake:** 9 grams sugar alcohol (can cause GI issues), 41% sugar, contains polydextrose (not well-studied in humans).

- **Pure Protein:** Claims 2 grams sugar, but has 14 grams of starches (equivalent to more sugar).

- **ONE:** 60 grams, 20 grams protein, but 25 grams carbs from starches and cellulose (essentially sawdust), contains maltitol (avoid).

- **MET-Rx Meal Replacement:** 48 grams carbs, contains rice starch, maltitol syrup, corn syrup, fructose, soy protein isolate.

**Other Bars:**

- **RXBAR:** 10 grams protein, oats, cashews, egg whites, honey, but misleadingly labeled as 52% of its ingredients are sugar.

In summary, while marketed as healthier options, many snack bars contain high amounts of sugar, low-quality protein, and other questionable ingredients. It's important to read labels carefully and consider whole food alternatives for sustained energy and nutrition.
