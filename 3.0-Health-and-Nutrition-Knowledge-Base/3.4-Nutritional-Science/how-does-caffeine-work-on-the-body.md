# How does caffeine work on the body?

Caffeine is known to give you energy but how does this happen? It blocks adenosine, which is a chemical that inhibits your central nervous system. It’s the breaks of your nervous system. It increases dopamine which let you temporarily handle depression, inability to manage stress, focus…etc.

Too much caffeine might increase artery stiffness down the road. It also depletes vitamin B1, calcium, and potassium. So too much is not okay, but you can do a small amount of it.
