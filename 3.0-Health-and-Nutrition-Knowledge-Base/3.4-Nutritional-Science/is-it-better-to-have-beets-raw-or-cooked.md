# Is it better to have beets raw or cooked?

Raw beets are the most nutritious option. Cooked beets typically contain lower levels of health-promoting nitrates, vitamins, and phytochemicals.

If you don't enjoy the texture of raw beetroot, steaming them no longer than 15 minutes will soften the skin and flesh while preserving most of the nutrients.
