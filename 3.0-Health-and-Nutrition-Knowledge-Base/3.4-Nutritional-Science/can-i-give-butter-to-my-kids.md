# Can I give butter to my kids?

It would be a great idea to raise a child on cod liver oil and high-quality grass-fed butter to help support the childâ€™s teeth, heart and bones. Grass-fed butter is a great source of vitamin K2. You can also get vitamin K2 from grass-fed meat and cheese, egg yolks, and fermented vegetables.

Why vitamin K2 is important for infants and children:

- It plays a crucial role in the development of facial bones

- It can help prevent cavities and premature calcification of cartilage end plates

- It protects the heart

- It helps support the structure of the teeth

A mother who breastfeeds gives her child a lot of vitamin K2, while children who are not breastfed are more likely to have a vitamin K2 deficiency. Lactic acid bacteria in the gut can also convert vitamin K1 to K2.

Vitamin K2 activates the function of other fat-soluble vitamins (like vitamin A and vitamin D), which are important for the development of a healthy immune system in a child. Cod liver oil has a great balance of vitamin D and vitamin A.
