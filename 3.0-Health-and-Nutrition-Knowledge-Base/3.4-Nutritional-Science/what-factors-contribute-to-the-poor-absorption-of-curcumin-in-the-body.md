# What factors contribute to the poor absorption of curcumin in the body?

Curcumin is the main polyphenol or phytonutrient in the spice turmeric.

**Benefits of curcumin:**

• It has powerful antioxidant properties

• It’s a powerful anti-inflammatory

• It can be effective for exercise-induced inflammation

• It may help with muscle soreness

• It may help with exercise recovery

• It may help with arthritis

• It may help with anxiety

• It has been shown to be effective for metabolic syndrome

• It may be effective for degenerative eye conditions

The only problem is that curcumin doesn’t absorb well in the body. It’s fat-soluble, which means unless you take it in a certain way, you probably won’t absorb much of it.

**How to increase the absorption of curcumin:**

1\. Take it with piperine (black pepper)

2\. Take it with fat

3\. Heat it slightly
