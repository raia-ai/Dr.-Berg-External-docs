# What is the dawn phenomenon?

Magnesium deficiency has been linked to the dawn phenomenon, where blood sugar levels rise abnormally in the early morning hours. This connection highlights the important role magnesium plays in regulating glucose metabolism.

Magnesium influences gluconeogenesis, the process by which the liver produces glucose from non-carbohydrate sources.

In magnesium deficiency, this process can become dysregulated, leading to excessive glucose production, particularly in the morning when insulin sensitivity is naturally lower.  

Magnesium also plays a critical role in insulin sensitivity and action. Insulin receptors on cells require magnesium to function properly. When magnesium is deficient, insulin's ability to signal glucose uptake into cells is impaired, leading to insulin resistance and elevated blood sugar levels.
