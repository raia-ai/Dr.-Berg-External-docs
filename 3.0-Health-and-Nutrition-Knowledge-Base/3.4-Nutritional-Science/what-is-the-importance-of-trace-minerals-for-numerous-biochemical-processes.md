# What is the importance of trace minerals for numerous biochemical processes?

Trace minerals serve as cofactors essential for numerous biochemical processes. Obtaining sufficient amounts from a typical diet can be challenging, with sources like shellfish being notable exceptions. Furthermore, beneficial microbes in the soil play a critical role in mobilizing minerals from the soil matrix by dissolving them and making them available for plant roots to absorb. Certain farming practices can unfortunately deplete these soil microbial populations. Consequently, the absence or reduction of these microbes might limit plants' ability to take up essential minerals from the soil, contributing to nutrient deficiencies in crops.
