# What factors could explain the phenomenon of losing hair on the scalp while experiencing increased facial hair growth?

**This symptom is related to a condition called, PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome).**

Insulin resistance causes high androgens and if you are sensitive to androgens, your hair could fall out. But insulin resistance is not associated with PCOS, it CAUSES PCOS. Insulin resistance causes a spike in insulin which converts to androgens and facial hair growth.

**The solution is to do intermittent fasting and healthy ketosis.**
