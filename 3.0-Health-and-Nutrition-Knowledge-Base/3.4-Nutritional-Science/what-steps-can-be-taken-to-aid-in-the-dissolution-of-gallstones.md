# What steps can be taken to aid in the dissolution of gallstones?

**Worried about gallstones? Natural remedies might help!**

If you have a few gallstones, natural approaches could be worth exploring. Gallstones form when cholesterol becomes overly concentrated in your bile, lacking enough bile salts to keep it dissolved.

**Here's how to help dissolve gallstones naturally:**

1. **Increase Omega-3s:** Found in fatty fish and fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce cholesterol saturation in your bile. Cod liver oil is a great choice, offering the bonus of vitamins A and D.

2. **Supplement with Bile Salts:** Your body produces bile salts, but you can also take them in supplement form to help dissolve existing stones and prevent new ones from forming.

**Factors that may increase gallstone risk (and how to address them):**

- **High Insulin:** Reduce your intake of carbohydrates to help regulate insulin levels.

- **Elevated Cortisol:** Manage stress through relaxation techniques, exercise, and adequate sleep.

- **Estrogen Dominance:** If you suspect estrogen dominance, consult a healthcare professional to discuss ways to balance your hormones.

**Important Note:** While these natural remedies can be helpful, it's crucial to consult your doctor for diagnosis and to discuss the best treatment plan for your specific situation.
