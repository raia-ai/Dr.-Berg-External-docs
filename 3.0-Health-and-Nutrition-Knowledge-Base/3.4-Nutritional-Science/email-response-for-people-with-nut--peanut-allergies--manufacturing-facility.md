# Email Response for People with Nut & Peanut Allergies & Manufacturing Facility

Thank you for reaching out to us about potential peanut cross-contamination. We understand your concern and appreciate your taking the time to contact us. Our products and supplements themselves do not contain peanuts or tree nuts. However, there are peanut products in a different location within our manufacturing facility.

To ensure the safety of our customers with peanut allergies, we adhere to strict manufacturing processes:

- **Separate Facilities:** While peanut products are manufactured in our facility, they are produced in a completely separate area from our other products.

- **Thorough Cleaning:** We have rigorous cleaning procedures in place between production runs to minimize any risk of cross-contamination. This includes specialized cleaning of equipment and common areas.

- **Dedicated Equipment:**  Whenever possible, we use dedicated equipment for specific product lines to further reduce the potential for cross-contact.

- **Quality Control:** We have a robust quality control system that includes testing for allergens to ensure our products meet the highest safety standards.

While we take every precaution to prevent cross-contamination, we cannot guarantee that our products are 100% free of trace amounts of peanuts. This is a common challenge for manufacturers who produce multiple products in the same facility.
