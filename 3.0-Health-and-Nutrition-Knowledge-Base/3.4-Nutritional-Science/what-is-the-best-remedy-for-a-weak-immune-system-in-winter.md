# What is the best remedy for a weak immune system in winter?

The amazing immune benefits of garlic—especially during the winter. Garlic has been used as a natural remedy for various conditions for thousands of years.  Garlic is even ranked at the top for having potent anticancer effects, according to data from a study on the effects of cancer prevention from vegetables.   Most of the data we’re covering is from in vitro studies—not studies done on humans. 

**These studies found that garlic has the potential to kill:**

• E. coli 

• MRSA

• Anthrax 

**They found that garlic has a potent effect against:**

• Viruses 

• Fungi

• Parasites 

They even found that just the odor of garlic may help kill bacteria.  Garlic also has the ability to bind with organophosphates from pesticides and detoxify them from the body. Organophosphates can have a devastating effect on the immune system—they can make you susceptible to getting sick. But, garlic can help detoxify them and protect your immune system.
