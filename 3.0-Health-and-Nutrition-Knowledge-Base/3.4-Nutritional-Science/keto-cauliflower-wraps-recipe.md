# Keto Cauliflower Wraps Recipe

These are incredibly versatile for sandwiches, breakfast burritos, and even tacos. If you are one of those people who continually crave bread, this could be a fantastic keto-friendly substitute for you.

**Hereâ€™s how you can make them at home:**

1\. Steam 1/2 head of cauliflower (or 2 cups of riced cauliflower)

2\. Squeeze all of the water out using a towel

3\. Add 2 eggs and 1/4 tsp salt

4\. Mix in some herbs of your choice (I use Italian seasoning and 1 clove of garlic)

5\. Pour 1/4 cup of mix onto a baking sheet and spread it into a thin circle (but not too thin)

6\. Bake for 16-17 minutes (or until dry and pliable)

7\. Use a thin spatula to remove from the baking sheet and place on a cooling rack

8\. Enjoy!
