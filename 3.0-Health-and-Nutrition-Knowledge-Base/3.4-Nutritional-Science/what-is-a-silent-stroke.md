# What is a silent stroke?

**A silent stroke is a stroke that occurs without any symptoms. The damage it creates in the brain doesn’t affect vital areas, so you might not even know you had a stroke.**

The only cues of a silent stroke could be a small lapse in memory, fatigue, dizziness, or a mood change. But, one source states that they occur five times more often than strokes that produce classic symptoms. If a person has a stroke, they have an increased risk of having another one. Strokes are the second leading cause of death in the world.

One of the most common types of strokes involves a blood clot originating from an artery in the brain. A blood clot is a mechanism of healing a bleeding situation. So we need to look at what causes blood clots and the actual root causes of a stroke.

**Top predictors of a stroke:**

• A high-carb diet

• Diabetes
