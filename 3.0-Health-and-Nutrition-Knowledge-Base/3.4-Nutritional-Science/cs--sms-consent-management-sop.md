# CS- SMS Consent Management SOP

SMS Consent Management SOP 

 Federal regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) have considerably tightened the rules around company use of SMS text messaging. To communicate with contacts via SMS text messaging, **Dr. Berg Nutritionals must now obtain verbal or written 'express consent'.  Implied or assumed consent is no longer acceptable.**  

Dr. Berg Advisors/Customer Service must adhere to these regulations as the consequences of non-compliance with the TCPA are severe. Fines ranging from $500 to $1,500 are administered per non-compliant SMS text message.  

Once you have received consent from a contact to communicate via SMS, follow the steps below. 

Copy the Interaction ID  
Every interaction now has a Copy Interaction ID icon .  Press on the icon to copy the interaction ID to the clipboard.  

Paste and Save the Interaction ID 

 Click the three stacked dots icon in the Contact Info panel to open the selection menu. Click ‘Manage SMS Consent’ to open the Manage SMS Consent popup.

The Manage SMS Consent popup will display the contact's phone number(s). Click the toggle next to a phone number to mark or unmark the phone number for SMS consent. 

From the clipboard, paste the interaction ID into the ‘Enter Interaction ID’ field.

You can test the Interaction ID link by pressing the Open Link icon .  

Click on ‘APPLY’ to open the Confirmation Popup.
