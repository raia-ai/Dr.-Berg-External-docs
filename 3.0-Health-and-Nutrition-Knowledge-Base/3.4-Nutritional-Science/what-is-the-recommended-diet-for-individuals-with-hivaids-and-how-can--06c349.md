# What is the recommended diet for individuals with HIV/AIDS, and how can it support immune function and overall health?

When you have HIV, over time, if the immune system is weak, it can shift to AIDS. AIDS is a condition where you don't really have an immune system anymore.  This condition targets a key player in your immune system called the T helper cell. Without the T helper cells, your immune system can't work how it needs to. Without these cells, you can also develop serious secondary problems like tumors or cancer. 

Glutathione is the key antioxidant for all your cells, and it's intimately involved with your immune system. However, HIV depletes the precursors to make glutathione.  If you were to build up these precursors, and therefore, your glutathione, you could potentially prevent the transition of HIV to AIDS.  Other viruses use this mechanism, including hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and coxsackie. 

**A potential natural protocol for HIV and AIDS:** 

• Selenium (400 mcg) 

• Cysteine

• Glutamine

• Tryptophan 

• NAC
