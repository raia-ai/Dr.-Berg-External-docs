# What are the signs of methylcobalamin deficiency?

Methylcobalamin, a crucial form of vitamin B12, plays a vital role in DNA production, red blood cell formation, nerve health, and brain function. Deficiency in methylcobalamin can manifest in various symptoms including tingling, numbness, chronic pain, depression, muscle weakness, blurry vision, tinnitus, anemia, mouth ulcers, sore throat, and hair loss. Risk factors for deficiency include malabsorption issues, vegan diets, gastric bypass surgery, stomach conditions like gastritis, H. pylori infection, certain medications, and lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption, smoking, and pregnancy. If you suspect you may be deficient in vitamin B12, it is important to consult your doctor for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
