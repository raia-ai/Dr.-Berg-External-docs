# Is carbonated water healthier than still water?

There’s no evidence that carbonated water is better or worse for you than non-carbonated water. However, when some people consume carbonated water, their digestion is better.

That could be because:

- Carbonic acid could buffer the pH

- It acidifies the digestive system

Below a pH of 7, things are more acidic. Because the stomach has the lowest pH of any part of the body, carbonic acid – being a weak acid – might be better than regular water for some people.

Types of carbonated water:

- Seltzer water – no minerals, carbonated

- Club soda – minerals, carbonated

- Tonic water – quinine, carbonated
