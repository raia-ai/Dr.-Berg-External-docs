# What is the most effective natural antihistamine for managing allergy symptoms?

Histamines are developed when you encounter something you’re allergic to, during an infection, or after an injury. Histamines are also in our food supply.
**Symptoms of histamines can include:**

• Mucus

• Sneezing

• Runny nose

• Itchy eyes

• Watery eyes

• Red eyes

Certain organs, like your liver and kidneys, have enzymes that help you break down histamines. It’s important to support your liver and kidneys to help get rid of histamines.

**The best remedies for dealing with histamines are:**

1\. Grass-fed beef kidney extract

2\. Grass-fed beef liver extract

3\. Milk thistle

**It’s also important to avoid consuming things high in histamines, including fermented foods and drinks.
