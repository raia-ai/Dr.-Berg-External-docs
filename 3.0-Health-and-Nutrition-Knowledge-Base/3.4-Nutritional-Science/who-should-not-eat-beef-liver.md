# Who should not eat beef liver?

Pregnant women should limit or avoid liver due to its exceptionally high vitamin A content, which may increase the risk of birth defects. In addition, individuals with elevated iron levels, known as hemochromatosis, should limit iron-rich foods such as liver and other organ meats to minimize the risk of iron toxicity.
