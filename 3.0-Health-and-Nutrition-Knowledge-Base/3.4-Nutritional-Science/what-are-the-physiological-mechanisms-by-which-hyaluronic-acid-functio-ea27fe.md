# What are the physiological mechanisms by which hyaluronic acid functions in the body?

It's essential to consider your starting point if you consider using this as a supplement. Consider that an average 45-year-old adult might have between 14-15 grams of hyaluronic acid in their body.

By age 80, this number drops considerably, usually closer to 3.6 grams. This drastic reduction highlights why incorporating foods and supplements that help replenish hyaluronic acid as you age can be essential.

Bone broth and organ meats are great sources of this vital nutrient. More often than not, a dose of 200 milligrams per day is a great starting point to experience the many hyaluronic acid benefits.

It's also important to remember that, as with anything, moderation is key. A word of caution: Avoid going overboard and exceeding the recommended daily amount.

A friend of mine decided to take incredibly high doses because he thought, "if a little is good, a lot must be better." He ended up taking close to 3,000-4,000 milligrams per day.

Remember how I mentioned hyaluronic acid swells up as it absorbs water? Well, since he consumed such a large amount, he began experiencing quite a few severe side effects.

This compound was essentially swelling up in his body. In the end, he found drinking straight brandy helped dissolve it, and eventually, he felt much better. Of course, this isn't something I would recommend doing.
