# What are some overlooked signs of an iodine deficiency?

Overlooked signs of an iodine deficiency:

1\. Estrogen dominance. Iodine helps regulate estrogen and helps prevent estrogen dominance. It also supports detoxification.

2\. High cortisol levels. Iodine helps normalize cortisol levels.

3\. A hypothyroid condition. Hypothyroidism can cause the cholesterol in your body to be elevated but unusable for making vitamin D, cell membranes, and bile.

4\. Side effects when consuming soy products. Iodine helps buffer the estrogen effects of consuming soy products.

5\. Hashimoto's. You still need iodine if you have Hashimoto's, but not excess iodine. You may also need selenium, zinc, vitamin D, and myo-inositol.
