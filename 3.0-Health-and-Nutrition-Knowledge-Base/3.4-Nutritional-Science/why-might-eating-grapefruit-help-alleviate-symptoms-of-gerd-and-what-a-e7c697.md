# Why might eating grapefruit help alleviate symptoms of GERD, and what are the mechanisms behind this effect?

Grapefruit contains phytonutrients that can aid digestion and act as a natural antacid, potentially alleviating GERD symptoms. Additionally, incorporating foods like broccoli sprouts or cabbage may offer similar benefits. GERD often relates to a valve issue or insufficient stomach acid, which can sometimes be addressed with betaine hydrochloride supplementation.
