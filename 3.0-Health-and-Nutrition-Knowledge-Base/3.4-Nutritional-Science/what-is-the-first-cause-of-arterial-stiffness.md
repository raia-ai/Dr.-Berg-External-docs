# What is the first cause of arterial stiffness?

Unfortunately, heart attacks, strokes, and high blood pressure are common problems. So, today we’re going to talk about what causes arterial stiffness or calcified arteries. 

**Common causes of stiff arteries:** 

• Age

• Inflammation 

• A high-carb, high-sugar diet 

• Omega-6 fatty acids 

There is one additional cause of hardened arteries that many people are unaware of, and it’s a vitamin K2 deficiency.  Vitamin K2 drives calcium into the bones to help make them stronger and keeps calcium out of the arteries and the walls of the arteries. Vitamin K2 may decrease the risk of heart attack by 50 percent.
