# What are effective ways to support bile flow?

The discomfort youâ€™re experiencing may not originate from the gallbladder itself, but rather from the bile ducts, where thicker bile and cholesterol can create pressure and lead to pain.

To address this issue, it's important to promote bile flow. Incorporating choline into your daily regimen and taking bile salts with meals can help enhance bile production, facilitating a smoother flow through the ducts and alleviating discomfort. You may need a higher dosage than average to achieve optimal results.

During this time, it's advisable to avoid nuts, peanut butter, and dairy products. Moderate consumption of saturated fats from meat can actually stimulate bile production without worsening your condition. However, be cautious with coconut oil, vegetable oils, and fried foods high in omega-6 fatty acids, as these can exacerbate the problem. On the other hand, fatty fish like salmon should not aggravate gallbladder issues and can be beneficial.
