# Why does removing your gallbladder makes you fat?

Removing your gallbladder can lead to weight gain for several reasons, mainly due to the important role of bile, a substance concentrated and stored in the gallbladder, in various bodily functions.

Thyroid Hormone Conversion:

Bile is essential for converting thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism. Without enough bile, the conversion process is hampered, potentially slowing down your metabolism.

• Insulin Sensitivity: Bile helps maintain insulin sensitivity. A lack of bile can lead to increased insulin levels, contributing to weight gain.

• Gut Microbiome: A healthy gut microbiome is influenced by bile. Without sufficient bile, the balance of gut bacteria can shift, leading to weight gain.

Constipation:

Bile acts as a natural lubricant in the intestines. Without it, you might experience constipation and retain waste, adding to body weight.

• Bloating: A deficiency in bile can cause bloating and swelling in the belly area, making you feel and look heavier.

• Fatty Liver: Bile helps prevent fatty liver, a condition linked to weight gain. Without enough bile, the risk of developing fatty liver increases.

To mitigate these effects, supplementing with bile salts can be beneficial, especially for those without a gallbladder. Bile salts can help replicate some of the gallbladder's functions, aiding in digestion and preventing some of the weight gain associated with gallbladder removal.
