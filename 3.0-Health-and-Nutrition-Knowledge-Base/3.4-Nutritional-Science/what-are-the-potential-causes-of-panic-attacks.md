# What are the potential causes of panic attacks?

**Cause #1: High amounts of stress**

High amounts of stress can cause your adrenals (stress-regulating glands) to overwork and not function properly. When they are not functioning correctly, they canâ€™t control a high amount of stress and overcome it. The solution would be to support your nervous system and brain so your adrenals are able to calm your body down if it receives a sudden stress.

**Cause #2: Hypoglycemia (especially if you get a panic attack for no clear reason)**

If you are on a high-carb diet, this can cause spikes in your blood sugar levels, and as result, your body will increase Insulin (fat-storing hormone) to lower it. Eventually, this can result in your body overproducing insulin as your cells are becoming resistant to it. Insulin, in its turn, will cause severe drops of blood sugar levels.

This is called hypoglycemia (too-low blood sugar). Hypoglycemia alone has symptoms of anxiety, panic attacks, fear, etc.

One of the ways to test whether low blood sugar is causing panic attacks is this: if you consume fewer sweets and carbs and you feel calmer, then hypoglycemia is the underlying issue.
