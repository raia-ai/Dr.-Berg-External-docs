# Easy Keto Piece Crust Recipe

If you're looking for a keto pie crust recipe that's not only nutritious but also delicious, you should give this a try. You can make this simple pie crust to go with sweet pies or a savory quiche. Check out one of my low-carb recipes below so you can make it at home with or without an occasion. 

**My Keto Pie Crust Recipe:**

**Ingredients**

• 1 ½ cup almond flour

• ¼ tsp baking soda

• 1 ½ tbsp melted butter from grass-fed animals

• ¼ tsp salt

• 1 organic egg

• ¼ tsp vanilla

• 1 tbsp powdered sweetener (This is if the crust is used for the pie. If for the keto quiche, don't add sweetener or a sugar substitute.)

**Directions:**

1\. Preheat oven at 350 °F.

2\. Mix all ingredients in a food processor, not in a mixing bowl. Mix until it balls up. Dump the keto pie crust dough onto the pie plate and spread thin. 

3\. The almond flour pie crust thickens, so you can press it quite thin. 

4\. Bake the crust at 350 °F for 8-10 minutes. 

5\. This can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days if made in advance.
