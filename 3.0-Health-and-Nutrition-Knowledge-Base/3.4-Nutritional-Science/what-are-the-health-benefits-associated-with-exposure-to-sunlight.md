# What are the health benefits associated with exposure to sunlight?

The sun is an excellent source of vitamin D, which has the capacity to lower cortisol by up to 40%.

Cortisol is a stress hormone and can cause weight gain, especially belly fat. High cortisol levels throughout your day can cause your stomach to be larger at the end of the day after dealing with different stressors.

The best source of vitamin D is sunlight, but you can also find vitamin D in fatty fish, mushrooms, cod liver oil, grass-fed dairy, and egg yolks.

**Some of the benefits of vitamin D include:**

•Helps the body absorb calcium

•Supports bone health

•Supports immune function

•Lowers cortisol

•Lowers insulin
