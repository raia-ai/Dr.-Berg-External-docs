### **Hypochlorhydria or Achlorhydria - Consequences of Over-Alkalization**

In extreme cases of over-alkalization, [low potassium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/top-symptoms-of-having-low-potassium) and calcium levels in the blood might occur. You wouldn't want that.

### **Alkalosis and Urinary Health**

The pH balance in our urine plays a crucial role in maintaining urinary health. Drinking excessive amounts of alkaline water can upset this delicate balance.

This alteration potentially heightens infection risk because an imbalance allows harmful bacteria to thrive more easily. [Studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3571898) that urinary tract infections are more common when the urine's pH is imbalanced.
