# What are the most beneficial foods for women during pregnancy?

For pregnant women, the most critical time to eat healthily is during pregnancy, before conception, and while breastfeeding, as nutrients are crucial for the developing baby. Here are some key recommendations:

1\. **Pickles**: They provide electrolytes and beneficial bacteria, especially if fermented.

2\. **Nutrient-Dense Foods**: Ensure a healthy intake of essential nutrients, particularly iodine and vitamin D. Iodine is vital for brain development, while vitamin D supports proper bone formation.

3\. **Healthy Keto Diet**: Follow a nutrient-rich ketogenic diet, but avoid intermittent fasting during pregnancy.

Proper nutrition during these periods is essential to prevent deficiencies that can lead to developmental issues such as reduced IQ, bone deformities, and dental problems.
