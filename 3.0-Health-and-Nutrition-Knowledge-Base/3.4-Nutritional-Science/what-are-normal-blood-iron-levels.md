# What are normal blood iron levels?

Blood iron levels can be measured in a few ways, including serum iron, ferritin, and total iron binding capacity (TIBC). Consult with your medical professional to conduct testing, review results, and build a healthy blood iron plan.

- **Serum iron**

    Normal levels for men are 50–150 mcg/dL, and for women are 35–145 mcg/dL. Low levels for men are below 76 mcg/dL, and for women are below 26 mcg/dL. High levels for men are above 198 mcg/dL, and for women are above 170 mcg/dL. 

- **Ferritin**

    Normal levels for men are 30–400 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL), and for women are 13–150 ng/mL. Low levels may indicate iron deficiency anemia, while high levels may indicate hemochromatosis. 

- **Total iron binding capacity (TIBC)**

    Normal levels for men are 171–505 mcg/dL, and for women are 149–492 mcg/dL. 

Medical professionals, not Dr. Berg, have established these low, high, and normal blood iron test levels. These levels are provided for informational purposes only. Please consult your medical doctor to discuss more detailed and individualized information on blood iron levels.
