# What is the underlying mechanism by which hyaluronic acid exerts its effects at the molecular and cellular levels within biological systems?

Having enough [vitamin A](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-a-functions-and-deficiencies) actually increases hyaluronic acid production. This might be why people who are deficient in this vital vitamin tend to have problems with dry eyes and skin. Even the fluid within your eye contains large amounts of hyaluronic acid.

What many don't realize is that after a certain age, this crucial compound begins to decline in our bodies. You primarily start to see a reduction in hyaluronic acid around your 40s and 50s.

By the time you are 80 years old, you will have lost nearly 80% of your natural hyaluronic acid production. This decline can lead to noticeable changes in the skin, such as wrinkles and sagging.

To give you a better idea of the powerful effects of hyaluronic acid, consider the rare genetic disease called progeria, which causes children to age rapidly.

Kids with progeria experience a 20-fold reduction in hyaluronic acid levels compared to individuals who do not have this rare condition.

When comparing images of young skin to those with older, more mature skin, the differences are easy to spot. Older skin wrinkles and sags, making it usually easy to spot someone who is deficient in hyaluronic acid and doesnâ€™t reap its amazing skin benefits.
