# What foods can make you live longer?

Certain foods rich in specific molecules can potentially enhance longevity by supporting mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress:

1\. **PQQ**: Found in cacao, boosts mitochondrial count and supports energy production.

2\. **Polyphenols**: Found in berries, grass-fed meats, and cheese, enhance mitochondrial function and reduce inflammation.

3\. **Coenzyme Q10**: Found in liver, red meat, and fatty fish, essential for mitochondrial energy production and acts as an antioxidant.

4\. **L-carnitine and carnosine**: Found in red meat, support fat burning, muscle preservation, and reduce oxidative stress.

5\. **Phycocyanin**: Found in spirulina, supports mitochondrial biogenesis and has antioxidant properties.

6\. **EPA and DHA**: Found in salmon, sardines, and cod liver oil, improve mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress, and have anti-inflammatory effects.

Incorporating these foods into your diet may increase mitochondrial health, improve energy production, reduce inflammation, and potentially slow down aging processes.
