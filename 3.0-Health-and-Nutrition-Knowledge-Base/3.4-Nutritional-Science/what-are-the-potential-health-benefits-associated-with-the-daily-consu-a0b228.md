# What are the potential health benefits associated with the daily consumption of cloves?

**Clove is natural, and there is a lot of interesting research on using it to promote a healthy body. One of the most common ways to use clove is as a numbing agent for a toothache.** The essential oil in clove called eugenol produces many benefits. But it also contains a lot of other phytonutrients.

You can use clove oil or simply chew and swallow a piece of clove. You can also use clove oil topically on the scalp for fungus or pathogens. It may even help reduce the toxicity created as a byproduct of fungus.

- Clove may help enhance the effects of an antibiotic, allowing you to use lower amounts of it.

- Clove oil may also help inhibit H. pylori and improve peptic ulcers, gastritis, indigestion, gas, and bloating.

- A certain phytonutrient in clove is an MAO inhibitor. MAO inhibitors are used as antidepressants.

- Clove even has anti-inflammatory effects, and data shows it has anticancer properties.

**Clove is relatively safe, but consuming too much clove oil could create a toxic effect. You should avoid clove if you are allergic to it or are pregnant or lactating.**
