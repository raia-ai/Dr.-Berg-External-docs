# Why is it difficult to sleep without carbohydrates?

It can take a long time to fix insulin resistance, even once you make the switch to a ketogenic diet. With insulin resistance, you have higher amounts of insulin. With keto, you consume lower amounts of carbohydrates. But, you're still going to have high insulin despite cutting out the carbs because of the resistance problem.

Higher amounts of insulin can push the blood sugars down too low in the middle of the night. With low blood sugars, you have counter hormones that keep your blood sugars from going down too low. The two main ones are cortisol and adrenaline. These two hormones are behind many sleeping problems.

**What to do if you can't fall asleep without carbs:**

1\. Time (as you fix insulin resistance, this problem will get better)

2\. Take electrolytes (potassium, magnesium, and calcium)

3\. Take apple cider vinegar before bed

4\. Adjust the amount of protein you consume as your last meal

5\. Consume more vegetables

6\. Take vitamin B1

7\. Limit caffeine consumption

8\. Take exogenous ketones before bed

9\. Get more vitamin D by being in the sun or by taking vitamin D
