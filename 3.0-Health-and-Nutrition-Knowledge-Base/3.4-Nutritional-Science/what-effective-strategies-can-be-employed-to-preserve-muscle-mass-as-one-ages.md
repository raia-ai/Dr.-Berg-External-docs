# What effective strategies can be employed to preserve muscle mass as one ages?

Around age 50, women experience menopause, leading to hormonal shifts, while men undergo similar changes around age 60. These changes can contribute to sarcopenia, or muscle loss, affecting metabolic health.

Estrogen and progesterone decline in women with age, impacting muscle health. Cholesterol, essential for steroid hormone production like testosterone and estrogen, plays a crucial role in muscle maintenance. Low-cholesterol diets and statin drugs can contribute to muscle issues.

To support hormone balance and muscle preservation:

1. Use infrared light, such as sunlight or fire, to boost melatonin production.

2. Regular resistance exercises are vital for muscle maintenance.

3. Ensure adequate intake of animal protein.

4. Include cholesterol-rich foods like meat and dairy in your diet.

5. Consider pregnenolone supplements (30 mg/day for women, 100 mg/day for men).

6. Supplement with DHEA (25 mg/day for women, 100 mg/day for men) to support muscle-building hormones.
