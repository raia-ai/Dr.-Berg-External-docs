# What strategies and lifestyle changes can be implemented to effectively reduce the risk of cancer?

Would you be willing to invest 14 cents a day in your health, to decrease your risk of cancer? Good news: consuming broccoli sprouts is an inexpensive yet highly effective preventative. These sprouts have ten to one hundred times the concentration of a sulphur-rich phytonutrient called sulforaphane, as compared to mature broccoli. One ounce of broccoli sprouts is equivalent to two pounds of adult broccoli.

Broccoli sprouts are the tiny plants that take 3 to 4 days to sprout from seed. You can get them at grocery stores, often at the salad bar. I highly recommend putting them on your salad each day as a kind of health insurance. Their sulphur content helps neutralize and expel the toxins that can cause cancer.

Of course, if you buy them already sprouted they’re more expensive. 14 cents per day is the cost for you to sprout them yourself. I’ve sprouted them myself for quite a few years. It’s simple and inexpensive to get the equipment you need; simply look up the directions online.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death behind heart disease. Broccoli sprouts support what’s called phase 1 and phase 2 detoxification in your liver. This means the sprouts contain enzymes that turn poison into harmless particles, which is important since toxins in the body are the cause of cancer. Sulforaphane in the sprouts helps to dismantle and clean out the toxins. While other sprouts like radish and kale have a similar effect, broccoli is the most powerful to help reduce your risk of cancer.
