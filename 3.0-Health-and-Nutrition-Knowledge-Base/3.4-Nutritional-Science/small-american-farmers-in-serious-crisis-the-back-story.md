# Small American Farmers in Serious Crisis: The Back Story

**The Regulatory Roadblocks for Small Farmers**

Joel Salatin believes our food system is overly regulated. Government, food, and zoning laws create massive hurdles for small farmers trying to compete. That's why he and John Moody founded the Rogue Food Conference in 2020. Their motto? "Circumvention, not compliance." When laws stifle fair competition, they advocate finding creative ways to work around excessive regulation.

The upcoming Rogue Food Conference at Joel's Polyface Farms in Virginia will explore these strategies. Expect discussions on private membership associations and clever models like selling food as part of a course (think a $300 butchering class that includes 50 pounds of meat).

The conference happens twice a year – this year in Virginia (spring) and Dallas (fall).

Want to support the cause? Ditch the big supermarkets and shop at farmers' markets for locally grown, healthier food. Seek out small, independent food stores, and don't be afraid to ask for specific items – even if not currently in stock, farmers have a great network!

Finding real food from dedicated farmers might take effort, but the health benefits are undeniable.
