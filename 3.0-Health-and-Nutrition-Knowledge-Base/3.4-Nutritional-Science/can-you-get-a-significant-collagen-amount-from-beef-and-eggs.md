# Can you get a significant collagen amount from beef and eggs?

Many people mistakenly believe they get enough collagen from eating steak, meat, or eggs. The truth is, while collagen is a major protein in the body (about 30% of total protein), dietary sources are limited to things like bone broth, animal skins, pork rinds, and gelatin. Muscle meat alone doesn't provide it.

Collagen is essential for connective tissues – tendons, ligaments, muscles, and fascia – and contributes to skin structure (reducing sagging/wrinkles) and bone elasticity. It's key for healing and particularly important as we age.

Recognizing the difficulty in getting sufficient collagen from diet alone, we offer a collagen product called Multi Collagen Peptide. It features multiple types of collagen along with vital cofactors like natural Vitamin C, formulated to provide comprehensive support for your body's collagen needs.
