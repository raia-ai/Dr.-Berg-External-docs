# Why is zinc an important trace mineral?

Zinc is an essential mineral vital for numerous bodily functions. It is particularly crucial for the senses of smell and taste; a deficiency can impair these senses, potentially affecting appetite and food choices. Zinc is also necessary for the body to utilize Vitamin A, and a deficiency in either can impact vision, especially night vision. Globally, zinc deficiency is a significant health issue, tragically contributing to child mortality from conditions like diarrhea in certain regions. A contributing factor to deficiency, even when zinc is consumed, is the presence of phytic acid in foods like cereals, which can block zinc absorption. Furthermore, zinc is important for maintaining gut health and the integrity of the intestinal barrier.
