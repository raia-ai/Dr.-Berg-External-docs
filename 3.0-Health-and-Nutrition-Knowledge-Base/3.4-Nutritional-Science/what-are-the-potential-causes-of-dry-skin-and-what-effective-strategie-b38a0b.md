# What are the potential causes of dry skin, and what effective strategies and treatments can be employed to alleviate this condition?

Dry, cracked, or scaly skin can cause a lot of irritation. Although harsh chemicals can cause skin dryness, the most common dietary cause is low levels of omega-3 fatty acid.

**Cause #1: Lack of alpha-linolenic acid:**

Alpha-linolenic acid is mainly involved in building and making the structure of your body cells. It is crucial for providing moisture to the skin and reducing inflammation.

**Cause #2: Lack of bile**

If you eat the above foods and your dry skin condition doesnâ€™t resolve, it could mean that these acids are not digested well. Particularly, lack of bile can cause an inability to digest and absorb alpha-linolenic acid from food. This can be due to a removed gallbladder or liver/gallbladder- related problems.
