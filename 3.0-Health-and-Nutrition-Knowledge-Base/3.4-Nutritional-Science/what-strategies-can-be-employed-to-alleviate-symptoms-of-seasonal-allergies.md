# What strategies can be employed to alleviate symptoms of seasonal allergies?

Pollen allergies trigger histamine-driven immune reactions, causing symptoms like mucus production and fatigue. Gradual pollen exposure can desensitize the body. Bee pollen, rich in nutrients and anti-inflammatory properties, includes various local pollens.

**Benefits of Bee Pollen:**

\- Anti-inflammatory and wound-healing effects

\- Contains friendly microbes, amino acids, antioxidants, essential fatty acids, hormones, vitamins, and minerals

**How to Use Bee Pollen:**

Start with 2-3 grains daily, increasing gradually over a week. Adults can eventually take 2-5 teaspoons daily, children 1-2 teaspoons. Chew, grind, or soak in water.

**Other Natural Allergy Remedies:**

Include quercetin, onions, and stinging nettle. Support liver health during allergy seasons.

Initiate the pollen exposure protocol before spring, repeating 2-3 times yearly for best results.
