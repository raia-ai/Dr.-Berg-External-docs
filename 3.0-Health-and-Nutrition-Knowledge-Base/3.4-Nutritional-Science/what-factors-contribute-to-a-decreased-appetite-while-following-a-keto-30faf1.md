# What factors contribute to a decreased appetite while following a ketogenic diet and practicing intermittent fasting?

Some people experience a decreased appetite on the Healthy Keto® diet. Although you are taking energy from your body fat and don’t feel the need of food, it is important to note that food has an additional purpose--to provide nutrients. For example if you are deficient in electrolytes and you don’t eat, you can pass out, have low blood pressure etc. While you may not feel hungry because you’re burning enough fat to keep your body supplied with energy, you still need micronutrients.

**What to do:**

If you aren’t hungry for days at a time, it’s important to still eat a nutrient-dense meal once or twice a day. Make sure the meals that you eat are rich in nutrients. Lowering your fat intake may also help you regain your appetite.

- Don’t stop eating.

    - Eat one good meal per day if you want to lose weight

    - Eat two meals per day if you want to maintain your weight

- You can lower your fat intake gradually (to improve appetite)

- Avoid appetite blockers.
