# What are the benefits of Black Pepper on DIM supplement Estrogen Balance?

**DIM Supplement Estrogen Balance - Black Pepper Extract (Piper nigrum) (fruit)**  

Turmeric and black pepper are two spices often used together in traditional practices. Turmeric contains a compound called curcumin, while black pepper contains a compound called piperine. Research has shown that piperine can increase the bioavailability of curcumin. 

Here's how it works: 

- **Increased Absorption:** Black pepper contains a compound called piperine, which has been found to influence the absorption of curcumin, a compound found in turmeric. 

- **Enhanced Bioavailability:** This means that more curcumin becomes available for the body to use, potentially increasing its effectiveness.
