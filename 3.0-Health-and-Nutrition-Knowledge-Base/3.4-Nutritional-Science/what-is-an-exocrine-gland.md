# What is an exocrine gland?

An exocrine gland is a type of gland that releases its secretions through ducts to an epithelial surface or into body cavities. Unlike endocrine glands, which secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream, exocrine glands produce substances such as enzymes, sweat, saliva, and other digestive juices, which are then transported via ducts to their target areas. In the context of the pancreas, the exocrine function involves the production and secretion of digestive enzymes that help break down food in the intestine.
