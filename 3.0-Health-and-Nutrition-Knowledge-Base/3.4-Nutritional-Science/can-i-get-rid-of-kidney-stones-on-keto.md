# Can I get rid of kidney stones on keto?

The ketogenic diet itself doesn't directly counter kidney stones, but certain remedies can help prevent them:

1\. Phytic acid can prevent calcium crystallization, a common cause of kidney stones. Increase intake by consuming moderate protein and plenty of vegetables.

2\. Take vitamin C to bind with calcium and prevent stone formation.

3\. Stay hydrated and add electrolytes to your fluids, especially if sedentary.

4\. Drink lemon water and ensure adequate intake of vitamin B6 and calcium-rich foods like grass-fed dairy.

5\. Consider calcium orotate as a supplement, as it may reduce calcium buildup in the kidneys.

6\. Address magnesium deficiency, but if consuming ample vegetables, additional supplementation may not be necessary.

If you've strayed from the keto plan, simply resume it along with intermittent fasting. Gradually transition into ketosis, reduce snacking, and supplement with potassium, sodium, and nutritional yeast. Additionally, take the opportunity to deepen your understanding of the ketogenic diet to enhance self-control and success.
