# What are the various causes of hearing loss, including genetic, environmental, and age-related factors, and how do they affect auditory function?

Your hearing function is dependent on your thyroid and iodine. Your thyroid gland regulates energy levels in your body, including those in your brain. Some of the brain parts that are responsible for hearing function require normal thyroid function for hearing to happen.

**Cause #1: Iodine deficiency**

Low levels of iodine can reduce the production of thyroid hormones and lead to dysfunction of the brain areas that control your hearing. Pregnant women commonly have iodine deficiencies, which can transmit to their infants--causing them to have hearing problems and other side effects.
