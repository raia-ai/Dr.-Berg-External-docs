# What are the possible causes of dark circles under a child's eyes?

**It has to do with an iron deficiency. It does not mean that the child has anemia, but they may have anemia. Iron is involved in different chemical pathways and enzymes.**  

**Iron deficiency symptoms** 

• Fatigue 

• Dizziness

• Pale 

• Irritable 

• Ice cravings

• Delayed growth 

**Children should not take iron supplements from a drug store for dark circles under the eyes. Always do food-based iron, a food-based complex, or just the food. The child should also be consuming vegetables because when someone has an iron deficiency, they probably have other deficiencies.**
