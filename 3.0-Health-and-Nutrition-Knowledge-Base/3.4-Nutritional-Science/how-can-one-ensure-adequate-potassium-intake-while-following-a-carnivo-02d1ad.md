# How can one ensure adequate potassium intake while following a carnivore diet, given its limited variety of food sources?

**You need 4700 mg of potassium each day, more than any other mineral.**

Potassium is important for the sodium-potassium pump present in all of your cells, which allows the contraction and relaxation of your nerves.

**Too much potassium is known as hyperkalemia, and too little is known as hypokalemia. Symptoms of high potassium include diarrhea, muscle pain, and muscle numbness. Symptoms of low potassium include constipation, muscle cramps, and fatigue.**

**Potassium is vital for exercise performance.** If you don’t have enough, you’ll probably feel weak or tired. One of the causes of low potassium is low magnesium.

**Kidney disease can cause high potassium.** If the kidney is not functioning properly, it won’t be able to get rid of potassium. It’s very rare to develop too much potassium in the blood from dietary intake.

**Blood pressure medications or side effects of an adrenal condition known as Addison's can also cause high potassium.** Diuretics and steroids can cause low potassium. Surgeries and injuries can also cause low potassium.

**The following vegetables are some of the best sources of potassium:**

•1 cup of beet leaves 1300 mg

•1 cup of Swiss chard 900 mg

•1 cup spinach 840 mg

•1 avocado 500-700 mg

•1 cup of beets 520 mg

•1 cup of salad 350-500 mg

Bananas contain around 300 mg of potassium but have too much sugar.

•3 ½ oz octopus 650 mg
