# What are the key differences between niacin and niacinamide in terms of their biochemical properties, physiological effects, and potential applications in health and wellness?

**Niacin and niacinamide are both forms of vitamin B3, but they have distinct effects on the body:**

**Niacin:**

- Causes a temporary flushing response.

- Improves cholesterol levels (lowers LDL, raises HDL).

- Supports heart and liver health.

- May have benefits for mental health conditions.

**Niacinamide:**

- Does not cause flushing.

- Promotes healthy skin (helps with acne, inflammation, and hyperpigmentation).

- May support joint health and reduce anxiety.
