# What lowers copper in your body?

Taking zinc supplementation and consuming zinc-rich foods, such as beef, shellfish, eggs, and dairy products, can help reduce copper absorption and toxicity. 

Additionally, women who are estrogen-dominant or taking hormonal contraceptives may benefit from a Diindolylmethane (DIM) supplement. DIM has been found to promote sex hormone balance, which may help reduce intestinal copper absorption.
