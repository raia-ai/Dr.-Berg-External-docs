# What does folate 100 mcg DFE mean on the B1+ bottle?

Dietary Folate Equivalents (DFE) is a unit of measurement used to account for the varying bioavailability of folate from different sources.

1\. 1 mcg DFE = 1 mcg of food folate (naturally occurring in foods like leafy greens or legumes) .

2\. 1 mcg DFE = 0.6 mcg of folic acid (from fortified foods or supplements consumed with food) .

3\. 1 mcg DFE = 0.5 mcg of folic acid (from supplements taken on an empty stomach)

Our folate in B1+ comes from food folate.

Our manufacturer included DFE on the Natural B1+ label to comply with the updated folate labeling requirement for supplements. The folate content in the B1+, including DFE, has not changed; only the labeling requirement has been updated.
