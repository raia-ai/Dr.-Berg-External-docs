# What sugar or carbs can I eat on intermittent fasting?

Intermittent fasting doesnâ€™t necessarily require you to not eat carbs or sugar. You can eat them if you want, although it will not be effective.

Doing intermittent fasting and the keto diet together brings the best benefits. In which case you should only eat 20 to 50 g net carbs a day, meaning total carbs minus fiber.

If you crave sweetness, check for some safe keto-friendly alternatives like stevia or monk fruit.
