# What are some effective and scientifically supported natural remedies for mitigating the symptoms of anemia?

Iron deficiency anemia is either a case of lowered red blood cells, decreased hemoglobin, or a decreased ability to carry oxygen through the blood.

Iron deficiency symptoms include feeling tired, craving ice, weakness, and shortness of breath. In advanced cases, paleness is also a sign of iron deficiency.

Several things can cause iron deficiency anemia. Blood loss caused by menstruation or trauma, ulcers, parasites, fibroids, cancer, infections, and genetics are all potential causes of iron deficiency. One of the most common causes of iron deficiency is decreased absorption of iron caused by low hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Many people have low stomach acid which causes problems like GERD, acid reflux, and heartburn.

Apple cider vinegar with your meal can increase the absorption of iron and also decrease the negative side effects of low stomach acid. Antacids can worsen the problem by further depleting your stomach acid, making the stomach more alkaline, and decreasing the absorption of iron.

Oxalates found in spinach and Swiss chard can also deplete iron. If your diet is high in grains, you’re probably consuming a lot of phytic acid which can also bind to important minerals and decrease their absorption. Gastric bypass surgery can cause you to become deficient in iron. This surgery decreases the surface area of the stomach and decreases the absorption of iron and other important minerals. Digestive problems like IBS, Crohn’s, and celiac can also cause you to become deficient in iron.

It can be helpful to add the following iron-rich foods to your diet if you have iron deficiency anemia:

•Clams

•Oysters

•Meat

•Eggs

•Liver (grass-fed)

•Octopus

•Spirulina
