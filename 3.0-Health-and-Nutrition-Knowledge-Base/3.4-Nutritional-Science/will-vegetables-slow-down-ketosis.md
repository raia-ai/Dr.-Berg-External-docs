# Will vegetables slow down ketosis?

They will not, especially if you avoid things like corn, carrots and potatoes. If you eliminate those you donâ€™t have to worry about the vegetable part of your diet slowing down ketosis.

Most ketogenic diets recommend 20 to 50 g of carbs per day without differentiating the types of carbohydrates. Dr Berg recommends that you get those carbs from your vegetable sources.
