# Does Nutritional Yeast contain MSG?

Nutritional yeast does not naturally contain MSG. Nutritional yeast will only contain MSG if added to the nutritional yeast.

All Dr. Berg Nutritionals' nutritional yeast products and those containing nutritional yeast are all-natural and do not contain MSG.

Nutritional yeast does contain naturally occurring glutamic acid but is not the same as the synthetic MSG used as a food additive.

Glutamic acid is an amino acid, one of the building blocks of proteins. In its natural form, glutamic acid is not harmful and is an essential component of our diet.

MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) is the sodium salt of glutamic acid. It is a synthetic compound produced through fermentation involving sugar beets, sugarcane, or starch. MSG is known for enhancing the savory or umami taste of foods. It is often used as a food additive to enhance the flavor of various dishes.
