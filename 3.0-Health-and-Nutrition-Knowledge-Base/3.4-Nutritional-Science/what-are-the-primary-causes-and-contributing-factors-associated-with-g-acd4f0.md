# What are the primary causes and contributing factors associated with Graves' disease?

Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid is producing too much thyroid hormone. In the whole thyroid-generating cycle there is no turn-off switch to the production of active thyroid hormone (T3) so it keeps being pumped out more and more.

Symptoms:

- Irritability

- Muscle weakness

- Sleeplessness

- Increased heart rate

- Heart hypertrophy

- Decreased tolerance to heat

- Diarrhea

- Eyes bulging out

- Tremor

- Panic and anxiety

**Cause #1: Gravesâ€™ disease (autoimmune)**

Graves disease is an autoimmune condition, which means that your own immune system attacks your own healthy body cells. This can affect your thyroid and can cause it to generate more active thyroid hormones than are needed, known as a hyperthyroid condition.

**Cause #2: Too much stress**

If you undergo consistent stress, this can cause a hyperthyroid condition and overaction
of your adrenal glands. This is because your adrenals (stress-regulating glands) support other glands, for example the thyroid. If your adrenals are burned out (because of consistent stress) it will affect your thyroid.

**Cause #4: High-carb diet**

If you consume a lot of carbs or you snack often, these can cause your body to produce insulin to lower the high amounts of blood sugar. Insulin is an inflammatory hormone, which means that the inflammation it creates can affect your thyroid, preventing it from working as it should.
