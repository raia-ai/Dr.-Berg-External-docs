# Is liver and gallbladder cleanse effective?

Bile, produced by the liver, is essential for extracting fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K1, K2) and preventing constipation. Liver damage, such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, or fatty liver, significantly impairs bile production and detoxification, causing toxin buildup.

Most liver and gallbladder cleanses are short-term solutions and do not address the underlying issues. The liver requires up to three years to regenerate fully. Effective long-term solutions involve dietary improvements and sustained lifestyle changes.
