# How can I manage estrogen dominance?

To help manage estrogen dominance, Dr. Berg recommends several natural strategies and supplements to help balance estrogen levels. Here's a summary of his recommendations:

1. **Cruciferous Vegetables**: Incorporating cruciferous vegetables like kale, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts into your diet is beneficial. These vegetables contain compounds that help balance estrogen levels.

2. **DIM Supplement Estrogen Balance**: Dr. Berg recommends the DIM Supplement Estrogen Balance supplement. DIM (Diindolylmethane) is a compound derived from cruciferous vegetables that supports healthy estrogen metabolism and helps balance estrogen levels in the body.

3. **Iodine Supplementation**: Iodine is essential for maintaining a healthy thyroid, which plays a crucial role in hormone regulation, including estrogen. Dr. Berg mentions getting iodine from sea kelp as a natural way to supplement iodine.

4. **Nettle Root**: Nettle root is highlighted as a natural aromatase inhibitor. Aromatase is an enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen. By inhibiting this enzyme, nettle root can help lower estrogen levels.

5. **Organic Meat**: It is recommended that you consume meat from grass-fed animals to avoid GMOs from corn and soy feed, which can influence estrogen levels.

These recommendations aim to support the body's natural hormone balance, reduce high estrogen levels, and address symptoms of estrogen dominance. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement or dietary regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions.
