# Are diuretics helpful for high blood pressure?

The most common treatment for high blood pressure is diuretics. But, diuretics can cause you to lose both sodium and potassium.  People who are salt sensitive or who have symptoms of a sodium deficiency are really deficient in potassium.

Sodium and potassium work together in the body, and you need twice as much potassium as you do sodium. The average person needs 2300mg of sodium and 4700mg of potassium per day.
