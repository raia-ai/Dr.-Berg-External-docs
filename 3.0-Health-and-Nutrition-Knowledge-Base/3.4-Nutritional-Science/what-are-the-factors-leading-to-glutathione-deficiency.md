# What are the factors leading to glutathione deficiency?

### **Factors Leading to Reduced Glutathione Levels**

There are many different factors that can contribute to low glutathione levels, including:

- Chronic stress

- Poor diet (low in precursor nutrients like glycine and cysteine)

- Environmental toxins and pollutants

- Certain medications (like acetaminophen and some antibiotics)

- Chronic infections and illness

- Genetic variations (like MTHFR mutations)

- Aging

Some lifestyle factors, like smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and lack of exercise, can also deplete glutathione levels over time.

The good news is that there are many ways to naturally boost glutathione production and recycling in the body, even if you have genetic variations or other risk factors.
