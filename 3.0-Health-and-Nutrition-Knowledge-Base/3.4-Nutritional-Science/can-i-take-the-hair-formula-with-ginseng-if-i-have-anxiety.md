# Can I take the Hair Formula with ginseng if I have anxiety?

The use of red ginseng, as found in Dr. Berg's Hair Formula, generally includes benefits such as exhibiting therapeutic potential for hair growth and preventing hair loss.  However, it's important to consider individual responses to supplements, especially for those with anxiety issues.

Red ginseng has been noted for its potential to increase energy and reduce fatigue, which might be beneficial for some individuals with anxiety by enhancing their overall resilience. However, because it can also stimulate the body, it might exacerbate anxiety symptoms in some people.

If you have anxiety and are considering taking a supplement that includes red ginseng, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider. They can provide personalized advice based on your health history and current condition. This is especially important as the effects can vary widely between individuals, and professional guidance is essential to ensure safety and efficacy.
