# What kind of fat is dangerous?

In this video, I'll share strategies to lose belly fat by targeting visceral fat, the harmful type stored around your organs.

**Understanding Fat Storage:**

Your body stores fat as a survival mechanism, but there's a limit. Excess fat, especially from unhealthy calories like alcohol and processed foods, accumulates around organs as visceral fat. If not addressed, it spills into organs as ectopic fat. The good news? This is the first fat burned when you lose weight.

**Causes of Excess Visceral Fat:**

- **Unhealthy calories:** Alcohol, high fructose corn syrup, and processed foods are major culprits.

- **Chronic stress:** Stress can trigger your body to turn substances into sugar, leading to fat storage.

- **Poor sleep:** Lack of sleep raises cortisol levels, contributing to visceral fat.

- **Certain medications:** Steroids, antibiotics, antidepressants, and anti-anxiety drugs can increase visceral fat.

- **Unhealthy fats and sugars:** Seed oils, refined sugars, and starches harm your mitochondria and promote visceral fat storage.

**Effective Strategies to Reduce Visceral Fat:**

- **Eliminate ultra-processed foods:** Focus on nutrient-dense options like red meat, eggs, fish, and vegetables.

- **HIIT exercise:** Short bursts of intense exercise followed by rest are highly effective for fat burning.

- **Weight training:** Build muscle to boost metabolism and burn more calories at rest.

- **Long walks:** Reduce stress and burn calories simultaneously.

- **Optimize nutrition:**

    - **Vitamin B1:** Found in nutritional yeast, it helps reduce stress and improve sleep.

    - **Vitamin D3:** Take 10,000 IU daily (with magnesium) if you lack sun exposure.

- **Consider fasting:** Fasting can help reduce insulin spikes and promote fat burning.

By understanding the causes of visceral fat and implementing these strategies, you can effectively reduce belly fat, improve your health, and achieve your weight loss goals.
