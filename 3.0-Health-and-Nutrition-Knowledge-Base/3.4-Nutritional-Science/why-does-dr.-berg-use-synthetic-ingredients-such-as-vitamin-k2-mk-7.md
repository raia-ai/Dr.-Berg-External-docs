# Why does Dr. Berg use synthetic ingredients such as Vitamin K2 (MK-7)?

**Why Are Synthetic Ingredients Used in Dr. Berg’s Products?**

In the world of supplements, natural isn’t always better, and synthetic doesn’t mean unsafe or inferior. Synthetic ingredients are often chosen because they’re the only way to deliver precise, powerful, and proven results. Here’s why certain synthetic ingredients are used in Dr. Berg’s formulas:

**Vitamin K2 (MK-7, Trans Form)**

Bioactive and Stable: Synthetic MK-7 gives you the trans form—the biologically active version your body needs. Natural sources can contain unwanted cis forms that aren’t as effective.

Longer Shelf Life: Unlike fermented food sources (like natto), synthetic MK-7 is more stable and lasts longer, maintaining potency until you need it.

Pure and Precise: Every batch is carefully crafted to deliver the same clean, pure form—without the variability found in natural extracts.

Bottom Line: For precision, purity, and power, synthetic MK-7 ensures your body gets the exact form it can use—every time.
