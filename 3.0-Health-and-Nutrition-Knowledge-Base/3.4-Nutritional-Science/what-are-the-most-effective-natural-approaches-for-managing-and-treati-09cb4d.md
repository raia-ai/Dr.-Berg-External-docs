# What are the most effective natural approaches for managing and treating autoimmune diseases?

An autoimmune disorder can occur when your immune system starts attacking healthy cells, and it can lead to a lot of damage and inflammation. Many autoimmune disorders start in the gut. Your body has protective mechanisms to keep pathogens from invading the gut. But, pathogens may be allowed to pass through the intestinal barrier if you have intestinal permeability, also known as leaky gut. This can lead to someone developing an autoimmune disease.

There is a certain protein called zonulin that regulates intestinal permeability, and it’s typically elevated in autoimmune diseases or inflammatory diseases. To find the best foods for autoimmune diseases, we need to look for foods that strengthen the intestinal barrier and keep zonulin in check. The number one thing that helps regulate zonulin is your own microbiome—it's crucial to support your microbiome.
