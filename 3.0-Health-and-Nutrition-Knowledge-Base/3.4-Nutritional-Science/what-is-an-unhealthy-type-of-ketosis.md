# What is an unhealthy type of Ketosis?

The classical ketogenic diet, an unhealthy form of ketosis, is primarily used for children with epilepsy to help reduce seizures. While it effectively induces ketosis, it offers limited nutritional value as it focuses more on inducing ketone production rather than providing a balanced diet. This diet often includes margarine, GMO oils, maltodextrin, soy, and synthetic vitamins.

Critics of ketosis sometimes highlight potential risks, such as kidney stones, elevated uric acid levels, and bad breath, using the classical ketogenic diet as an example. In contrast, a healthy ketogenic diet offers numerous benefits beyond managing epilepsy and is fundamentally different from the classical ketogenic diet.
