# Is Magnesium Powder chelated?

Our Magnesium Powder is chelated for better absorption. Chelated magnesium is created by binding magnesium to organic compounds, like amino acids or citric acid, through chelation. The word "chelate" comes from the Greek word for "claw".  In our Magnesium Powder product, the magnesium is bound to glycine.

Chelated magnesium may require more mixing to dissolve the bonded mineral. Start with a small amount of hot water to help it dissolve, then add more water to reach your desired consistency.
