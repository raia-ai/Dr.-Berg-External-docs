# Is it possible to experience pain or discomfort during a liver cleanse, and what are the potential causes and considerations for managing such symptoms?

Yes, pain can be associated with a liver cleanse due to the release of toxins, which can trigger inflammation and immune reactions, often manifesting as lower back pain. To mitigate this, consider taking bentonite clay or activated charcoal to absorb the toxins. If pain persists, increase your intake of vitamin D3 to 20,000 IU, which can be effective in alleviating discomfort.
