# Do you have vertical ridges on your fingernails?

Vertical ridges on nails are typically caused by one of 3 nutrient deficiencies:

1\. Iron deficiency

2\. Zinc deficiency

3\. Biotin deficiency

To determine which nutrient deficiency is causing the vertical ridges on your nails, first, look at your other symptoms. If you have an iron deficiency, you may also experience heavy menstruation and symptoms of anemia. Some people have a genetic problem that causes too much iron. Even with too much iron, you can become anemic because the iron in your body is dysfunctional. Liver problems and blood tests pinpointing a problem with iron could mean your nail ridges are caused by an iron deficiency. Cravings for ice or dirt and feeling cold with cold feet and hands can also signify iron deficiency.
