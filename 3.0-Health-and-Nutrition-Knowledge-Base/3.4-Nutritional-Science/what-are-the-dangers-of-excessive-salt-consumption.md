# What are the dangers of excessive salt consumption?

Signs of consuming too much salt include:

\- Edema (swelling in eyes, hands, feet, or legs)

\- Thirst

\- High blood pressure

\- Headache

\- Restlessness

\- Irritability

\- Nausea

\- Fatigue

Signs of sodium deficiency include:

\- Weakness

\- Low blood pressure

\- Increased neurotransmitters

\- Vascular stiffness and high blood pressure

\- Insulin resistance

Insulin resistance often causes high blood pressure, influenced by factors like a high-carb diet or intermittent fasting. Diuretics, commonly used for hypertension, may lead to sodium and potassium loss. For those with sodium sensitivity or signs of deficiency, ensuring adequate potassium intake is crucial, alongside a balanced mineral intake. Sea salts like Baja Gold Sea Salt offer a comprehensive mineral profile, including lower sodium content.
