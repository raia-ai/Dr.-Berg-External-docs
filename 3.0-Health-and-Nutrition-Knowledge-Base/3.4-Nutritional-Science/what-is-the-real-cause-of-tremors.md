# What is the real cause of tremors?

There is a high correlation between mitochondrial diseases and movement disorders. The nervous system requires a tremendous amount of energy, so it also requires very healthy mitochondria. When someone has a neurodegenerative disease, they usually have dysfunction in the mitochondria. Vitamin B2 and coenzyme Q10 are essential for FAD, which is vital for turning food into energy. Vitamin B2 also helps support the myelin sheath of your neurons. People who are deficient in vitamin B2 sometimes have neurodegenerative problems, neuropathologies, and swelling in the nervous system. Vitamin B2 acts as a precursor to help protect the mitochondria and help correct tremors. Coenzyme Q10 plays a similar role, helping to transport electrons from food so they can be converted into ATP, which provides cells with energy. If you take statins, you could become deficient in coenzyme Q10. This can cause all sorts of neurological and muscular symptoms, including tremors, which are a side effect of statins.

If you have tremors, consider taking 800 mg of B2 daily, split into two portions, 400 mg in the morning and 400 mg before bed. Also, try taking 1000 mg of coenzyme Q10â€”500 mg in the morning and 500 mg in the afternoon.
