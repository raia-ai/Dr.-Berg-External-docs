# What is Telogen Effluvium?

Telogen effluvium is a reversible condition in which hair falls out after a stressful experience. The stress triggers many hair follicles to enter a resting phase, causing the affected hairs to fall out within a few months. Common triggers for this type of hair loss include surgery, childbirth, and severe illness, with the primary symptom being hair loss. In many cases, no treatment is necessary, and the hair often grows back once the underlying stress is resolved.

Long walks are a great way to relieve stress. If possible, walking in nature without the distraction of technology or music will help promote the most stress relief benefits.

While Dr. Berg Nutritionals cannot diagnose, treat, or cure telogen effluvium, we can offer general guidance for best practices for healthy hair growth.
Focusing on nutritional intake and lifestyle adjustments is essential to promote hair growth effectively. Here are some key strategies:

1. **Nutrient Intake**:

    - **Iron-Rich Foods**: Consuming foods high in iron can combat anemia, a common cause of hair thinning. Include red meat, lamb, and other iron-rich foods in your diet.

    - **Vitamin C**: Essential for collagen production, which is crucial for hair structure. Found in leafy greens and other vegetables.

    - **Trace Minerals**: Important for protein synthesis and hair growth. Ensure adequate intake of trace minerals.

    - **B Vitamins**: Particularly biotin, which supports hair health. Nutritional yeast is a good source.

    - **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Reduce inflammation and support healthy hair growth. Sources include fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts.

2. **Lifestyle Adjustments**:

    - **Regular Exercise**: Improves blood flow and oxygen delivery to the scalp, supporting hair follicle health.

    - **Stress Management**: High stress can impact hair health, so incorporating stress-relief techniques like meditation or yoga can be beneficial.

    - **Proper Scalp Care**: Using gentle, sulfate-free shampoos and avoiding harsh chemicals helps maintain scalp health and supports hair growth.

3. **Hormonal Balance**:

    - **Balancing Diet**: Include foods that help regulate hormones, such as cruciferous vegetables and adaptogenic herbs like ashwagandha and maca.
