# What is the role of carbohydrates in cholesterol production?

While it’s true that excessive saturated fat intake can elevate cholesterol levels, it’s equally important to recognize the significant role carbohydrates—especially sugars, bread, and pasta—play in fat and cholesterol production.

**Understanding De Novo Lipogenesis:**

\- **Carbohydrate Conversion:** When consumed in excess, carbohydrates are converted into fatty acids through a process called de novo lipogenesis. These fatty acids are stored as triglycerides and can increase LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels, contributing to plaque buildup in the arteries and raising the risk of heart disease.

**Impact of Processed Carbohydrates:**

\- **Insulin Resistance:** Processed carbohydrates, like those in white bread, pasta, and sugary snacks, cause rapid blood sugar spikes. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance, a precursor to type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

\- **Cholesterol Production:** The liver converts excess glucose into very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), which eventually becomes LDL cholesterol, further contributing to arterial plaque and cardiovascular risk.

By moderating carbohydrate intake, particularly processed carbs, you can better manage cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.
