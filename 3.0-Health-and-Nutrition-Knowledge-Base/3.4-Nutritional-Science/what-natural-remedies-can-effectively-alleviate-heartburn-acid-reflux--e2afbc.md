# What natural remedies can effectively alleviate heartburn, acid reflux, or GERD without the use of medication?

**We're told that the cause of acid reflux, heartburn, and GERD is too much acid. But, I've found that rather than the overproduction of acid, these issues are typically caused by an underproduction of acid.** Two main conditions cause low stomach acid: hypochlorhydria and achlorhydria. Symptoms of both these conditions include acid reflux, heartburn, and GERD. Hydrochloric acid is there to help you break down food, absorb minerals and vitamins, and protect against pathogens. A deficiency in hydrochloric acid can lead to a myriad of health concerns. One of the side effects of antacids or other acid-suppressing medications is a loss of stomach acid. This can temporarily cause someone to feel better but can lead to other health issues.

**Top causes of low stomach acid:**

• Hypothyroidism

• Poor diet

• A suppressed immune system

• Antacids

• Low-salt diets

• Potassium deficiency

• Zinc deficiency

• Iodine deficiency

• Eating too frequently

**Betaine hydrochloride** is the best natural remedy for heartburn, GERD, and acid reflux. However, you shouldn't take it if you have an ulcer, and don't take betaine hydrochloride on an empty stomach. Consuming the Healthy Keto diet® and doing intermittent fasting may also be beneficial.
