# What are amino acids, and what is their significance in biological processes?

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Amino acids come in chains, which make up different types of proteins.

When you consume protein, your body breaks it down using acid and enzymes. This turns them into small amino acid particles.

Once your digestive system has broken down the proteins into amino acids, your body uses them to create many types of structures, including:

• Genes

• Blood

• Tissue

• Muscles

• Collagen

• Neurotransmitters

• Hormones

• Skin

• Hair

• Organs

• Enzymes

• Antibodies

There are simple proteins that are made from a handful of amino acids, and there are complex proteins that are made up of thousands of amino acids. Certain genes will act as "instructions" for assembling these amino acids into various structures.

Amino acids are needed to make over 50,000 different combinations. Amino acids are different from proteins and fats because they have an extra nitrogen molecule connected to them. This allows them to build and repair tissue. When you’re under stress, you need more amino acids to repair stress-related damage., Amino acids control your hunger, mood, emotions, sleep quality, and much, much more. There are essential amino acids and non-essential amino acids. Essential amino acids are ones that your body can’t create on its own—you must get these from your diet.

Eggs are the best source of amino acids. 3 to 6 ounces of protein per meal is optimal for your amino acid intake.
