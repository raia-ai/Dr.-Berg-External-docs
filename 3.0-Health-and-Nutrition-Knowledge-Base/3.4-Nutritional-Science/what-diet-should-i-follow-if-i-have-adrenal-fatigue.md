# What diet should I follow if I have adrenal fatigue?

The adrenal fatigue diet focuses on nourishing the adrenal glands to support their function and help manage stress. It emphasizes whole, unprocessed foods rich in essential nutrients like vitamin B1, vitamin C, magnesium, and potassium. Key components include plenty of fresh vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Foods like avocados, nuts, seeds, and leafy greens are particularly beneficial. Reducing or eliminating refined sugars, caffeine, alcohol, and processed foods is also crucial. This diet aims to stabilize blood sugar levels, reduce inflammation, and promote overall adrenal health.
