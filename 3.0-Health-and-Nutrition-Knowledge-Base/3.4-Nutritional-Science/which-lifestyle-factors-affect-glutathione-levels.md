# Which lifestyle factors affect glutathione levels?

### **Lifestyle Factors Influencing Glutathione Levels**

In addition to diet, several lifestyle factors can impact glutathione levels for better or worse. Some of the most important include:

- Sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night to support glutathione production and recycling.

- Exercise: Regular physical activity can help boost glutathione levels, but be careful not to overdo it, as excessive exercise can deplete glutathione.

- Stress management: Chronic stress is a major driver of oxidative stress and can quickly deplete glutathione levels. Incorporate stress-reducing practices like meditation, deep breathing, and spending time in nature.

- Avoiding toxins: Minimize your exposure to environmental toxins like air pollution, pesticides, and heavy metals, which can all deplete glutathione.
