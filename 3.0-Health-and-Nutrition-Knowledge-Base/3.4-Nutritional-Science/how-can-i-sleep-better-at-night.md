# How can I sleep better at night?

Cortisol should be at its lowest point at 2 a.m., but for some, it’s at its highest! This can cause night waking and other sleep problems that can really interfere with your day. Sleep medication can worsen this problem by causing your cortisol to rise even more.

Magnesium glycinate before bed can help lower cortisol, which can help you sleep better at night. Twitching and cramping can signify a magnesium deficiency.

Low blood sugar can increase cortisol and cause you to wake up at night. If your diet is high in carbs, your blood sugar may decrease while sleeping, and your body will increase cortisol levels to normalize your blood sugar. If you’re waking up at 2 a.m., evaluate what you ate the day before.

Refined starches, MSG, alcohol, snacking, and eating late can disturb sleep.

Salt cravings can signify a sodium deficiency. Sodium helps lower cortisol, so add more sea salt to your meals throughout the day if you’re having salt cravings.

The liver detoxifies the body between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. Night waking during this time frame could signify a problem with the liver. Milk thistle before bed can help.

Restless legs syndrome can be related to a B1 or magnesium deficiency.

Lower your carb intake and increase your consumption of these nutrients. A high pulse rate could signify a potassium deficiency, which can also interfere with sleep.

Apple cider vinegar before bed can help stabilize blood sugar for better sleep, but make sure it’s diluted.
