# What are the potential health risks associated with low cholesterol levels, and how can they affect overall well-being?

Cholesterol is often misunderstood as solely harmful, but it serves crucial roles in the body:

1\. **Recycling**: About 90% of cholesterol in the body is recycled, highlighting its essential nature.

2\. **Hormone Precursor**: It is a precursor for sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen, vital for hormonal balance.

3\. **Protective Role**: Cholesterol acts as a repair substance for damaged arterial walls, crucial in response to inflammation.

4\. **Daily Production**: The body produces approximately 2000 mg of cholesterol daily, underscoring its physiological necessity.

5\. **Metabolic Link to Sugar**: Excess sugar can convert to cholesterol and contribute to inflammation, emphasizing dietary impacts.

6\. **Role of Bile**: Bile aids in cholesterol breakdown, illustrating its regulated metabolic processing.
