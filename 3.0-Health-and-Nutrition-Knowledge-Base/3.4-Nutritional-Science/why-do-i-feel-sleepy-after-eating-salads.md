# Why do I feel sleepy after eating salads?

## **Post-Meal Fatigue from Salads**

**Feeling tired after a salad? Here's why:**

Gut Bacteria and Fiber:

\- Salads are high in fiber.

\- Gut bacteria ferment fiber, producing short-chain fatty acids.

\- This process can signal the brain to slow down, causing fatigue.

\- Too much fiber too quickly can overwhelm your digestive system, leading to bloating and tiredness.

**Misconceptions:**

\- Potassium: Essential for health, not likely to cause drowsiness in salad amounts.

\- Hidden Sugars: Usually not enough in salads to cause an energy crash.

**Main Point:**

\- High fiber in salads can lead to post-meal fatigue due to digestion.
