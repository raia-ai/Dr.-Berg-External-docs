# What are the vitamin deficiencies that can cause depression?

Vitamin deficiencies that may cause depression:

1\. Vitamin B12

The best forms of vitamin B12:

• Methylcobalamin

• Hydroxy B12

2\. Folate (vitamin B9)

The best form of folate:

• Methylfolate

3\. Vitamin D3

4\. Vitamin B1 (thiamine)

5\. Zinc

Try taking vitamin B12 and folate together and see if that gives you relief. If it doesn’t, you could move on to the other vitamins. It’s a good idea to try taking the last three vitamins one at a time, with a few days in between, rather than all at once. This way, you have a better idea of which one you could be deficient in.
