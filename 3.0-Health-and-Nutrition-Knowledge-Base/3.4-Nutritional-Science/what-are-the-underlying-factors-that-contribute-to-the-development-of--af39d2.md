# What are the underlying factors that contribute to the development of depression?

There is no evidence that depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain involving serotonin. It has been found that SSRIs can temporarily help increase serotonin in the brain. However, drug trials have shown that these anti-depressants were almost indistinguishable from the placebo in treating depression. SSRIs come with a lot of side effects, including some serious ones involving the sex organs. Does depression cause body problems, or do body problems cause depression? While it may be a mixture, weâ€™re going to focus on the body problems and deficiencies that could cause depression.

Potential causes of depression include:

1\. Insomnia

2\. Chronic fatigue

3\. Stress

4\. Nutritional deficiencies (vitamin D, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, magnesium, DHA)

5\. Lack of exercise
