# What is a good alternative to cheese if Iâ€™m allergic to dairy?

You could either be sensitive to the lactose, the milk, sugar which is probably not the problem. It could be the casein in there. But you may be allergic. Get a test but let's say you're not allergic and you're still reacting.

The type of the cheese matters. For example, if you get European cheese that is usually raw. You can get real raw European cheese and you probably get in America. You have to search it out.
