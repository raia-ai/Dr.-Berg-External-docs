### **Symptoms That Signal a Deficiency**

So, what are the red flags to watch out for? Here are some of the most common symptoms of essential fatty acid deficiency:

- Bumps on the back of your arms (not the cute kind)

- Dry, scaly skin that just won't quit

- Hair loss and changes in hair color (and not in a fun, experimental way)

- Vision problems (and not because you've been staring at your phone too long)

- Mood issues (because who needs stable emotions anyway?)

- Cognitive function problems (wait, what were we talking about?)

If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, it's time to examine your diet more closely and make some changes.

### **The Role of Dietary Sources**

So, what should you be eating to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency? Here are some of the best dietary sources:

- Eggs (the incredible, edible kind)

- Fish (but not the kind that sings "Under the Sea")

- Olives (and not just in your martini)

- Nuts (but not the kind that drives you crazy)

- Seeds (the kind you eat, not the kind you plant)

Integrating these edibles into your meals will boost your intake of vital fatty acids crucial for optimal bodily performance.

But what happens if you're eating all the right foods and still experiencing deficiency symptoms? That's where absorption issues come into play.
