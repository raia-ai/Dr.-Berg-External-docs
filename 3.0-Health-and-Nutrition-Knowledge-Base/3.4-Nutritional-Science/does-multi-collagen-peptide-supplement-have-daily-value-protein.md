# Does Multi Collagen Peptide supplement have daily value protein?

Multi Collagen Protein does not have a (%DV) daily value for protein for the following reasons:

- This is because collagen peptides do not have all the amino acids to create a complete protein. Therefore, we are not able to list a daily value.  Tryptophan is the missing amino acid from all collagen peptides, not just our product.

- The amino acid profile listed on the packaging is a General/Typical Amino Acid Profile.  Each batch will not have the exact amount of amino acids and will not be listed on a Certificate of Analysis.  These amounts have been tested from the initial batch, and subsequent batches will have a similar but not exact profile.

Below is information on the type I, II, III, V, and X collagen peptides in our product.
**Type I Collagen**
  •  Most abundant type in the human body
  •  Supports skin, teeth, bones, tendons and ligaments
  •  Provides strength to connective tissues
**Type II Collagen**
  •  Makes up about 90% of cartilage collagen
  •  Primary benefit is joint health and support
  •  Particularly beneficial for active people who need joint support
**Type III Collagen**
  •  Found in internal organs, blood vessels, and muscles
  •  Usually occurs alongside Type I collagen
  •  Present in bone marrow and reticular fibers
  •  Important for organ and vessel health
**Type V Collagen**
  •  Found in skin, nails, hair, and multiple organs, including cornea, bone matrix, muscles, lungs, liver, and placenta
  •  Supports eye health and development, particularly the cornea
  •  Plays a crucial role in placenta formation during pregnancy
  •  Coats the area around hair follicles
  •  Supports insulin production through Islet cell function
**Type X Collagen**
  •  Specialized collagen found primarily in bones and joint cartilage
  •  Essential for bone formation and mineralization
  •  Acts as a reliable marker for new bone formation in articular cartilage
  •  Particularly important during:
              \*Bone and cartilage healing after injury
              \*Early childhood growth phases
              \*Endochondral ossification (bone formation process)
