# What benefits might come from recognizing and managing delirium, given its indication of underlying medical issues?

There are other causes of emotional instability that have nothing to do with nutrition as well. But, I want to talk about the nutrient connection to your emotions. I believe the best vitamin for emotional instability may be vitamin B1. 

If you’re deficient in vitamin B1, you could experience emotional instability and delirium. Delirium is mental confusion and emotional disruption. Delirium can also often occur when an alcoholic or drug addict is going through withdrawal symptoms. 

**There are certain specific parts of the brain that require B1:**

• The hippocampus 

• The Amygdala

• The mammillary bodies

The RDAs for vitamin B1 is only 2mg. Vitamin B1 is water-soluble, so you don’t store a lot of it. You’re body only needs a small amount of it, but it needs it consistently. You will need more vitamin B1 if you consume carbs. The more carbohydrates or sugar you consume, the more vitamin B1 you’ll need.

**Things that can deplete vitamin B1:**

• Glucose 

• Stress

• Chlorine 

• Refined foods

**Other vitamin B1 deficiency symptoms:**

1\. Irritability 

2\. Depression 

3\. Anxiety 

4\. Confusion

5\. Memory loss

6\. Lack of initiative 

7\. Poor learning 

8\. Poor concentration 

The best source of vitamin B1 is nutritional yeast. If you’re going to buy a vitamin B1 supplement, a natural version over a synthetic version may be the best way to go. But, unfortified or unenriched nutritional yeast should have enough vitamin B1.
