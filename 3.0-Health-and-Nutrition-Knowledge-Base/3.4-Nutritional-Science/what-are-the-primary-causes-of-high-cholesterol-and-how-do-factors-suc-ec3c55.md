# What are the primary causes of high cholesterol, and how do factors such as diet, genetics, and lifestyle choices contribute to this condition?

Cholesterol is vital for brain function, hormone production, and cell health, acting as a repair substance in arteries damaged by inflammation. Factors influencing cholesterol levels include diet, bile production, thyroid function, and various health conditions:

\- **High-Carb Diet:** Increases insulin production, converting blood sugar into cholesterol. Remedies include the Healthy KetoÂ® diet and intermittent fasting.

\- **Lack of Bile:** Impairs fat absorption and cholesterol elimination. Remedies include apple cider vinegar and purified bile salts.

\- **Hypothyroidism:** Low thyroid function can elevate cholesterol levels. Remedies include consuming sea kelp and selenium-rich foods.

Other factors like intestinal damage, antibiotic use, and certain health conditions can also affect cholesterol levels. Managing these factors is crucial for maintaining optimal cholesterol levels and overall health.
