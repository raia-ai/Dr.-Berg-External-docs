# What are some tips to make my grocery shopping experience better?

Supermarkets employ clever tactics to influence your spending and control your shopping experience. Surprisingly, most of their profits aren't from product markups but from "slotting fees" paid by food companies for prime shelf space.

These companies vie for the "golden zone" at eye level, which can boost sales by up to 8 times. Supermarkets also manipulate store layout, scents, and even floor texture to slow you down and encourage impulse buys.

Other tricks include placing high-priced items near low-priced ones, using color psychology, and employing social proof tactics like "best seller" labels. The cereal aisle, often strategically placed, is a major profit center.

Additionally, 16% of sales occur at the front of the store, where tempting treats like candy are strategically placed. Labels can be deceptive too, with "natural" or "organic" not necessarily meaning healthy.

To outsmart these tactics:

- Avoid shopping with kids or when hungry/tired.

- Make a list and stick to it.

- Shop the perimeter of the store where fresh produce is typically located.

- Steer clear of junk food aisles.

By being aware of these tactics, you can take control of your shopping experience and make healthier choices.
