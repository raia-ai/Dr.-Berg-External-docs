# What is Betaine HCL, and what are its benefits for digestive health and overall well-being?

**Betaine hydrochloride is an amino acid.** It’s found naturally in certain foods including beets, spinach, beef, and shrimp. Betaine hydrochloride is an important natural remedy if you have SIBO (small intestine bacterial overgrowth), because one of the functions of a strong acid is to prevent pathogens from moving from the stomach into your small intestine then multiplying out of control. **Betaine hydrochloride is meant to increase your stomach acid; in other words, to lower your pH.** Your stomach acid should be between 1.5 and 3, which is highly acidic. This will help with the absorption of vitamin B12, minerals, trace minerals, and protein. It activates protease, an enzyme that helps break down protein into amino acids. If your body can’t properly break down protein, it’s left partially undigested, which creates a big problem.

**The remedy of betaine hydrochloride is excellent for GERD and acid reflux.** **Be sure to not take calcium at the same time as betaine hydrochloride, because the calcium will neutralize the acid. I recommend taking betaine hydrochloride before each meal. You may need as much as 5 or 6 tablets before you start eating. It may take some time for it to help your body make more acid. Antibiotics and antacids tend to destroy your stomach acid, making you more dependent on these medications. Take betaine hydrochloride to help.**
