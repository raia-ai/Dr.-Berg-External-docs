# Does the consumption of water play a role in the formation of kidney stones?

The most common type of kidney stone is calcium oxalate. Consuming calcium helps prevent stones by binding with oxalates in the digestive system, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream and accumulation in the kidneys. Drinking mineral water does not cause kidney stones.

**Foods high in oxalates:**

\- Almonds

\- Spinach

\- Kiwi

\- Beets

\- Chocolate

**Recommendations:**

\- Avoid high-oxalate foods if prone to stones

\- Consume calcium with oxalate-rich foods

\- Prefer calcium citrate, magnesium, orotate, or lactate over calcium carbonate

\- Maintain adequate fluid intake (at least 2.5 liters daily)
