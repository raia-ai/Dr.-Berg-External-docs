# What is L. reuteri?

Rats given L. reuteri stayed young, active, and slender, and their fur remained thick and healthy as they aged. Their immune systems were amplified, and wound healing time was cut in half. Increased testosterone and growth hormone were observed in elderly mice, and the thymus was restored to its original size. Dr. Davis has seen all of these amazing benefits in humans! Many people are missing this microbe! L. reuteri, like other Lactobacillus species, are very susceptible to antibiotics. Dr. Davis estimates that 96% of the population is missing L. reuteri, a major factor in the SIBO epidemic.

L. reuteri is a keystone microbe, which is important for the entire body’s ecosystem. It’s been found to increase the hormone oxytocin, traditionally regarded as the hormone of love and empathy. Oxytocin also influences body composition.
