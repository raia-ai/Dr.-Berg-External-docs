# What are the key signs and symptoms associated with thiamine deficiency?

Vitamin B1, crucial for mitochondrial function, is vital for energy production. Deficiency symptoms include low energy, influenced by carbohydrate and sugar consumption since B1 is necessary for glucose metabolism. It's water-soluble and not stored long-term, increasing risk of deficiency.

B1 also supports the myelin sheath and autonomic nervous system, impacting conditions like gastroparesis, GERD, and peripheral neuropathy. Symptoms range from irregular sweating and tears to dizziness, irritability, and increased pulse rate.

Severe deficiencies may lead to enlarged heart, edema, confusion, memory loss, and other neurological issues like nystagmus and ataxia, highlighting B1's critical role in overall health.
