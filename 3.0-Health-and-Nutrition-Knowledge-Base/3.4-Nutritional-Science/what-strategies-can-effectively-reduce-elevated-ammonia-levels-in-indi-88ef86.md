# What strategies can effectively reduce elevated ammonia levels in individuals with liver cirrhosis?

Ammonia is a byproduct of protein metabolism. Normally, in the digestive tract you break down protein from the stomach that turns into amino acids that are supposed to go through the liver and there are certain byproducts that occur with those amino acids; ammonia and urea. Urea is the less toxic form of ammonia.
