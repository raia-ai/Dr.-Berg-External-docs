# What are the nutritional benefits of broccoli sprouts?

Broccoli sprouts have more sulforaphane than any other food on the planet.

Sulforaphane is one of the most studied phytonutrients. It has many health benefits. Most of all, it inhibits breast and prostate cancer and tumors. Sulforaphane is actually a defense mechanism of plants. If a bug or microbe begins to eat the plant, the sulforaphane can kill it.

In the human body, it can actually detoxify carcinogens, which are things that cause cancer. It’s also a powerful antioxidant, which may help decrease your risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, and autism.

Some people do have a sensitivity to plant foods that have high levels of sulforaphane—so if you notice adverse effects, don’t continue eating broccoli sprouts. However, most of the population won’t have a problem with them. One drawback is that broccoli sprouts can deplete your iodine. However, you can take some sea kelp to counter this effect.

I recommend that you consume broccoli sprouts raw—they have ten times the amount of sulforaphane raw.
