# What sardines can I eat on keto?

Always check the package to make sure that your sardines are in olive oil or water. Soybean oil is full of omega-6 fatty acids. This can nullify the benefits of the omega-3 fatty acids naturally found in sardines.

Soybean oil is the most used oil in America today. It’s also the second most used oil in the world.

Soybean oil is used in everything from fast food to animal feed to canned foods.

Research shows that soy oil can induce obesity and diabetes more than fructose. Soybean oil can also contribute to insulin resistance and fatty liver disease.

Soybean oil affects the hypothalamus, reduces oxytocin and influences over 100 genes in the brain.

Because soybean oil is so heavily processed, it acts as a powerful oxidizer, it is estrogenic, and it can induce inflammation–especially in your arteries.

If all of that isn’t bad enough, soybeans are also GMOs. This means they are exposed to the chemical glyphosate.

In summary, make sure that your sardines do not contain soybean oil. Instead, choose sardines in water or olive oil.
