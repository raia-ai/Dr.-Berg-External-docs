# How does synthetic vitamin B12 compare to its natural counterparts in terms of efficacy and absorption?

Cyanocobalamin is a synthetic version of vitamin B12. It's a very cheap version, and it's hiding in many fortified grain foods, synthetic vitamins, energy drinks, B12 injections, and even infant formulas. It's also typically present in very high doses in these products. The problem is that there is a cyanide molecule attached to the cobalamin. Cyanide shuts down the oxygen to your mitochondria.

**Potential side effects of cyanocobalamin:**

• Vomiting

• Stomach problems

• Low potassium

• Headaches

• Fever

• Dizziness

The best form of vitamin B12 is the natural version called methylcobalamin. This version is the active form of vitamin B12 and stays in the body longer than the synthetic versions.

**Potential benefits of methylcobalamin:**

• It may help improve sleep

• It can decrease the need for sleep

• It can help you wake up feeling alert and refreshed

• It can help you fall asleep faster

• It's great for the nervous system (especially the myelin sheath)

• It supports healthy eyes

• It increases melatonin

• It decreases homocysteine
