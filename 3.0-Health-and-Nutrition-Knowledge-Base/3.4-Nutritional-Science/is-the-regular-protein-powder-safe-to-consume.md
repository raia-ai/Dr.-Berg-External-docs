# Is the regular protein powder safe to consume?

Maltodextrin, a common ingredient in many protein powders and processed foods, poses several health risks. It has been linked to acne, bloating, gut inflammation, irritability, anxiety, and insomnia due to its addictive nature and impact on dopamine levels.

Moreover, maltodextrin promotes tooth decay, spikes blood sugar more than sugar, and contributes to belly fat, high cholesterol, fatty liver, and other health issues with repeated consumption.

Derived from inedible dent corn through a chemical process, maltodextrin acts as a filler in various products. Classified as a carbohydrate, it functions as a sugar in the body, with a glycemic index exceeding that of glucose and table sugar.

Many protein powders contain a high proportion of maltodextrin compared to protein, leading to excessive carbohydrate intake and increased nutrient requirements.

Ultra-processed foods like maltodextrin trigger oxidation and inflammation, causing significant insulin and blood sugar spikes. This can result in fatigue, low blood sugar, and cravings, perpetuating a cycle that may lead to insulin resistance.

For optimal muscle building, focus on exercise and protein intake rather than consuming high amounts of refined sugar like maltodextrin.
