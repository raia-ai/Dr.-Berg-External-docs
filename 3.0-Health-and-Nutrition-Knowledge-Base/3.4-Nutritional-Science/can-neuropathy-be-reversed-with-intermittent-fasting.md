# Can neuropathy be reversed with intermittent fasting?

Neuropathy may be reversible with intermittent fasting, though it also depends on your diet when you're not fasting. Intermittent fasting is a powerful tool for addressing issues related to glucose and insulin, as fasting naturally reduces sugar intake. This reduction can significantly benefit the nervous system and help alleviate conditions associated with diabetes.
