# How does magnesium intake affect sleep?

Magnesium Deficiency and its Effects:

- **Magnesium controls sodium:** Magnesium helps regulate sodium levels in the body.

- **Sodium deficiency & cortisol:** Low sodium can trigger an increase in cortisol (stress hormone), affecting sleep and overall adrenal health.

- **Salt for sleep:** Consuming a bit more salt, particularly sea salt, in the evening can help regulate cortisol, promoting better sleep.

- **Healthy salt intake:** Choose whole foods like tomatoes with a sprinkle of salt, or even just a small amount of sea salt with water, rather than processed snacks high in unhealthy sodium.

**Key takeaway:** Magnesium deficiency can indirectly affect cortisol levels by impacting sodium regulation. Adequate salt intake, especially in the evening, can help improve sleep and adrenal function. However, it's important to focus on healthy sources of salt and avoid processed foods.
