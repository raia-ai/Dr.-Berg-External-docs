# What are the nutritional benefits of green coffee?

Green coffee beans are just coffee beans that have yet to be roasted. The coffee beans that we usually see are actually green seeds that have been dried and roasted.

Many people use roasted coffee grounds to make a facial mask. And it works. But Dr. Berg has found something even better: green coffee powder, made from unroasted coffee beans (called green coffee).

**Benefit**

Supports the health of the skin when applied to the skin directly.

**How to consume it**

Mix one tablespoon of green coffee powder with one tablespoon of water. Apply it to your face and let it dry for 15 minutes, then wash it off.

The phytochemicals that this will put onto your face will give it a healthy glow. If your skin is extra dry, substitute 1 tablespoon of olive oil for the water. Leave it on for 20 minutes, then wipe it off.
