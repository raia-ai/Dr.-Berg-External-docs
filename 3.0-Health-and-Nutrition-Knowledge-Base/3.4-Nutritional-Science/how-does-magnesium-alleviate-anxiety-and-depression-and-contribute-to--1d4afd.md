# How does magnesium alleviate anxiety and depression, and contribute to emotional well-being?

Magnesium plays a crucial role in mental health by regulating neurotransmitters such as GABA and serotonin, which impact mood and neurological health.  

Magnesium is also a natural relaxant that calms the nervous system, mitigates the effect of stress on the body, and promotes healthy sleeping patterns, which are essential aspects for managing symptoms of anxiety and depression.
