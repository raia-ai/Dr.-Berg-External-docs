# Why does the Friendly Bacteria Probiotic taste different from batch to batch?

It is common and normal for liquid probiotic products like our Friendly Bacteria Probiotic, which are naturally fermented, to have flavor variations from batch to batch. A slightly different flavor from batch to batch is often a sign that the product is a natural, living fermented food, not an indication of poor quality. As long as it's within its best-by date and has been stored correctly, this variation is normal.
