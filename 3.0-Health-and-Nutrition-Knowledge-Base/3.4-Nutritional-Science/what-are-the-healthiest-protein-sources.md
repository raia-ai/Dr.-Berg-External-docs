# What are the healthiest protein sources?

**Healthiest Protein Sources**

1\. **Red Meat**: A complete protein providing all essential amino acids. Opt for grass-fed to avoid antibiotics and hormones.

2\. **Poultry**: Choose organic, free-range to avoid risks associated with conventional practices, such as arsenic and formaldehyde.

3\. **Organic Eggs**: Prefer organic, pasture-raised eggs for higher nutrition and vitamin K2, indicated by bright orange yolks.

4\. **Fish**: Wild-caught fish, such as salmon and sardines, offer lower mercury levels and higher omega-3 fatty acids compared to farm-raised varieties.
