# Can excessive calcium intake lead to kidney stones?

Studies show that taking around 500mg of calcium carbonate will increase your risk of developing kidney stones. Massive doses of vitamin D over many months can also cause hypercalcemia, which can contribute to kidney stones. However, neither of these are the primary causes of kidney stones.

**The most common reasons for kidney stones are:**

1\. Kidney damage - years of bad dieting can cause poor kidney function. Try a healthy keto diet.

2\. Excess oxalates - avoid oxalate-rich foods, including almonds, spinach, swiss chard, and chocolate.

3\. Low citrates - take citrates or lemon juice.

4\. Low fluid - stay hydrated! At least 2.5 liters each day.

5\. Poor microbiome - improve your microbiome with probiotics and prebiotics (fiber).

6\. Low bile - take purified bile salts if you have low bile or a missing gallbladder.
