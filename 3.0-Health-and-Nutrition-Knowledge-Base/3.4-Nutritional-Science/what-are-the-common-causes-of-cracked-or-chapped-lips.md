# What are the common causes of cracked or chapped lips?

What’s causing cracked lips or chapped lips is really a vitamin B2 and B3 deficiency.  What can create a deficiency in vitamin B2 and vitamin B3? Consuming too many refined-flour products is a really big cause. I’m talking about foods like bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, and waffles. 

**More potential causes behind cracked lips:**

• Zinc deficiency 

• Vitamin A deficiency 

• Alcohol

**The best food that’s rich in vitamin B2 and vitamin B3:**

• Organic pasture-raised egg yolks
