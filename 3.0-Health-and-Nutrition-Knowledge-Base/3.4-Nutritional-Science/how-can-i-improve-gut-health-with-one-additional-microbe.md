# How can I improve gut health with one additional microbe?

## The Gut-Brain Connection and the Power of L. reuteri

Did you know that your gut and brain are in constant communication? The vagus nerve acts as a direct link between these two vital systems, influencing both your mental and physical well-being.

**The Gut-Brain Axis:**

- **A two-way street:** Just as anxiety and depression can disrupt your gut microbiome (the community of bacteria living in your digestive tract), an imbalance in your gut can trigger or worsen mood disorders.

- **Good bacteria are key:** A healthy microbiome strengthens your gut lining, aids digestion, and keeps harmful bacteria at bay.

- **Modern life can take a toll:** Factors like antibiotics, pesticides (such as glyphosate), processed foods, stress, alcohol, and pollution can damage your gut microbiome. This can lead to:

    - Reduced neurotransmitter production

    - Blood sugar imbalances

    - "Leaky gut" (increased intestinal permeability)

    - Inflammation

    - Allergies

    - Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)

**Harnessing the Power of L. reuteri:**

Dr. William Davis, inspired by the research of Dr. Irina Conboy, has developed a simple protocol for cultivating a powerful probiotic: **L. reuteri.** Studies in rats have shown that this beneficial bacteria can:

- Boost the immune system

- Enhance muscle tone and healing

- Exhibit anti-cancer properties

- Improve coat condition

- Increase mating behavior

Remarkably, these benefits extend to humans as well!

**DIY Probiotic Yogurt:**

Here's how to make your own L. reuteri yogurt:

1. **Create a paste:** Combine one L. reuteri probiotic tablet, inulin prebiotic fiber, and 2 tablespoons of organic half-and-half.

2. **Mix thoroughly:** Add a quart of organic half-and-half to the paste and mix well.

3. **Incubate:** Pour the mixture into a yogurt maker and incubate at 99 degrees Fahrenheit for 36 hours.

4. **Enjoy!** Consume half a cup of this probiotic-rich yogurt daily to support your gut health and overall well-being.
