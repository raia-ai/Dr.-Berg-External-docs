# How do you manage GERD symptoms if you don’t have a gallbladder?

GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) can persist after gallbladder removal due to issues with the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) valve. Here’s a professional approach to alleviate symptoms:

1\. **Enhance Stomach Acid**: Betaine hydrochloride (HCl) supplements can help acidify the stomach, prompting the LES valve to close properly. Begin with three capsules before meals and gradually increase to find the optimal dosage that reduces reflux.

2\. **Adjust Dosage**: Increase betaine HCl intake daily until symptoms improve. This may require adjusting the dosage up to nine or ten capsules per meal initially, maintaining this regimen for several weeks to assess effectiveness.

By addressing stomach acidity with betaine HCl supplementation, you can potentially improve LES function and alleviate GERD symptoms, despite not having a gallbladder. Always consult with a healthcare provider to tailor the approach to your specific health needs.
