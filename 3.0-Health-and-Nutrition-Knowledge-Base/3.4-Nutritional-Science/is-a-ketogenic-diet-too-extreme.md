# Is a Ketogenic Diet too extreme?

That belief comes from two different concepts. One is the sentiment, “Everything in moderation”. The other is, “There’s no good or bad food, just molecules. You just have to balance your foods”.

Let’s take a look at keto. You’ll eat moderate protein, higher fats, and low-carb foods. You need to lower your carbs to 20-50 grams per day. This is what people consider extreme.

But let’s compare keto to the standard American diet! It’s about 350 grams of carbs per day, which has become our new normal. But this is what’s extreme! Our society consumes pounds of sugar each year. Keto only sounds extreme if you don’t understand dietary sugar and blood sugar. When you get your blood glucose tested, you want it to be about 80 mg/dL. That equates to about one teaspoon of sugar in all of your blood. The average person consumes 28-30 teaspoons. That’s extreme!

What I consider extreme is the 4 billion prescriptions handed out each year in the US. The $3.4 trillion we spend on health care each year. And 60 percent of the US population is either pre-diabetic or diabetic. Keto is normal and reasonable and helps people get healthy.
