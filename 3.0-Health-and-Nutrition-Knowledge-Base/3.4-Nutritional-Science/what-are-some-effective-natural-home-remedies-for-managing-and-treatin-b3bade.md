# What are some effective natural home remedies for managing and treating tinea versicolor?

It looks similar to vitiligo but less intense. This fungus releases an acid that inhibits melanin, causing a loss of pigment. If you get it, you then have an 80% chance of getting it again.

**HOME REMEDY**

1\. Oregano oil

2\. Tea Tree Oil

3\. Thyme Oil

4\. Grapefruit Seed Oil

5\. Coconut Oil

Mix 4 drops of 1 or more of these oils in a tablespoon of coconut oil and mix - then apply it to your skin before bed. However, you need to work on your gut because ultimately, it's a loss of internal microbes that set you up for this condition. Antibiotics, cortisone treatments, being a diabetic, having PCOS, and even malnutrition can all set you up for getting this condition.
