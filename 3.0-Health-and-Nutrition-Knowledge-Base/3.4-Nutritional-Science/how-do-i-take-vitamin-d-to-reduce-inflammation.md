# How do I take vitamin D to reduce inflammation?

Vitamin D is a very powerful vitamin that supports and regulates your immune system as well as lowering inflammation. If you have chronic inflammation, this can be caused by vitamin D deficiency. The majority of the earthâ€™s population is deficient in vitamin D.

Additionally, if your chronic inflammation is caused by an autoimmune condition (your own immune cells are attacking your body itself) vitamin D can greatly help to restore normal functioning of the immune system as well as reduce the inflammation.

**Remedies:**

- Consume vitamin D

    - cod liver oil

    - expose your body more to sunlight

    - vitamin D supplement (at least 20,000 IU/day)

- You can take vitamin K2 along with D (helps to utilize free calcium in the body, helps with bone/joint inflammation) --100 mcg for every 10,000 IU of vitamin D
