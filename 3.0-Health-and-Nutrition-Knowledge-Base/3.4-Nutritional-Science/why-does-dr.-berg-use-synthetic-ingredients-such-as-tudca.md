# Why does Dr. Berg use synthetic ingredients such as TUDCA?

**Why Are Synthetic Ingredients Used in Dr. Berg’s Products?**

In the world of supplements, natural isn’t always better, and synthetic doesn’t mean unsafe or inferior. Synthetic ingredients are often chosen because they’re the only way to deliver precise, powerful, and proven results. Here’s why certain synthetic ingredients are used in Dr. Berg’s formulas:

**TUDCA (Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid)**

Cruelty-Free & Ethical: TUDCA was once extracted from bear bile. Today, it’s synthesized to protect wildlife and ensure ethical sourcing—no animals harmed.

Safe and Clean: Synthetic TUDCA is made in a lab to be free from pathogens and contaminants. It’s standardized and dosed exactly like the forms used in scientific studies.

Reliable Supply: Unlike animal-based sources, synthetic TUDCA is sustainable and scalable—so you get the same quality every time.

Bottom Line: Synthetic TUDCA is not only safer and more consistent—it aligns with modern standards of ethics, sustainability, and science-backed dosing.
