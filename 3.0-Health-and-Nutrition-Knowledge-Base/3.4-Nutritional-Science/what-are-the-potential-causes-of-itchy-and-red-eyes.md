# What are the potential causes of itchy and red eyes?

Having itchy, red eyes can create a number of difficulties in our daily lives. This condition can come from infections and allergies as well as nutritional deficiencies.

**Cause #1: Viral infection**

If you have an eye infection like pink eye, it can cause eye irritation, redness and inflammation. I suggest using colloidal silver as well as zinc and vitamin D to improve your immune system.

**Remedies:**

- Use 1 drop of colloidal silver in each eye 7 times per day

- Consume zinc

- Consume garlic

- Consume other natural antibiotics

Consume vitamin D

**Cause #2: Nutritional deficiencies**

There are several nutrients that your body needs for healthy functioning of the eyes. If you are deficient in them, this can create redness and irritation in the eyes.

\-If you are deficient in vitamin A, it can cause you to have dry eyes as well as a thickened mucus around the eyes that can result in itchiness and redness.

\-B vitamin deficiencies can cause redness or irritation in the eyes, especially B1 and B2 deficiencies.

\-Vitamin C helps keep veins and capillaries healthy and supports their work. If you have a small hemorrhage (bleeding) in the eye, vitamin C (along with vitamin K) can help repair it.

\-Vitamin D is one of the best nutritional anti-inflammatories; if you have red, irritated eyes, vitamin D can help resolve this condition.

**Remedies: Vitamin A:**

- Beef liver

- Egg yolks

- Cod liver oil

- Fatty fish

- Butter

- Cheese

    **B vitamins:**

- Nutritional yeast

- Eggs

- Meat

- Liver

- Fish

- Nuts

- Seeds

    **Vitamin C:**

- Sauerkraut

- Bell pepper

- Berries

- Raw lemons

    **Vitamin K:**

- Any type of dark leafy green

    **Vitamin D3:**

- Consume cod liver oil

- Get more exposure to the sun

- Take a vitamin D3 supplement

    **Improve the absorption of vitamins:**

- Consume apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water)

- Consume betaine hydrochloride

• Take purified bile salts

**Cause #3: Allergies**

An allergy is an intolerance to certain foods or some substance in the environment (like pollen). If you have red, itchy eyes, there is a possibility that you have an allergy and your eyes are reacting to certain substances or food.

**Remedies:**

- Consume vitamin A

- Consume vitamin D

- Locate the source of the allergy by looking back and seeing what you were exposed to or what you ate before the eye irritation started, then avoid it.

    **Cause #4: High-carb diet**

    When you are on a high-carb diet your blood sugars elevate too high after eating. As a result your tear glands can stop producing tears. Insulin can also affect the blood flow to the nerve that goes to the cornea. Additionally, if you feel that there is something in the eye but nothing is in there, this is a sign of a blood sugar / insulin problem.

    **Remedies:**

- Avoid sugar and refined carbs

- Avoid snacking

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

    **Other causes:**

- Blue lights causing irritation

- Lack of sleep

- Low blood sugar

- Anemia

- Lack of essential pancreatic enzymes

- Liver/gallbladder problem

- Alcohol

- IBS
