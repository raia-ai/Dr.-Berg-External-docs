**Why Choose Benfotiamine Over Allithiamine or Thiamine?** 

- **Choose Benfotiamine:** As a form of Vitamin B1, Benfotiamine supports the health and function of the nervous system. Its lipid-soluble nature allows it to be utilized effectively within nerve tissues, including penetrating the myelin sheath, which is crucial for normal nerve structure. It also contributes to normal cardiovascular function and energy production. 

- **Choose Allithiamine** As a naturally sourced form of Vitamin B1, Allithiamine contributes to meeting daily thiamine requirements. Adequate Vitamin B1 supports normal energy production, brain function, and the health of the nervous system. 

- **Choose Thiamine** if you need a basic, water-soluble form of Vitamin B1 for general supplementation. 

Ultimately, the choice depends on your specific health goals and needs. If you're unsure, consulting with a healthcare professional can help determine which form of Vitamin B1 is best for you.
