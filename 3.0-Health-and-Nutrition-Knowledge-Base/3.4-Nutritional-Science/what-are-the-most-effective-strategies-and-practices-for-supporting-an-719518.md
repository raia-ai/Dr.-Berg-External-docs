# What are the most effective strategies and practices for supporting and enhancing the health of your microbiome and overall gut health?

One of the benefits of fiber is that it feeds your microbiome. Your microbiome has many different functions, including fermentation. During the fermentation process, the microbes make small-chain fatty acids, vitamins, other acids, and secondary compounds that support the immune system.

But, if your microbes don't have access to fiber, they can consume other things. If someone is on a carnivore diet, their microbes can adapt to digest protein. You're not going to kill your microbes if you avoid plants. The important thing is to avoid grains. While some people have difficulty consuming any vegetables, other people may be able to consume fermented vegetables. This includes foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, and pickled vegetables.

Fermented vegetables have additional microbes that may help support your gut. They also have prebiotics, vitamins, and other health benefits.

**Tips to support your microbiome and overall gut health:**

1\. If you consume animal products, consume grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

2\. If you are vegan or vegetarian, don't consume grains.

3\. If you have severe gut problems, try a carnivore diet with grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

4\. If you have less severe problems with digestion, try consuming fermented vegetables along with grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

5\. If you don't have any digestive problems, try consuming a combination of plants (not grains) and grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.
