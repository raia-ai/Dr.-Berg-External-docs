# What methods can help relieve symptoms of premenopause and postmenopause?

With menopause, you experience a drop in both hormones. But because of the ratio of the two, it appears as though you have estrogen dominance when, in fact, you have an estrogen deficiency along with a progesterone deficiency. Itâ€™s just that progesterone has dropped more than estrogen.

Some of the symptoms you may experience before and after menopause are hot flashes, breast atrophy, vaginal dryness, and no periods (amenorrhea).
