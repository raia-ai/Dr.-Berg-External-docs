# What strategies and nutrients can help support bone health and strengthen weak bones?

If you have osteopenia or osteoporosis and you want to strengthen your bones, this video is for you.

The missing mineral that many people need to strengthen their bones is strontium. Strontium is a powerful trace mineral. Trace minerals are minerals you need in very small amounts. This is unlike calcium, which you need a lot of for strong bones.

You need strontium and calcium in a 1:1000 ratio.

**If you have a bone problem, strontium could be a powerful addition to your protocol along with:**

• Calcium

• Vitamin D3

• Vitamin K2

• Magnesium
