# Role of Vitamins and Minerals in Autism

### **Role of Vitamins and Minerals in Autism**

Vitamins A, E, and D, along with minerals such as [zinc](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-unexpected-amazing-benefits-of-zinc-that-you-ve-rarely-heard-about), [selenium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/12-amazing-benefits-of-selenium), and [magnesium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-benefits-of-magnesium), have pivotal roles to play in maintaining optimal brain function.

These nutrients help regulate neurotransmitters that affect mood and behavior—factors intrinsically linked to autism.

The lack thereof is frequently observed among those diagnosed with autism, leading to aggravated symptoms.

For instance, high homocysteine levels—a condition associated predominantly with vitamin B12 deficiency—can cause degenerative changes in the brain over time if left unchecked.

## **Dietary Recommendations for Individuals with Autism**

Adapting to a modified carnivore diet can help manage autism symptoms by eliminating potential allergens. It's essential, however, not to limit the food intake strictly to meat.
