# What are antioxidants and free radicals, and how do they interact within biological systems?

Atoms are composed of electrons, protons, and neutrons. Most atoms have paired electrons, but a free radical has unpaired electrons. This means that thereâ€™s an electron on one side, but not on the other side of the atom.

Free radicals cause damage to your cells in the DNA and the mitochondria because they cause oxidation.

**Sources of free radical damage include:**

Radiation

Chemicals

Hydrogen Peroxide

Free iron

Free copper

High amounts of sugar

In the body, iron and copper are usually bound to protein, but they wreak havoc when they are free.

So, what is an antioxidant? Antioxidants donate an electron to neutralize the damaging effects of free radicals.

**Antioxidants include:**

Vitamin C

Vitamin E

Alpha lipoic acid

Selenium compounds

Beta carotene

Coenzyme Q10

Antioxidant-rich foods include superfoods like leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables. Try avoiding the sources of free radical damage that cause oxidation, and focus on consuming foods high in antioxidants.
