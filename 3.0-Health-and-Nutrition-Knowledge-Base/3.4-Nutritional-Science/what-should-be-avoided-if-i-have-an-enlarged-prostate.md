# What should be avoided if I have an enlarged prostate?

If you have an enlarged prostate, it's advisable to avoid certain foods:

1\. **Dairy:** Dairy products like cheese, milk, yogurt, and butter can exacerbate prostate swelling due to their hormone content, particularly growth hormones.

2\. **Vegetable Oils:** Omega-6 rich oils found in salad dressings, such as corn, canola, and soy oil, are inflammatory. Opt for olive oil instead.

3\. **Sugar and Grains:** Sugars and foods that convert to sugar, like grains, bread, and pasta, should be limited to manage inflammation and hormone balance.

4\. **Soy:** Avoid soy products due to their estrogenic properties, which can impact prostate health negatively.

These dietary adjustments can help alleviate symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate.
