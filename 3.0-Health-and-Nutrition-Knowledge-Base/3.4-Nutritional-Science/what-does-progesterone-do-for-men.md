Cholesterol is the raw material for all steroid hormones in the body. Statins block cholesterol and can inhibit your ability to make important hormones, leading to hormonal imbalance. Sardines, organ meats, fatty meat, and whole milk cheese are the best sources of cholesterol. Cholesterol is turned into pregnenolone, a “happy” hormone that helps increase other hormones. Pregnenolone is the precursor to progesterone.
