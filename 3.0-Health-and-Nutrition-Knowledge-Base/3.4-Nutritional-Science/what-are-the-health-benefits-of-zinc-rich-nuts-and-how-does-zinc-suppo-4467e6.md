# What are the health benefits of zinc-rich nuts, and how does zinc support immune function, wound healing, and well-being?

Consuming foods high in zinc or zinc supplementation is necessary to ensure that you get your recommended daily value of zinc. Zinc has no storage system in the body, so you need to get it from your diet each day. Eating nuts that provide zinc can support your immune system, keep your skin healthy, and improve your vision at night.
