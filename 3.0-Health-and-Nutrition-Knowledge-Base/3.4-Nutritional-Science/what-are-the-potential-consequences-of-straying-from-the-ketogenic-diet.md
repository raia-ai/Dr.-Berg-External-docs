# What are the potential consequences of straying from the ketogenic diet?

When you have a cheat meal and you eat carbs, you spike insulin which then reacts to store glucose. You end up with a low blood sugar situation. This is when hunger sets in, the cravings start, and other negative effects like anxiety happen.

Cheating on keto can kick you out of fat burning for 1 to 3 days.

Of course, when you eat carbs you will feel better, but not for very long. Soon after the carbs, you’re left wanting more and more. By eating carbs you’re also depleting a lot of essential nutrients.

How to recover from a cheat day on keto:

- Drink apple cider vinegar with water

- Start fasting

- Exercise

- Take potassium and sodium

- Consume B vitamins
