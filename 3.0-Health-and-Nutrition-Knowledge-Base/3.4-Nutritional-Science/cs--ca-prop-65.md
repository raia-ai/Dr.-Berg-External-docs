# CS- CA Prop 65

Proposition 65, commonly referred to as *Prop 65*, is a California law officially known as the *Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986*. The purpose of this law is to protect California's drinking water sources from being contaminated with chemicals that are known to cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm. It also requires businesses to inform Californians about the presence of such chemicals in the products they purchase, their homes, or workplaces.

Key points about Prop 65:

1. **Warning Labels**: Products sold in California that contain chemicals on the state's list of harmful substances must display a clear warning label. This applies to a wide range of products, including foods, household items, and even furniture.

2. **Chemicals List**: The state of California maintains and regularly updates a list of chemicals that are known to cause cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm. This list includes hundreds of chemicals.

3. **Not a Ban**: Prop 65 does not ban the sale of products containing these chemicals, but it does mandate that businesses provide warnings to consumers if the levels of exposure to the listed chemicals exceed certain thresholds.

4. **Who Must Comply**: The law applies to all businesses operating in California, as well as those selling products that may be distributed or used in the state.

Warnings under Prop 65 often appear on products and packaging with the statement:
*"WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."*

It's important to note that the presence of a Prop 65 warning doesn’t necessarily mean a product is unsafe; it just indicates that it contains one of the many chemicals on California’s list and the exposure level may be significant.
