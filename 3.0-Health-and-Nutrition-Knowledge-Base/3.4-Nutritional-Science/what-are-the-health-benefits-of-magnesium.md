# What are the health benefits of magnesium?

Magnesium is a mineral that is very important for your nervous system and bones as well as your mood. People get magnesium from their diets, but sometimes magnesium supplements are needed if its levels are low. Of all the minerals, magnesium is the second most important, after potassium. You need both of these in pretty large quantities.

If you have low magnesium, you may have problems with bones and muscles like muscle cramps, muscle weakness, or muscle stiffness. Another key function of magnesium is maintaining electrical charge in the cells.
