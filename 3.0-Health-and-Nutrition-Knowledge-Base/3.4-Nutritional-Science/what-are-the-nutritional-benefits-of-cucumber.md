# What are the nutritional benefits of cucumber?

Cucumber is a keto-friendly vegetable that has high nutritional value. Cucumbers also have certain phytonutrients (healthy substances found in plants) that are also found in cruciferous vegetables.

**Benefits**

1. Can help stabilize blood sugars

2. Can help stabilize cholesterol

3. Has anti-inflammatory properties

4. Loaded with powerful antioxidants

5. Provides fiber to make butyrate (butyrate can help with insulin resistance)

**How to consume it**

You can consume it raw. If you want to get more benefit from cucumber’s phytonutrients you can ferment them (different from pickling), steam them (but don’t overcook them), and eat them with fat (for example, eat with hummus that is made with olive oils).

**Where to get it**

You can get it in a grocery store or a health food store. If you like pickles, buying fermented pickles is a better choice.
