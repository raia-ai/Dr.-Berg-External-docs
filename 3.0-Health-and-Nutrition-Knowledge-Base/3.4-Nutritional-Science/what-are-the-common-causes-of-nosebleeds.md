# What are the common causes of nosebleeds?

Nosebleeds can give a lot of concern if you donâ€™t know their cause and remedies. Consuming nutrients that support blood clotting can greatly help.

**Cause #1: Low vitamin K1**

Vitamin K1 is very important for your body. It has to do with blood clotting, and functions to stop you from bleeding. If you are deficient in K1, this can result in nosebleeds. Certain medications that have warfarin (chemical) can block vitamin K1.

**Cause #2: Sinus irritation**

Having an allergy, virus or infection can cause irritation of certain membranes (cell layers) in the sinus. This can cause bleeding from the nose.

**Cause #3: Low platelets**

Platelets are blood-clotters that flow through your blood. If you have a nutrient deficiency or some kind of liver disease, like cirrhosis or fatty liver, this condition can cause insufficient amounts of platelets to be produced by your body.
