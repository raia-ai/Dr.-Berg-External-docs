# Does fasting help with fear-related disorders?

**Fear is an emotion that helps us survive, but it’s not good when the body is in a chronic state of fear.** 

**I believe one of the most powerful things you can do is fasting. There are many different things fasting can do for the brain, immune system, and mood. It can potentially elevate your mood from a chronic state of anxiety or fear to a much higher state.** 

Fasting is a survival mechanism that helps you survive in times of danger and tends to counter the fear emotion. It supports the adrenal glands, a structure in the brain called the amygdala, and the sympathetic nervous system. 

The amygdala has a lot to do with fear. The sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) is located inside the adrenal glands and mid-back nerves. Some studies show that fasting may help the adrenal glands, amygdala, and sympathetic nervous system.
