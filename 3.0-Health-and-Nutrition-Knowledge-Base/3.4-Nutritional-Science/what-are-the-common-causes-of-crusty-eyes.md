# What are the common causes of crusty eyes?

Crusty eyes can indicate a vitamin A deficiency, particularly when there's dryness and thickened mucus. Vitamin A, found in animal products like eggs, beef liver, and cod liver oil, is crucial for eye health. Factors such as low iron, insufficient pancreatic enzymes, gallbladder issues, alcohol consumption, IBS, inflammation, and antibiotic use can hinder vitamin A absorption. Increasing intake from animal sources, like cod liver oil, can help alleviate crusty eyes, while addressing absorption issues is key for effective treatment.
