# Can a comprehensive liver detoxification significantly improve skin clarity, and what underlying mechanisms link liver health to skin appearance?

Yes, a liver detox can help achieve healthier-looking skin. Poor liver function can lead to a buildup of toxins and may increase the skinâ€™s detoxification burden, which can trigger inflammation, redness, and sensitive skin. Promoting healthy liver function improves toxin clearance, thereby reducing the risk of skin inflammation.
