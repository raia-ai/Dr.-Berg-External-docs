# Will avocados help me lose weight?

Avocados are high in calories, but there is no need to worry that you will gain weight. In fact, avocados contain avocatin B, a fat molecule that helps to shrink belly fat by stimulating your metabolism to burn fats.  

Avocados' high fat and fiber content promotes satiety and reduces hunger, helping with weight management and weight loss.
