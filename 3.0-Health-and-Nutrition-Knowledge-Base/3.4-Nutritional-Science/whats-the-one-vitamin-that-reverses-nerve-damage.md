# What's the one vitamin that reverses nerve damage?

Viruses can hide in the ganglia (a nerve cell cluster) and turn off autophagy, a state in which the body recycles damaged proteins. Here, the viruses can lie dormant until stress levels rise, which increases cortisol and weakens the immune system. Emotional stress can significantly weaken the immune system. This is why many dormant viruses come out of remission after a stressful event, such as losing a loved one.

The herpes and shingles viruses are often seen after a significant stressor. These viruses need the amino acid arginine to survive. Lysine can block arginine and stop the reproduction of these viruses. You need at least 1000 to 3000 mg of lysine to block arginine.

Sciatica typically stems from a disc problem. Copper deficiency is at the root of many disc problems, so it can be an excellent solution for sciatica. A copper supplement or copper cream can help reduce sciatica pain.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is usually caused by a vitamin B6 deficiency. Along with increasing vitamin B6, you also need more vitamin B12 to support the myelin sheaths of your nerves.

Adequate vitamin D3 is vital for conditions like multiple sclerosis and helps reduce inflammation within the nerve cells. To put conditions like MS into remission, you need to take large amounts of vitamin D3â€”at least 50,000 IU.

The Coimbra Protocol is a well-researched method of using high doses of vitamin D3 to effectively reduce the symptoms of autoimmune conditions. Many people with diabetes develop a condition called peripheral neuropathy that causes numbness in the toes and feet. Vitamin B1 in the form of benfotiamine can penetrate the myelin sheath and help reverse nerve damage caused by high blood sugar. For vitamin B1 to work, you need the cofactor magnesium.
