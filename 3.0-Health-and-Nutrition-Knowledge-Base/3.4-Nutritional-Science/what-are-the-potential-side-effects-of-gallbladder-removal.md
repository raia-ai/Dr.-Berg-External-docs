# What are the potential side effects of gallbladder removal?

**Some of the common symptoms associated with gallbladder removal include the following:**

• Constipation

• Diarrhea

• Anal leakage

• Fullness under the right rib cage

• Right shoulder pain

• Collins’ sign pain

You can live a long, healthy life without a gallbladder, but unfortunately, 40% of people who’ve had their gallbladder removed end up with persistent pain and symptoms for a year or more.

The gallbladder is an extension of the liver that holds and concentrates bile. Every time you eat, it contracts and releases bile into the small intestine. Bile begins to break down fat, allowing the pancreas to further break down fat by releasing an enzyme called lipase. Bile is critical for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, E, D, and K, as well as essential fatty acids. Bile also helps you get rid of excess cholesterol.
