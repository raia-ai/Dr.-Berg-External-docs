# Is whey protein healthy to consume?

Whey protein is a unique type of protein. It's one type of protein in the dairy. It's not casein. And a lot of people take it for bodybuilding and muscle repair and to replace the amino acids. If you look at the bioavailability, it's not on the top of the list. It's kind of lower. But it is very, very, very high on another scale called the insulin index. And those are all the â€“ they don't look for foods that spike your blood sugars like the glycemic index. They're looking for foods that will spike the actual insulin.

And that's what we're trying to really ultimately keep down. On one note, you're going to get a spike of insulin when you take whey. And that may not be a bad thing if you are trying to gain muscle or weight because you also at the same time spike the opposing hormone called glucagon. So it kind of does help to neutralize it to some degree. It's not like eating sugar. But you just have to experiment and see how well your body handles the whey protein. Because it's very low fat, it's a lean protein, that's why it spikes insulin a little bit more than other things, actually a lot more. You may want to try a protein or amino acid that has more fat or add fat with it. Some people do really good on it. A lot of the powders out there, they don't just have the whey protein. They have maltodextrin too.
