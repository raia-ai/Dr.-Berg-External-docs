# Does fasting affect growth hormone?

Growth hormone is naturally produced in the body and has many benefits, including boosting fat-burning, preserving and increasing muscle mass, boosting collagen (anti-aging), and increasing bone density. As you age, your body begins to produce less growth hormone.

Fasting can boost the production of growth hormone in your body, with a 2-day fast increasing levels by as much as 200% in the body. Adopting intermittent fasting will also boost growth hormone on a smaller scale, helping you preserve muscle mass better than a low-calorie diet can. The anti-aging effects of increasing growth hormone are a great reason to adopt intermittent fasting as an eating pattern.
