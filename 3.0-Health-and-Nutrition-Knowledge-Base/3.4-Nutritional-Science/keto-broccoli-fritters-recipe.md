# Keto Broccoli Fritters Recipe

These green broccoli fritters are really yummy. I recommend you serve them warm, with some sour cream or plain yogurt. The texture is great, and the flavor is subtle. Give them a try!  Here's how to make keto-friendly broccoli fritters at home:

**Ingredients:**

• 1 Cup steamed broccoli

• 2 Eggs

• 1/2 tsp curry powder

• ¼ tsp sea salt and pepper to taste

• Coconut oil 

• (may need a little coconut flour)

**Directions:**

• In a food processor, pulse the broccoli until finely ground. Pulse eggs, curry powder, salt, and pepper. The batter should be thick enough to hold a pancake shape in the pan. If it's too watery, add coconut flour (1 tsp) and blend again. Blend until thick and smooth. 

• Heat skillet to medium-high. I love cast iron. Always fully heat the cast iron first and add oil. Drop about 2 tbsp. of "batter" into the hot pan for each fritter. Brown on one side before turning. You can peek under to see if it's ready. Flip and brown the other side.

Enjoy!
