# What effective strategies and approaches can be employed to address feelings of weakness?

Weakness in simple words means lack of energy. Additional symptoms of weakness can include fatigue, feeling tired, etc. If you have any of the above symptoms, letâ€™s find and remedy the most common causes for weakness.

**Cause 1: High-carb diet**

When you are on a high-carb diet you may often feel weak and tired. The reason behind this is that when you consume carbs, your blood sugar goes high. Although you may feel energetic, the feeling will go away very fast. Your body will produce insulin, which in its turn will lower the blood sugar, causing you to crave food and feel weak.

Additionally, consuming sugar in general will instantly make your body weaker! You can watch this video and try the experiment.

**Cause 2: Stress**

If you have chronic stress, it can wear your body out. Lack of sleep or vitamin B1 deficiency can lead to poor tolerance of stress and the inability of stress-regulating organs to work properly. These can definitely cause weakness.
