# What are some quick methods to reduce acid reflux?

Heartburn is not a problem resulting from too much acid—it's a valve problem. Keeping the pH of the stomach between 1 and 3 keeps the valve shut.

**How to get rid of heartburn naturally:**

**1\. The most important nutrient to eliminate and prevent heartburn is vitamin B1 (thiamine).** Your stomach can not produce acid when you’re deficient in vitamin B1. A diet high in carbs depletes B1. Low B1 deprives the autonomic nervous system, which controls the valves of the stomach. Look for a natural source of vitamin B1 to get rid of heartburn.

**2\. Potassium and zinc are very important for your stomach acid.** Try a good electrolyte powder and trace mineral supplement to increase your intake of these important minerals. Also, make sure you’re getting plenty of sea salt.

**3\. Increase your stomach acid.** This triggers the valve at the top of the stomach to close. Apple cider vinegar and betaine hydrochloride can help acidify the stomach.

It’s important to note that if apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride causes burning, you may have gastritis or an ulcer. In this situation, you need to heal the stomach before taking apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride.
