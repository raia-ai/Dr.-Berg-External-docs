# Do I need a multivitamin supplement on Intermittent Fasting?

When you consume less frequent foods, growth hormone is elevated and this protects you from the loss of protein and helps you get into autophagy, which helps you recycle protein better.

Amino acids are easy to get even if you do one meal a day. Fatty acids are also easy to get on this plan, because your proteins normally already contain the fat. This will also supply the fat soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) and then we get to vitamins. Vitamins come in two categories, fat-soluble and water-soluble.

The water-soluble vitamins like C and B complex can be gotten from your vegetables and nutritional yeast. Your minerals can also be gotten from your vegetables, but trace minerals are difficult to get. You may want to take some extra sea kelp or seafood to get these.
