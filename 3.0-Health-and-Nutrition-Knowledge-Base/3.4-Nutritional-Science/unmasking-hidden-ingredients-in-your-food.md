# Unmasking Hidden Ingredients in Your Food

**Unmasking Hidden Ingredients in Your Food**

Did you know food manufacturers employ sneaky tactics to conceal what's really in your food?

- **The Rounding Rule:** If an ingredient is less than 500mg per serving, it might not even be listed! This means you could be consuming unwanted additives without even knowing it.

- **Sugar Overload:** There are over 200 different names for sugar, making it difficult to track your intake.

- **Incidental Additives:** These ingredients aren't for flavor, texture, or preservation, and if they make up less than 5% of the product, they can be hidden from the ingredient list. A common culprit is maltodextrin, a carbohydrate that acts like sugar in the body and has a higher glycemic index than table sugar.

- **Hidden Dangers:** Hexane, a neurotoxin, is used to extract soy protein isolates found in many plant-based products. Despite its dangers, there's no regulation on how much hexane can remain in your food.

**DIY Ingredient Detective:**

Want to uncover hidden starches? Add a couple of drops of iodine to a glass of water. If your food turns blue or purple when mixed in, it contains hidden starch!

It's time to become a savvy label reader and take control of what you consume.
