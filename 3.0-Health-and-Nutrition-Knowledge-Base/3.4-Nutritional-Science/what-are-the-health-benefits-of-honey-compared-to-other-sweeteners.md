# What are the health benefits of honey compared to other sweeteners?

Honey is a sweetener that contains a lot of good stuff. However, it still is 50% fructose and 50% glucose. This means it can slow down your weight loss, and it has a relatively high glycemic index.

**Raw honey benefits**

What you should know is that although honey has some nutrients, it is very high in fructose. Fructose puts stress on the liver and can create a lot of problems.

If you had to choose between honey and sugar, honey might be the better option because it has some antioxidants and some antimicrobial properties. But, overall, honey is low in actual nutrients. It may be better than refined sugar, but not by much.

**Where to get it**

You can get it in a regular grocery store. If you want to get benefits from honey, get a raw version of it, not pasteurized. Pasteurized honey is almost like pure sugar, and its potential health- boosting properties have been cooked away.

If you want to consume honey, you may want to try raw manuka honey. This type of raw honey is unprocessed, and it has a lot of great properties.
