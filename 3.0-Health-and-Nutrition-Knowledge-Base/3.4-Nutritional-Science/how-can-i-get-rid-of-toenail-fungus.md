# How can I get rid of toenail fungus?

Treating a fungal infection with medication can cause several side effects, including liver damage! Toenail fungus is often blamed on sweat and can cause other skin infections such as jock itch, athleteâ€™s foot, beard infections, and even scalp infections. When attempting to treat a fungal infection topically, the cream will not penetrate deep enough into the nail to kill the toenail fungus.

Toenail fungus can evade your immune system through several mechanisms, including growing slowly, suppressing T cells, and going dormant for long periods of time. The T. rubrum microbe that causes toenail fungus is resistant to UV radiation. When your T cells are healthy and active, it forces this microbe into remission. A cooler, dry environment can also put it into a dormant state. A change in environment, such as pH, temperature, or moisture, can bring it out of remission.

A suppressed immune system is the leading cause of a toenail fungal infection. Stress, diabetes, obesity, antibiotics, and a vitamin D deficiency can suppress your immune system and cause toenail fungus to come out of remission.

Vitamin D is the most important nutrient for your immune function. Your toenails contain vitamin D receptors, but toenail fungus can downgrade them. Toenail fungus prevention starts with a strong immune system and a hostile environment for toenail fungus. High amounts of vitamin D can help! Consider taking at least 25,000 IU of vitamin D daily to get rid of toenail fungus.

Vitamin D strengthens the immune system and addresses toenail fungus at the systemic level. Zinc pyrithione, breathable shoes, and proper foot hygiene can also aid in toenail fungus prevention.
