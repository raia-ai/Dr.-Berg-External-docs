# Is it safe to use a gallbladder cleanse?

A gallbladder cleanse is not advisable if you have potential gallstones. Gallstones are often caused by a bile deficiency. Since 90% of bile is recycled, a gallbladder flush can deplete your bile reserves, increasing the risk of stone formation. It can take a long time to restore bile levels, further raising the risk of complications.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**
