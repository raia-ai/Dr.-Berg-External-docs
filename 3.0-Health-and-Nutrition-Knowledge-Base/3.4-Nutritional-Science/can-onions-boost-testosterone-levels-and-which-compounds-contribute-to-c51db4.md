# Can onions boost testosterone levels, and which compounds contribute to this effect on hormone regulation?

Testosterone does a lot in the body, including increasing libido, controlling male characteristics, and increasing muscle growth. When someone takes testosterone, they inactivate the gland that makes the hormone. Generally, we want to choose natural ways to increase testosterone, which can involve natural glandular therapy. Onions are high in quercetin, which triggers the luteinizing hormone. Luteinizing hormone controls and can increase the production of testosterone in males.

**Onions also have a lot of additional health benefits:**

• They have powerful antioxidant effects

• They have properties that help with insulin resistance

• They have anti-cancer properties

• They can help increase nitric oxide to support the vascular system

• They may help reduce the risk of cataracts

• They may help reduce the risk of allergies

• They have potent anti-inflammatory properties

• They may help decrease blood pressure

• They can act as a diuretic

It’s best to consume raw onions to support healthy testosterone levels. However, you can sauté the onions or cook them—just be sure not to overcook them.
