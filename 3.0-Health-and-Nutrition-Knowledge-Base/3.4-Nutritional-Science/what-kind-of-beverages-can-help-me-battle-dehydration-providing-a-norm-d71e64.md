# What kind of beverages can help me battle dehydration providing a normal DV of electrolytes?

The best drink to avoid dehydration is electrolyte-enriched water. Electrolytes play a crucial role in facilitating fluid absorption into the body, and electrolyte imbalance can cause dehydration despite drinking plenty of fluids. 

However, itâ€™s best to avoid pre-mixed electrolyte sports drinks with added sugar and instead use a sugar-free electrolyte powder to replenish electrolytes and avoid dehydration.
