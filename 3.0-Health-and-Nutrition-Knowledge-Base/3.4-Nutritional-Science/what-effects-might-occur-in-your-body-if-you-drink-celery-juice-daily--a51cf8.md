# What effects might occur in your body if you drink celery juice daily for a week, and what potential benefits or changes could you expect?

Celery juice, composed of 95% water, offers minimal nutrients but contains four key phytonutrients with notable health benefits:

1\. **3-n-butylphthalide**: Aids in stroke recovery, enhances microcirculation, and exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-thrombotic properties.

2\. **Apigenin**: Found in parsley, onions, and thyme, it relaxes muscles, lowers blood pressure, improves sleep, has anti-diabetic effects, and may benefit those with amnesia.

3\. **Coumaric Acid**: Provides anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, and anti-clotting benefits, supports healthy blood sugar levels, and alleviates arthritis-related inflammation.

4\. **Kaempferol**: Demonstrates antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory effects.

For optimal benefits, consume celery juice in the morning on an empty stomach, using organic celery and adding lemon juice if desired.
