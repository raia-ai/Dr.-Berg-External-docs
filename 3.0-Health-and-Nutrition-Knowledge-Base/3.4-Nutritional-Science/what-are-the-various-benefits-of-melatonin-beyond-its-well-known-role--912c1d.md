**Melatonin: Way More Than Just Sleep!**

You probably know melatonin helps you sleep, but did you know it does a whole lot more? Let's dive in!

*Important Note:* I'm not saying you should take melatonin pills â€“ your body can make its own. Though levels do drop with age, you can boost them naturally. I'll share how later.

**Melatonin's Amazing Benefits**

1. Powerhouse Antioxidant: Fights damage that contributes to aging and disease.

2. Immune System Booster: Helps you fight off illness.

3. Inflammation Fighter: Can ease pain and promote healing.

4. Headache Helper: May reduce frequency and intensity.

5. Cancer Combatant: Research suggests a protective role.

6. Brain Protector: May guard against memory loss and Alzheimer's.

7. Lowers LH: This hormone is linked to Alzheimer's risk.

8. GERD Soother: Can reduce those uncomfortable acid reflux symptoms.

9. Anxiety Reducer: Promotes calm and relaxation.

10. Depression Fighter: Supports a positive mood.

11. Blood Sugar Stabilizer: Important for overall health and energy.

**How to Boost Your Melatonin Naturally**

- Lights Out at Night: Darkness signals your body to make melatonin.

- Soak Up the Sun: Daylight exposure is key for the sleep-wake cycle.

- Block Blue Light: Ditch screens close to bedtime, or use blue-light blocking glasses.

- Avoid Late-Night Snacks: Eating too late disrupts sleep patterns.

- Get Glucose in Check: A low-carb keto diet can help.

- No TV Before Bed: The flickering light messes with melatonin.

**Melatonin-Rich Foods:** Mushrooms, eggs, fish, and nuts are great sources!
