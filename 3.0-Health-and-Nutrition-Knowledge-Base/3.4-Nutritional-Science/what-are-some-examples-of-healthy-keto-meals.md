# What are some examples of healthy keto meals?

Dr. Eric Berg, the Knowledge DocTM shares with you his own keto eating and intermittent fasting routine. If you’re looking for a sample fasting and keto meal plan, or you’re wondering what to eat on keto, this keto-friendly plan is one that really works for him.

**Intermittent fasting routine:**

- I wake up at 5:00 am, and I go to bed at 10:30 p.m. (with intermittent fasting I need less sleep)

- I try to keep my meals within a 3 to 4 hour window so I have around 20 to 21 hours of fasting

- At 5 a.m. I have a small cup of organic coffee with grass-fed half-and-half or heavy cream and one packet of xylitol

- At 6 a.m. I’ll have around 12 to 16 ounces of water with 1 to 2 ounces of organic lemon juice, and take my vitamins

- I have my first meal between 1 and 3 p.m.

- I have my second meal between 5 and 6 p.m.

**Meal 1 example:**

- 4 pasture-raised organic eggs

- 4 oz of organic bacon

- 3 oz high-quality European organic grass-fed cheese (I like sheep cheese and goat cheese)

- 1⁄4 cup olives

- 1 tomato (in moderate amounts, tomatoes are OK on keto)

**Meal 2 example:**

- A big salad (7 to 10 cups): lettuce, bell pepper, tomato (moderate amounts), cabbage, kale, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, balsamic vinaigrette

- A protein (7 oz): sardines (with bones and skin), shrimp, grass-fed and grass-finished hot dogs, organic grass-fed and grass-finished burger, wild-caught salmon, or steak

- Nuts: pecans or pistachios
