# Is the powdered form of Vitamin D3 less effective than the liquid form of D3?

Both our dry and liquid D3 supplements are highly effective. D3 is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning it needs some fat for optimal absorption. Here's how we ensure you get the most out of our products:

- **Dry Formula:** Our capsules include MCT powder for fat-soluble support, plus ox bile for further absorption enhancement.

- **Liquid Formula:** We use MCT and fractionated coconut oil as carriers, avoiding inflammatory vegetable oils commonly found in other brands.

Both forms use the same true form of D3 (cholecalciferol).

**The Best Choice for You:** Individual needs may vary, so it's difficult to say whether dry or liquid is universally better. Our commitment to quality ingredients and thoughtful formulation sets us apart, regardless of the form you choose.
