# What are Dr. Berg's thoughts on products that are full of ketones?

There are products available that either convert to ketones, such as MCT oil, or contain exogenous ketones that can be consumed directly. These products range in price, with both premium and more affordable options on the market. While they may provide some benefits, particularly for individuals engaged in competitive exercise seeking additional energy, the overall enhancements in performance or well-being can be modest—primarily manifesting as improved mental clarity or energy.

In specific clinical scenarios, such as managing conditions like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, or dementia, the intake of ketone products can offer significant advantages. Ketones can serve as an alternative energy source for the brain, which may preferentially utilize ketones over glucose. This can be particularly beneficial for bypassing damaged neurons that struggle to metabolize glucose, thus potentially supporting cognitive function in affected individuals.

As with any supplement, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most suitable approach for your specific needs.
