# Are grass-fed meats healthier compared to conventionally raised meats?

Grass-fed means that animals were fed on grass. However, you should know that there is no legal definition for the word grass-fed. So you don’t know how long the animal was fed grass, in actuality. It could be several months, it could be a year, you don’t know. What is really important is that it says grass-finished. If it doesn’t say grass-finished, it means grain-finished, which has a difference in health benefits for the body. Ideally, you would want to have grass-fed, grass- finished, 100% certified organic food.
