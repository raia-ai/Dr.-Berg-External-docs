Stunted growth often stems from malnutrition. Zinc deficiency, for instance, can hinder growth by affecting hormone production. Issues with the pituitary gland, which regulates growth hormone, also impact height.

In children, growth hormone supports bone and muscle development, while in adults, it aids protein preservation, weight management, and anti-aging. Amino acids stimulate growth hormone production, but insufficient protein intake, high blood glucose, sugary diets, insulin resistance, and poor sleep can suppress it.

The liver produces insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), crucial for growth. Deficiencies in IGF-1, triggered by inadequate amino acids and zinc found in red meat, fish, and shellfish, can affect height. Diets high in phytic acid, common in regions like the Republic of the Congo (primarily rice, grains, corn, cereals), block zinc absorption, leading to deficiency and impacting immunity. Stress, sugar, and insulin resistance also contribute to zinc deficiency.

Vitamin D is vital for growth, but many are deficient due to reduced outdoor activity and excessive junk food consumption among children, compounded by gut inflammation hindering absorption.
