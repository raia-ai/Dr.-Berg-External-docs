# Which component of the lemon—such as the juice, pulp, zest, or seeds—contains the highest concentration of nutrients and health benefits?

The most nutritious part of a lemon is the rind and the white pith beneath it, which are rich in flavonoids and other beneficial compounds. For optimal nutrition, blend the entire lemon, including the rind and seeds, rather than just juicing it. This method significantly increases nutrient intake. You can enhance the flavor with a few drops of stevia or blueberries for a healthier alternative to sweetened lemonade.
