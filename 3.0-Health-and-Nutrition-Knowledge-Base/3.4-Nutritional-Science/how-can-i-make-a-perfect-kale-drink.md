# How can I make a perfect kale drink?

Creating a nutrient-rich kale superfood green juice is simple and rewarding. Start with a handful of fresh kale leaves, a cup of blueberries, and a cup of filtered water. Blueberries add antioxidants and a pleasant sweetness to balance kaleâ€™s natural bitterness.

For added sweetness and smoothness, blend in a ripe banana, which enhances texture and flavor. Incorporate a tablespoon of coconut oil for a creamy consistency and added healthy fats, which support brain function and provide an energy boost. This combination delivers a delicious, health-boosting drink.
