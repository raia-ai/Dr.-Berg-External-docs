**The Hidden Dangers in Your Food: 4 Ingredients to Watch Out For**

Most junk food is loaded with ingredients that can harm your health over time. Don't be fooled by fancy names on the label - learn to spot these common culprits:

- **Added Sugar:** It's not just about calories. Sugars like high fructose corn syrup are linked to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

- **Refined Starches:** These highly processed carbs spike your blood sugar and leave you feeling hungry again soon. Think white bread, pastries, and sugary cereals.

- **Inflammatory Oils:** Seed oils like soybean and corn oil are often chemically processed and can contribute to inflammation throughout the body.

- **Processed Proteins:** Soy protein isolates and certain dairy proteins can trigger inflammation in some people.

**Remember:**

- Read the ingredient list, not just the nutrition facts.

- Avoid products with long lists of unpronounceable ingredients.

- Choose whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible.
