# What is the best time of day to break a fast?

One of the biggest questions surrounding Intermittent Fasting is when to break the fast. However, the truth is that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.

The best time of day to break a fast is wholly based on an individual's schedule, lifestyle, and preferences. Some people prefer to break their fast in the morning, while others prefer to do so in the afternoon or evening. The timing of the feeding window will also depend on the length of the fast.

Certain feeding times may have greater results for some individuals, but this doesn't mean that it's the best time for everyone. So, the key to success with intermittent fasting is finding a feeding schedule that works for you and your lifestyle.

In this video, Dr. Berg presents evidence that feeding in the morning *may* promote positive results, but he acknowledges that the results may vary by individual. [https://youtu.be/GW3UMJOJs9E?si=bBa6Ty4bAzzvdOgy](https://youtu.be/GW3UMJOJs9E?si=bBa6Ty4bAzzvdOgy)

Ultimately, listen to your body, experiment with different feeding times, and find the one that works best for you. Remember, the most important thing is to make sure you're getting the nutrients your body needs to function properly, whether it's in the morning, afternoon, or evening.
