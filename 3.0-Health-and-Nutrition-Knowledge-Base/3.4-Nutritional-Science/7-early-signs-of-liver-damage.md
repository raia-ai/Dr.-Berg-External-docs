# 7 Early Signs of Liver Damage

**7 Surprising Signs of Liver Damage**

While alcoholic fatty liver disease is a concern, most liver issues stem from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Here are some unexpected signs to watch for:

1. **Bulging or Tightness Under the Right Rib Cage:** This can sometimes lead to right shoulder pain due to pressure on the phrenic nerve.

2. **Loss of Energy:** This differs from typical fatigue. You might experience decreased endurance, especially during exercise, tiredness after eating, or a need for early bedtimes.

3. **Itchiness:** Often worse at night, this itchiness, especially on the feet, is caused by bile salts building up in tissues due to liver problems.

4. **Red Dots or Spider Veins:** High estrogen levels due to liver damage can cause these skin changes. Men might also develop breast tissue, while women might experience symptoms of estrogen dominance.

5. **Thyroid Problems:** Liver issues can impact thyroid function, leading to symptoms like fatigue, hair loss, high cholesterol, and dry skin.

6. **Low Vitamin D:** Liver damage can exacerbate existing vitamin D deficiency. Look out for inflammation, weakened immunity, and muscle problems.

7. **Dark Urine:** Dark, strong-smelling urine can be a sign of liver problems.

**The Root Cause**

Whether it's a fatty liver, inflammation, or cirrhosis, the root cause of many liver problems is often the consumption of sugar, starches, and seed oils.

**The Solution**

Eliminating these culprits from your diet can potentially reverse fatty liver and improve other chronic health issues.
