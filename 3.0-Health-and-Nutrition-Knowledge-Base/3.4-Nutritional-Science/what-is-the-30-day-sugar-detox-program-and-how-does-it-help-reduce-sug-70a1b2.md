# What is the 30-Day Sugar Detox program, and how does it help reduce sugar intake and improve health?

What will happen if you cut sugar out of your diet for thirty days? Let’s talk about it.

Metabolic flexibility is a term used to describe how smoothly and efficiently your cells can adapt to utilize and burn fuel like fat, ketones, or glucose.

When you’re metabolically inflexible, this transition is very dysfunctional. Your ability to burn fat in a fasting state will be very difficult. If you can’t lose weight when fasting or exercising, this could be why.

Metabolic inflexibility can lead to diabetes, obesity, loss of muscle protein, and chronic illnesses. It can also cause irritability, fatigue, anxiety, and hunger. When you try to fast, you won’t feel very good, and you’ll miss out on certain benefits if you’re not metabolically flexible.

Insulin resistance is at the heart of this problem. Insulin controls whether you burn fat or not. If someone is metabolically inflexible, they have insulin resistance. Insulin tells the body not to burn fat and to store fat instead.

On the flip side, metabolic flexibility is really insulin sensitivity, and there are ways to make the body more metabolically flexible or insulin sensitive.

When you become more metabolically flexible, you’ll be able to fast for longer without hunger or cravings, burn fat, and burn sugar more efficiently.

How to transition your body into a state of metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity:

1\. Eat less frequently

2\. Eat fewer carbohydrates

3\. Eat sufficient amounts of fat, but not excessive amounts of fat

4\. Try exercise snacking (do short bouts of exercise throughout the day)
