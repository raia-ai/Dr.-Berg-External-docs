# Why do the Electrolytes all have different nutritional value?

We have 3 electrolyte products for 3 purposes.  

The Electrolyte Powder addresses potassium and magnesium deficiencies while also building up other electrolytes with the increased daily recommendation of 1 time per day.  

Sports Hydration Electrolytes is best for someone who is sweating a lot.  The higher sodium levels will help replenish the sodium lost through sweat.  

The Electrolyte Capsules are a great option for any who has sufficient and fairly balanced electrolyte levels and wants to maintain them.  They are also a good option for anyone who would prefer to avoid a flavored electrolyte and/or stevia.
