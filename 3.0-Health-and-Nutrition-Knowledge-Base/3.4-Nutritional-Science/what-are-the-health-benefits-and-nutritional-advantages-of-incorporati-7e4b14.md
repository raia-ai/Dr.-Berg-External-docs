# What are the health benefits and nutritional advantages of incorporating lemon into the diet?

Lemon is a fruit that has many different benefits for our bodies. It contains citric acid, which is a very strong type of acid. One interesting thing about lemon juice is that as soon as you consume it, it gets burned up in the body and turns alkaline.

It should be noted that it can help prevent uric acid stones, as well as help with acidosis. Lemon juice won’t alkalize the blood or body, but it will alkalize the urine.
