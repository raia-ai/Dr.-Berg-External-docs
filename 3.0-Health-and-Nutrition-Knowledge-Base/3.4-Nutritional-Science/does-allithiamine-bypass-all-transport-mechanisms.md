# Does Allithiamine bypass all transport mechanisms?

Allithiamine does not bypass all transport mechanisms. It is absorbed through a specialized entry mechanism, which means its absorption is rate-limited and not entirely passive. This indicates that while allithiamine may have a more accessible transport across the intestinal wall than free thiamine, it still relies on specific transport processes rather than completely bypassing them.
