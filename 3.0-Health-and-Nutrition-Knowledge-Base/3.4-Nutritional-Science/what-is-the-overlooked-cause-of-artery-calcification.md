# What is the overlooked cause of artery calcification?

Lactic acidosis occurs as a byproduct of glucose metabolism. Both lactic acidosis and lactate in the blood are associated with various health issues, including:

• Heart attacks

• Thrombosis

• Panic attacks

• Autonomic nervous system dysfunction

• Bipolar disorder

• Schizophrenia

• Sepsis

• Arrhythmia problems

• Liver disease

• Diabetes

• Cancer

• Restless leg syndrome

Calcification in the arteries is not just caused by old age, consuming too much calcium, or even a vitamin K2 deficiency. It turns out that one cause of vascular calcification is hypoxia in the arteries. Hypoxia is a lack of oxygen, and this lack of oxygen in the arteries can be caused by lactic acidosis.

**The top causes of lactic acidosis:**

• A high-carb diet

• An overactive sympathetic dominance situation (chronic stress)

• Metformin

• Warfarin

• Statins

• Alcohol

• Overtraining
