# Fatty Acid Deficiency - Despite Taking Essential Fatty Acids - EFA?

I heard from someone who had symptoms of an essential fatty acid deficiency, even though they were taking essential fatty acids (EFA). EFAs are omega 3 and omega 6. Here are the symptoms of a deficiency:

● Small red bumps on the back of your arms

● Dry, scaly skin

● Hair loss

● Loss of pigment in your hair

● Heart issues

● Vision problems

● Mood issues

● Problems with cognitive function

If you’re taking essential fatty acids and not seeing a change in your body, then you know you’re not absorbing them. Here are the potential reasons why:

● Pancreatic insufficiency

● Insufficient stomach acid

● Intestinal issues like irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn’s

● Gallbladder problems such as lack of gallbladder, or one that’s congested

● Liver issues such as fatty liver, hepatitis, or cirrhosis

The last two on this list are the most common reasons why someone isn’t properly absorbing essential fatty acids. If you have a big belly, chances are you have a fatty liver. An ultrasound can confirm. This results from insulin resistance, which itself is caused by consuming things like alcohol and refined sugars, and eating far too often. As well, if you have a fatty liver then chances are you have a congested gallbladder.

These are good sources of essential fatty acids:

● Eggs

● Fish

● Fish oil

● Olives and olive oil

● Vegetables

● Nuts

● Seeds

● Grass-fed animal products such as meat and cheese

I hope this answered the question about how you can develop an essential fatty acid deficiency!
