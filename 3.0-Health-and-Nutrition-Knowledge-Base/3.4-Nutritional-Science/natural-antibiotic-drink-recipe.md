# Natural Antibiotic Drink Recipe

The overuse of antibiotics is a major issue in the United States. Overuse of antibiotics leads to antibiotic resistance. This means that the microbes that are not killed by the antibiotics become stronger and resistant. When you take antibiotics again, they don’t work as well anymore.

Antibiotics do not kill yeast or viruses, but they do kill good microbes that keep the yeast at bay. This is why a common side effect of antibiotics is an overgrowth of candida or yeast.

Weaker antibiotics like penicillin and tetracycline work by slowing the growth of microbial reproduction. Stronger antibiotics like Cipro and Levaquin come with strong side effects and a black box warning.

If you have to take stronger antibiotics, always take magnesium, vitamin E, and probiotics along with them. After taking antibiotics, it could take weeks or even years to get your original microbes back. Because 80% of your immune system is your microbiome, this can have detrimental effects on your natural immunity.

Antibiotics naturally come from molds and other microorganisms found in the soil. These natural compounds have anti-inflammatory effects, antimicrobial effects, anti-diabetic effects, and anticancer effects.

**Here is the recipe for a natural antibiotic drink that should be taken at the first sign of a cough or illness:**

•3 cloves garlic

•90 drops Echinacea extract

•1 whole organic lemon (peel included)

•1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

•1 tablespoon raw honey

•16 ounces water

Blend all ingredients for about 45 seconds. Drink ⅓ of the mixture 3 times per day. If you’re in the middle of an infection, do this for the duration of the infection. You should notice a diminishing of symptoms, and you should sleep better. Also, take 50,000 IUs of vitamin D3 and 100 to 150 mg of zinc to boost your immune system.
