# What factors might contribute to feeling unwell even when consuming a healthy diet?

**99% of the time, this situation is related to digestion.** It’s possible there’s some type of low-grade inflammatory response going on in the digestive system—usually from food allergies.

It’s likely that food allergies are causing constant inflammation with the intestinal wall, which creates histamines. Histamines can produce flu-like symptoms, achiness, fatigue, and more.

It’s possible that allergies are due to a failure in the adrenal system. Allergies also mainly exist in people who have an overly alkaline body. It just so happens that people with an adrenal body type are also more alkaline. So, alkalosis could be a very big problem.

**What to do if you feel sick after eating healthy food:**

1\. Acidify the stomach (do this slowly over time with apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride)

2\. Take a high-quality probiotic (start out small and increase over time)

3\. Avoid allergies (keep track of what you react to)
