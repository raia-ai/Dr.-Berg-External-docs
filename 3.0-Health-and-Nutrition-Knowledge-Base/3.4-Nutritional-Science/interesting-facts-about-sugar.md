# Interesting Facts About Sugar

1\. It’s not just the amount of carbohydrates that matters. It’s also the quality of the carbs. You have to consume less than 50 grams of net carbs per day to get into ketosis. But, there is a big difference between consuming 50 grams of sugar carbs vs. 50 grams of carbs in general. For example, 50 grams of carbohydrates from sugar would be equivalent to a twelve-ounce orange soda. But 50 grams of net carbs from vegetables is equivalent to about 42 cups of salad.

2\. The liver treats fructose like alcohol. Most types of sugar are really fifty percent glucose and fifty percent fructose. When you check your blood sugar, you’re really only looking at the glucose. Fructose doesn’t affect the blood sugar by that much. Instead, it affects the liver. Even though fructose doesn’t raise your blood sugar levels, it can create other serious issues. These issues can include a fatty liver, high triglycerides, high cholesterol, free radical damage, inflammation, insulin resistance, and diabetes.

3\. Just because it’s from beets doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Most of the sugar used in the US is from beets and is genetically modified, so there are traces of glyphosate. There is an in-depth process to produce beet sugar, and the end product is refined and overly processed.

4\. The chemistry of glucose is similar to vitamin C. This means that glucose and vitamin C are competitive to a certain degree. If you consume sugar, your body won’t absorb vitamin C.
