# Does the FDA Regulate supplements?

Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA):

- **FDA does not approve supplements:** Unlike drugs, supplements do not require FDA approval before being marketed.

**Supplements**

- **Pre-market Approval:** The FDA does NOT have the authority to approve dietary supplements for safety and effectiveness before they are sold to the public.

- **Manufacturer Responsibility:** It is the responsibility of dietary supplement companies to ensure their products meet safety standards and are not otherwise in violation of the law.

- **Post-market Regulation:** The FDA's role in regulating supplements primarily begins after the product enters the marketplace. They periodically inspect manufacturing facilities, review product labels, and take action against any adulterated or misbranded dietary supplement product.
