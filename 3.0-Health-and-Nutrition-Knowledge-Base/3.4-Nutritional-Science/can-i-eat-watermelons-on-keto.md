# Can I eat watermelons on keto?

Yes, in small amounts.

There are two factors you need to know. One is the glycemic index, which is the speed at which your blood sugars are elevated after you eat the food item. The second is the glycemic load, which is a measurement of the quantity of carbohydrate in a given food.

A glycemic load of less than ten is on the low side. Watermelon is four, which is good. But its glycemic index is fairly high at 72. If you consume larger amounts of watermelon (or any food) the glycemic load multiplies. If you eat a small amount of watermelon on a keto diet, you’ll be okay as long as you keep within your net carbs.

If your metabolism is really slow, you want to avoid watermelon and even berries. But if your metabolism is good, you’ll be fine with a little bit of watermelon.
