**How to consume it**

Follow the directions on the label to consume the right dosage. You want to take EDTA on an empty stomach because if you consume it with food it will bind with the minerals in the food.

You also want to drink a little bit more water when you take EDTA, and take minerals and trace minerals to compensate for any loss of them. The cool thing is that you are taking out the bad minerals and you can just replace them with good ones.
