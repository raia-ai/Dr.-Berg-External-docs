# Should I quit consuming sugar?

Sugar consumption is linked to a host of negative health effects, including diabetes, asthma, depression, stroke, heart attack, gout, hypertension, dementia, cancer, and early death. Even individuals with a healthy weight can suffer from metabolic syndrome due to high sugar intake. Sugar, especially fructose, is deemed as toxic as alcohol, supporting harmful industries and harming the body. Transitioning to keto-friendly desserts and sugar-free chocolate can help reduce sugar intake and promote better health.
