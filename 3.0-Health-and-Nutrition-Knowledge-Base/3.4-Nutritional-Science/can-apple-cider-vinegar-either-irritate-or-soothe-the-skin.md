# Can apple cider vinegar either irritate or soothe the skin?

The pH of the skin is 5.5 (acidic) – 7 is neutral, below 7 is acidic, and higher than 7 is alkaline. The sweat and the oil(sebum) in the skin are between 4 – 5.5 acidic.

The pH of apple cider vinegar is between 2 to 3 and is 100x more acid than skin so yes it could irritate and burn the skin. Always dilute it and don’t put it directly on your skin.

Dilute 1 tbsp. in an 8oz of water.
