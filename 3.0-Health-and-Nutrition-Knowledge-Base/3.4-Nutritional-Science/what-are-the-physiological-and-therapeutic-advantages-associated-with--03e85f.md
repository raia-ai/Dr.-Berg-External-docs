# What are the physiological and therapeutic advantages associated with L-Carnitine supplementation?

L-carnitine is an amino acid that transports fat into the mitochondria. Mitochondrias are the energy factories in all of your cells. L-carnitine also handles some of the waste that’s generated from fat that’s being oxidized.

L-carnitine is not just for athletes or people who want to lose weight. The best way to use it is actually for your cardiovascular health. Essentially the heart loves fatty acids. It needs L-carnitine to transport fatty acids into the machinery to burn for its energy.
