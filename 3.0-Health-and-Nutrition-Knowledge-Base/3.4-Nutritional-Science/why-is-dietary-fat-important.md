# Why is dietary fat important?

There are several reasons why you need dietary fat for a keto diet.

- Fat helps you fast longer (lowers hunger and cravings)

- Fat supplies you with nutrients (essential fats and fat-soluble vitamins)

- Fat stimulates bile

- Fat triggers healthy hormones

- Fat supplies your body with healthy tissue

- Fat slows the absorption of protein

- Fat helps you maintain your weight

The truth is, you don’t necessarily need to consume more fat on keto. Most of all, you need to lower your carbohydrates. Carbs affect insulin, and insulin blocks ketosis. The key is to lower your carbs.

Ketosis is also not a high-protein diet. You want to consume only a moderate amount of protein: 3 to 8 oz is fine. You also don’t want to consume lean protein – low-fat protein can exacerbate insulin spikes. Always consume full-fat foods.
