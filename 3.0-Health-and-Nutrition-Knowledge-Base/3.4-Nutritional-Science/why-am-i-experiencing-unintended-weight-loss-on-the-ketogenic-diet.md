# Why am I experiencing unintended weight loss on the ketogenic diet?

People often start keto for the weight loss benefits but want to continue for the health benefits, even after they’ve lost weight.

**If you find that you’re getting too skinny on keto, avoid unwanted weight loss with these 7 tips:**

1\. Try weight training to build muscle

2\. Add more fat to your diet

3\. Add MCT oil or butter to your coffee or teeccino(Bulletproof coffee)

4\. Try keto bombs!

5\. Add nuts and nut butters to your diet

6\. Increase carbs, but not above 50 grams per day

7\. Increase vegetable intake

You should only consume a moderate amount of protein, around 8 ounces per meal is sufficient. Two meals a day is ideal to prevent extra weight loss on keto.
