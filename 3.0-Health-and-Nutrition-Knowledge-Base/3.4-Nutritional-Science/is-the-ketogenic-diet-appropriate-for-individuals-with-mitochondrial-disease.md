# Is the ketogenic diet appropriate for individuals with mitochondrial disease?

The ketogenic diet is particularly beneficial for mitochondrial health. Mitochondria, the energy factories of our cells, thrive on ketones, which enhance their efficiency. The mitochondria convert food into energy through complex processes involving electrons and other fascinating mechanisms. Adopting a ketogenic diet is one of the best things you can do for your mitochondria.

\***We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**
