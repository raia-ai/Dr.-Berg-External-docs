# Why is it important to read labels on the food products?

One of my staff members purchased peanut butter and asked if it was ok to eat.

It turned out that the product was cookie butter and didn’t even include any peanuts in the ingredients! Upon reading the nutrition facts, I discovered that each 2-tablespoon serving of this cookie butter contained 11 grams of sugar. With 13 servings per container, the cookie butter contained more than 100 grams of sugar!

The first ingredient was wheat flour, followed by sugar and vegetable oil. The main vegetable oil used was soy oil which is GMO and highly inflammatory. Most of the ingredients in this “peanut butter” were highly addictive and highly inflammatory. Always read food labels in their entirety to avoid consuming harmful ingredients.
