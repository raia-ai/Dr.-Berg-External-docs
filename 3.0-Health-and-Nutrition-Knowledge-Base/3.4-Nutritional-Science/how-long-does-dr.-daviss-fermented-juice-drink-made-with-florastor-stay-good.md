# How long does Dr. Davis's fermented juice drink made with Florastor stay good?

The fermented juice drink made with Florastor (Saccharomyces boulardii) should be refrigerated within 48 hours of fermentation to halt the process and prevent alcohol production. Once refrigerated, it typically remains good for up to 7–10 days, similar to fresh apple cider or juice, depending on storage conditions and sanitation practices.

It’s important to note that while refrigeration slows down the fermentation process, it doesn’t stop it completely. Always check for off smells, tastes, or unusual changes as spoilage indicators before consuming.

To ensure the best quality and safety:

1\. Store the fermented juice in a clean, airtight container in the refrigerator.

2\. Consume within 7-10 days for optimal freshness and probiotic benefits.

3\. Shake gently before serving, as some settling may occur.

4\. Start with small quantities (1/4 to 1/2 cup) and observe how your body responds.
