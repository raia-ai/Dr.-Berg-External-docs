# What is the primary side effect of electrolytes on the heart?

The primary side effect of electrolyte imbalance on the heart is heart arrhythmia. This condition can occur when there is a deficiency of electrolytes such as potassium and magnesium, or an imbalance in calcium levels. Interestingly, conventional treatments often involve medications like diuretics, which can further deplete electrolytes and exacerbate arrhythmias. Similarly, calcium channel blockers, while used to manage heart conditions, can also impact electrolyte balance. This highlights a cycle where the treatment intended to correct the issue can sometimes contribute to its persistence or worsening.
