# What are the signs that my gallbladder is in danger?

There are twelve important signs of a gallbladder problem that I want to cover today. But, most of the time, a person with a gallbladder issue doesn't experience any symptoms at all. The majority of the time, a person has no idea they have a problem with the gallbladder. However, even though there are no major symptoms of a gallbladder problem, there are signs that can indicate your gallbladder is in trouble.

Most of these signs are related to a bile deficiency because of a blockage, but excess bile can also lead to issues.

Top signs of a potential gallbladder problem:

1\. Visceral pain under the right rib cage

2\. Nausea

3\. Neck pain

4\. Shoulder pain

5\. Pale or gray stool

6\. Floating stool

7\. Itchy skin (especially at night)

8\. Diarrhea, watery stool, and loss of control over bowel movements (from excess bile)

9\. Dark urine

10\. Jaundice

11\. Vomiting

12\. Constipation
