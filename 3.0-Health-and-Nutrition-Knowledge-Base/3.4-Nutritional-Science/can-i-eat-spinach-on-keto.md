# Can I eat spinach on keto?

Most definitely. It’s rich in iron, magnesium, vitamins K and C, folic acid, B2 and B6. It supports the eyes, preventing macular degeneration, and it’s good for inflammation. The health benefits of spinach are huge.

However, spinach has oxalates, which can cause kidney stones.

To counter oxalates, you can steam your spinach, you can add lemon juice and potassium citrate. You can also consume some calcium-rich food together with the spinach (in the same meal, not separately); this will allow calcium to bind with oxalates in your digestive system so they are prevented from forming stones in the kidneys.

Make sure spinach is organic to avoid unwanted chemicals.
