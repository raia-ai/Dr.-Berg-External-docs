# Are you taking too much zinc?

The recommended daily zinc intake is 11 mg for adult males and 9 mg for adult females. While individuals with deficiencies or infections may benefit from higher doses, adults should not exceed 40 mg daily to avoid toxicity. Factors like low stomach acid, stress, and high sugar intake can contribute to zinc deficiency. Dr. Berg suggests that doses above 40 mg may be beneficial in certain cases. If taking high doses of zinc, it's crucial to supplement with copper at a 10:1 zinc-to-copper ratio. Always consult with a healthcare professional before taking zinc supplements, especially if you have existing health conditions or are on medication.
