# Could calcium silicate in the Trace Minerals Enhanced contribute to the formation of calcium oxalate in the body?

No, calcium silicate in Trace Minerals does not break down into calcium oxalate in the body. Calcium silicate does not release oxalates. Calcium oxalate forms when free calcium ions bind with dietary oxalates. The calcium from the silicate form is unlikely to contribute to this.
