### **Key Points:**

- **Function**: Pancreatic elastase helps break down elastic fibers in proteins.

- **Measurement**: The fecal test measures the amount of pancreatic elastase in a stool sample.

- **Purpose**: It is used to evaluate pancreatic function and diagnose pancreatic insufficiency.

### **Importance:**

- **Digestive Health**: Adequate levels of pancreatic elastase are crucial for proper digestion and nutrient absorption.

- **Diagnostic Tool**: Low levels of pancreatic elastase in the stool can indicate pancreatic insufficiency, which may require medical intervention.
