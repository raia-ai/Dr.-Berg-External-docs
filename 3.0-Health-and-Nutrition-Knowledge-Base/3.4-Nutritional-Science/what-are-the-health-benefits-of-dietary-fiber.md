# What are the health benefits of dietary fiber?

Fiber is a carbohydrate, but it has no effect on blood sugar or insulin. It is low on the glycemic index. It feeds the microbes, the bacteria in the gut, and the microbes give back butyrate (or butyric acid) that then feeds the colon cells energy. Butyrate also helps with blood sugars and can help lower insulin indirectly.

The problem with fiber is that it can cause fluid retention. Certain fibers tend to gel and expand in your gut. It can actually feel like your belly is swelling, as if youâ€™ve gained fat, but actually it is just water weight.

5. Contains small-chain fatty acids

6. May help regulate pH

7. May help regulate lipids

**Where to get it**

Get your fiber from vegetables and not grains. Grains are a problem due to a higher glycemic index and gluten content, and because they have phytic acid which prevents nutrient absorption. Microbes live off your fiber as their food, so vegetable fiber is the best fiber to consume.
