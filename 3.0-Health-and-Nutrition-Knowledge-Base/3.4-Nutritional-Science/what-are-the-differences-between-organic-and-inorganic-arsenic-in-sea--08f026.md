## Organic vs. Inorganic Arsenic in Sea Kelp

Understanding the difference between organic and inorganic arsenic in sea kelp is crucial for making safe dietary choices.

\- Organic Arsenic: Found naturally in plants and animals, including sea kelp, organic arsenic is less harmful due to its lower toxicity. This form is easily digestible and poses minimal risk when consumed within safe limits.

\- Inorganic Arsenic: Typically associated with industrial processes and contaminated water, inorganic arsenic is highly toxic. Prolonged exposure can lead to severe health issues, including skin lesions, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.

When selecting sea kelp supplements, ensure they are sourced from clean environments and have undergone rigorous testing to minimize the risk of inorganic arsenic contamination.
