# Will the lack of copper with the zinc in D3 & K2 Vitamin create a copper deficiency?

The vitamins and minerals in the D3 & K2 Vitamin product are specifically chosen cofactors required to increase the absorption of vitamin D and allow its activation in both bone health and immunity building. Zinc is one of these required cofactors while copper is not.

Zinc and copper do have a recommended ideal ratio of 8:1, with acceptable ranges of 4:1 to 12:1. Zinc deficiency is far more prevalent than copper deficiency as copper can be obtained through many dietary sources. On the other hand, many foods deplete zinc stores due to their phytates, including legumes, seeds, soy products, and whole grains, and their oxalates, including such foods as spinach, okra, nuts, and tea. The D3 & K2 Vitamin is specifically formulated to address zinc deficiency.

Additionally, Vitamin D supplementation can help with copper retention in the body, further reducing the possibility of copper deficiency. However, zinc in high quantities, 60mg or more a day, over a long period of time can cause some copper deficiencies.

Here are some signs of a copper deficiency:

1\. Nausea

2\. Flu-like symptoms (this is due to neutropenia, which is lowered white blood cells)

3\. Anemia (fatigue and weakness)

4\. Stomach pain

5\. Tingling and numbness in the hands or feet

6\. Diarrhea

7\. Loss of skin tone

8\. Vomiting
