# What are the hidden sugars in my food?

**Hidden Sugars in Your Food**

Even foods marketed as healthy can conceal significant amounts of sugar. Hereâ€™s a look at some common culprits:

**Granola**

Often considered a health food, granola can contain up to six teaspoons of sugar per 100-gram serving. Opt for varieties with lower added sugars and monitor portion sizes.

**Coconut Water**

Despite its natural image, a typical bottle of coconut water can contain 20 grams of sugar, equivalent to five teaspoons. Enjoy it in moderation and consider plain water as a primary hydration source.

**Yogurt**

Flavored or fruit-added yogurts, like Activia, can contain up to 18 grams of sugar per four ounces. Choose plain yogurt and add fresh fruit to manage sugar intake while enhancing nutrition.
