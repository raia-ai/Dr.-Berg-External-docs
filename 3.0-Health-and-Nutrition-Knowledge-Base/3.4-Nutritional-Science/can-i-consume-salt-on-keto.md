# Can I consume salt on keto?

Yes. Add Himalayan sea salt to your keto regime.

You need around 1 to 2 tsp of salt per day. This depends on your activity level. If you sweat a lot, this can increase your need for sodium. If you’re on keto, you want a bare minimum of 1 tsp of salt a day. This is because, as you lose fat, you also lose water weight and electrolytes. Salt is a vital electrolyte.

Himalayan salt is actually very different from standard sea salt. Here’s why. Although both Himalayan salt and sea salt have trace minerals, generic sea salt also has microplastics. One study found that 90% of sea salt products had small amounts of plastics. However, Himalayan salt has zero microplastics. Why? Himalayan salt is sourced from an ancient sea that existed before humans and pollution.
