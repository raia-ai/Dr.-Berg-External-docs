# Is depression a disease?

Depression is a mental state. When someone is depressed you can’t take an x-ray to see depression or a blood test to see depression. Depression is subjective. Diseases are objective and they are diagnosed based on some medical test. Depression as an emotion is real and can be caused by many things – like vitamin D deficiency, for example. Also, a lack of sleep can cause chronic fatigue, which can mimic depression.
