# Is calcium silicate safe?

Calcium silicate is a natural anti-caking agent derived from limestone and diatomaceous earth. It is used in small quantities in some of our products to prevent clumping by absorbing moisture, ensuring that our products flow smoothly during production. 

The FDA has recognized calcium silicate as a Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) food additive. However, inhaling it can cause respiratory tract irritation, and consuming it in large quantities can lead to digestive issues.
