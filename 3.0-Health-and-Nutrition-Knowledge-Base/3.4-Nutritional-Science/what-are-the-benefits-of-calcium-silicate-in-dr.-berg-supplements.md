# What are the benefits of calcium silicate in Dr. Berg supplements?

**Calcium Silicate** 

When used in supplements, calcium silicate primarily functions as an anticaking agent.  

- **Prevent clumping:** Calcium silicate absorbs moisture, preventing ingredients from sticking together and ensuring the supplement flows freely during manufacturing and packaging. This maintains the quality and consistency of the product.
