# Which key nutrient is most critical for enhancing collagen synthesis and maintaining its structural integrity within the body?

Copper is essential for collagen synthesis, as it is a crucial cofactor in the enzyme responsible for creating connective tissue. A deficiency in copper, often caused by excessive zinc intake, can lead to weakened collagen, resulting in skin sagging and increased susceptibility to hernias and aneurysms. Ensuring adequate copper levels is vital for maintaining healthy collagen.
