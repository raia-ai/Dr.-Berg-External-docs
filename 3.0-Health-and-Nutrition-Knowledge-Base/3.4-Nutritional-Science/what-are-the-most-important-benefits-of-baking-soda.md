# What are the most important benefits of baking soda?

Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is widely used in baking. Many people get relief from things like acid reflux when they take baking soda, but it comes with a package. The stomach helps you digest proteins, absorb minerals, and kill pathogens. It’s designed to produce and make acid. The stomach should normally be extremely acidic.

A person can experience acid reflux if they lose their stomach acids. Many people think that a person with acid reflux has too much acid, but they actually don’t have strong enough acid.

Baking soda is very alkaline. So, when you take baking soda, you’re going to feel better temporarily, but you’re not fixing the root problem. If you do this, the issue could actually get worse over time because you’re taking the acid out of the stomach and you’re not adding it back in.
