# What are the common reasons for waking up at night?

**Here are 7 reasons why you get up during your sleep:**

1\. High blood sugar: if you’re diabetic or prediabetic and you have high blood sugar you’ll end up peeing more (especially at night) because water attaches itself to the sugar in your body. If you’re new to my channel I put a link below to show you how to fix your blood sugar.

2\. High insulin, which relates to high blood sugar. Insulin stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, better known as fight or flight. Too much stimulation of this system means you can’t hold your bladder, resulting in more frequent urination. So you want to decrease insulin using the same system that fixes blood sugar.

3\. High cortisol. This is the adrenal hormone; the stress hormone. This disrupts the normal sleep cycle ranging from REM sleep to the deep delta wave sleep. You wake up at 2am when you should be in your deepest sleep. Check out the link below to my stress webinar. For now, take vitamin D3.

4\. Consuming coffee or tea; caffeine is a stimulant. Reduce your consumption and drink caffeine only in the morning.

5\. Too much artificial light, especially if you spend a lot of time in front of an LED screen. Put a full spectrum light on your desk. Also, go for a walk to offset all the sitting you do plus get sunlight on your face. Take off your dark glasses and let the light hit your eyes.

6\. Sleep apnea. First, take vitamin B1 in the form of nutritional yeast. And eat a low carb diet. There’s also a condition called lactic acidosis that’s a byproduct of eating too many carbs. It can throw off your pH (see point 7 below). B1 will help.

7\. pH imbalance can affect your sleep, whether your body is too alkaline or too acidic. You won’t be able to absorb minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium if your pH is off. You can take apple cider if it's too alkaline, or minerals if too acidic.
