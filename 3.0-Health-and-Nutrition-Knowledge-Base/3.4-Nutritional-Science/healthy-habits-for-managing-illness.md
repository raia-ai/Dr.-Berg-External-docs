Iron is essential, but too much can feed disease-causing microbes. Luckily, there are safer alternatives that support immunity without encouraging microbial growth.

### **Dietary Changes for Better Health**

During sickness, nutritional changes can enhance overall health status:

- **Eat Whole Foods:** Unprocessed or minimally processed foods contain more natural nutrients than heavily processed ones.

- **Maintain Hydration:** Staying hydrated helps maintain bodily functions. Consume eight glasses of H2O daily or more if experiencing signs of dehydration such as fever, perspiration, vomiting, looseness of the bowels, or other symptoms.

- **Cut Back On Sugar:** Sugar lacks nutritional value and weakens the immune response by reducing the white blood cell activity necessary to fight infection. Limit consumption of sugary drinks, snacks, and desserts, particularly when under the weather.

Advise a medical specialist before adjusting your diet or taking dietary supplements to ensure safety and efficiency.
