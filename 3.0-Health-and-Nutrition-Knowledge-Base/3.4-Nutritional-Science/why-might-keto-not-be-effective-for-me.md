# Why might Keto not be effective for me?

Healthy KetoÂ® emphasizes a balanced macronutrient approach paired with nutrient-dense foods to optimize various health indicators, including energy levels, skin health, weight loss, cognitive function, inflammation, mood, cravings, and hunger management.

To implement keto effectively, consider the following guidelines:

\- **Avoid Fruits and Snacking**: Minimize intake of high-carb fruits and refrain from snacking between meals.

\- **Eat Only When Hungry**: Focus on true hunger cues rather than eating out of habit.

\- **Prioritize Healthy Fats and Greens**: Ensure that the majority of your diet consists of higher-fat foods and leafy greens.

\- **Incorporate Apple Cider Vinegar**: This can aid digestion and support metabolic health.

Aim for a protein intake of 3 to 6 ounces per meal, with fat comprising approximately 70% of your total caloric intake, and carbohydrates limited to 20 to 50 grams per day. For optimal results, consider combining the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting, which can further enhance metabolic flexibility and support weight loss goals.
