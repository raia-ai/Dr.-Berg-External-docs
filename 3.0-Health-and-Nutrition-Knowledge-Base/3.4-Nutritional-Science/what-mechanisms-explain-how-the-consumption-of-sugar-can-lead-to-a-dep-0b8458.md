# What mechanisms explain how the consumption of sugar can lead to a depletion of vitamin B1 in the body?

Vitamin B1 is necessary for the breakdown of carbohydrates. This process is known as carbohydrate catabolism.

So the more carbohydrates that you consume, the more your body needs vitamin B1 for the metabolism of carbs.

When you’re eating a large number of carbs, your vitamin B1 intake often can’t keep up.

The best natural source of vitamin B1 is nutritional yeast. In summary, vitamin B1 is a crucial nutrient. It’s important to replenish your vitamin B1 and avoid high-carb diets.
