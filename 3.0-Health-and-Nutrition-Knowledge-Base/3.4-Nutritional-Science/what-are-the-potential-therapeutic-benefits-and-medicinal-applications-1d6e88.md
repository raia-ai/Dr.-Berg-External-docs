# What are the potential therapeutic benefits and medicinal applications of quinine bark?

The best remedy for leg cramps at night is quinine bark. I’m not talking about the synthetic version that you need a prescription for. This is about the natural bark, which contains a lot less of the active ingredient, quinine. People have been using quinine bark as a remedy for numerous health issues for hundreds and hundreds of years. This natural bark was forgotten about for a while, after the synthetic version came out. However, quinine bark has made a huge comeback recently.
