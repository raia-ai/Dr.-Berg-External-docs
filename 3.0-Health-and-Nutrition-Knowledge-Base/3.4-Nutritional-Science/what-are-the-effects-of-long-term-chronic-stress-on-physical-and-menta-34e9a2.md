# What are the effects of long-term chronic stress on physical and mental health?

Cortisol, released during stress, facilitates coping mechanisms but prolonged elevation can lead to high blood sugars, muscle catabolism, heightened awareness, reduced inflammation, suppressed reproduction, decreased white blood cells, and increased infection risk. Chronic stress weakens cortisol, contributing to conditions like allergies, memory issues, autoimmune disorders, asthma, viral reactivation, insomnia, and abdominal fat accumulation.

To address underlying causes, support adrenal health with outdoor walking, vitamin D exposure, adrenal gland acupressure, and adequate intake of potassium, magnesium, and B-vitamins. Prioritizing quality sleep is essential for cortisol regulation and overall well-being.
