## **Understanding Protein Starvation on a Low-Fat Diet**

Have you ever heard of rabbit starvation? It occurs when you consume too much lean protein without enough fat in your diet. This can lead to protein starvation, which can have some pretty unpleasant side effects.

When you're on a [low-fat diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/think-twice-before-you-start-a-low-fat-diet), it's easy to fall into the trap of relying too heavily on lean protein sources like chicken breast or egg whites. But here's the thing: your body needs fat to function properly.

Without enough fat, you can start to experience some serious health issues.

### **Symptoms and Side Effects of Protein Starvation**

So, what exactly happens when you're not getting enough fat in your diet? Well, for starters, you might start to feel pretty lousy. Common symptoms of protein starvation include:

- [Diarrhea](https://www.drberg.com/blog/diarrhea-on-the-ketogenic-diet)

- Headaches

- Fatigue

- Low blood pressure

- Slow pulse rate

- Insatiable hunger

These symptoms can be pretty debilitating, and they're a clear sign that your body isn't getting the nutrients it needs to function properly. If you're experiencing any of these symptoms on a low-fat diet, it's time to reevaluate your eating habits.

### **The Role of Fat in Preventing Protein Starvation**

So, how much fat do you need to prevent protein starvation? Well, it depends on a few factors, like your age, sex, and activity level. But experts generally recommend getting about 20-35% of your daily calories from fat.

To put that into perspective, let's take a look at rabbit meat. Rabbit is often touted as a lean, healthy protein source. But here's the thing: rabbit meat only has about 8% fat. That's not nearly enough to keep your body functioning properly.

In fact, there have been documented cases of people who have tried to survive solely on rabbit meat and ended up with severe protein starvation. Their bodies simply couldn't handle the lack of fat in their diets.
