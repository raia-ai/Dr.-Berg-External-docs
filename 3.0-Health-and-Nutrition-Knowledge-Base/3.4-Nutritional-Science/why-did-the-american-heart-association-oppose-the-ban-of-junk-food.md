# Why did the American Heart Association oppose the ban of junk food?

Most people know that the American Heart Association receives funding from the junk food industry, so it may not have come as a surprise that they openly rejected the SNAP reform bill. After much embarrassment, they retracted their statements and claimed to no longer oppose the bill. Soda is the most frequently purchased item under the SNAP program. Soda lobbyists argue that the SNAP reform bill violates the liberty of choosing what you want to eat and drink! Junk food companies are paying social media influencers to oppose the SNAP reform bill and focus on food insecurity. Government subsidies for food first started during the Great Depression, but they have since become much more corrupt. Today, the system continues to make the junk food industry richer. Big Food and Big Pharma continue to benefit from this system at the expense of taxpayers and the health of the American people. The SNAP program should allow people to purchase nutrient-dense foods and prevent the purchase of ultra-processed foods. This would reduce chronic disease and save people money on prescription medications. Junk food companies oppose SNAP reform because a tremendous amount of money is at stake. Soda industry subsidies alone are a 10 billion dollar business!
