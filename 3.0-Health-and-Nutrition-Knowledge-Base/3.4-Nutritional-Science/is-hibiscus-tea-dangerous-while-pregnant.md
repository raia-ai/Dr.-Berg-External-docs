# Is Hibiscus tea dangerous while pregnant?

Hibiscus has estrogenic effects, which can potentially mimic the effects of estrogen, the primary female sex hormone.  

These effects can either interfere with normal estrogen signaling or amplify estrogen's impact, which can result in an increased risk of bleeding during the first trimester and may trigger premature labor.
