# Can I rely on nutritional facts alone to determine whether the food is healthy?

Let’s compare the nutrition facts of Product A and Product B to see which food is healthier. Product A contains 29 grams of total fat, 4 grams of saturated fat, 17 grams of carbohydrates, and 1 gram of sugar.

Product B contains 8 grams of total fat, 1 gram of saturated fat, 16 grams of carbohydrates, and 0 grams of sugar. Based on these nutrition facts, which food is healthier?

Product A is an avocado, and Product B is Doritos! Doritos contain corn, vegetable oil, maltodextrin, monosodium glutamate, dextrose, and many other poor ingredients—yet you may have thought Product B was the healthier food. You can't rely on nutritional facts alone to determine whether a food is healthy; you must look at the ingredients.

Food is “that which is eaten to sustain life, provide energy, and promote the growth and repair of tissues.” Ultra-processed foods do not align with this definition! I believe that of everything that causes disease and destroys your health, ultra-processed foods are the most significant factor.
