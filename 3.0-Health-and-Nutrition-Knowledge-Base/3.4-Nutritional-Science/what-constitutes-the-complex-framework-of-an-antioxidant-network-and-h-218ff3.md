# What constitutes the complex framework of an antioxidant network, and how do its components interact to neutralize oxidative stress?

A free radical is an atom with an unpaired electron and could create a lot of damage inside the body. While an antioxidant is an atom that has a paired electron, it's stable and balanced and it also donates one of its electrons to make the free radical stable.

**Examples of Free Radicals and Oxidants:**

• Iron – In some of the enriched food

• Sugar – Large quantities of sugar destroy the body

• Chemicals / Pollution / Smoking
