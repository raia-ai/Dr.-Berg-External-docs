# What steps should be taken if conventional acne treatments prove ineffective?

Let's say you've tried everything to get rid of acne, including the healthy version of keto and fasting, but you still have acne. What can you do? If you haven't tried healthy keto and fasting yet, this combination may be very beneficial to help clear up acne.

A spike in androgens, a spike in estrogen, or a spike in both of these hormones could be what's behind your acne. Stress is one thing that can spike androgens and cause acne. It's important to do what you can to lower your stress levels.

DHT is something that can trigger acne. A few potential remedies for acne in this situation are saw palmetto, stinging nettle root, or black cohosh. A spike in estrogen (estrogen dominance) can be behind acne, especially cystic acne. There is an enzyme called aromatase that converts testosterone into estrogen. A few potential natural remedies for acne in this situation are stinging nettle root, cruciferous vegetables, and DIM.

Your liver regulates excessive amounts of hormones, especially estrogen. There could be something going on creating a buffer. A powerful natural remedy for this situation is milk thistle. Of course, the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting may be beneficial too.

High levels of insulin can potentially cause acne and many other symptoms. Consuming a high-carb diet could cause high levels of insulin.

Dairy may also cause high estrogen. If you have a problem with acne, cutting out dairy may clear it up.

**Tips to get rid of acne:**

• Avoid dairy

• Avoid sugar and refined carbs

• Lower your stress

• Take certain herbs based on your situation

• Take zinc

• Take cod liver oil
