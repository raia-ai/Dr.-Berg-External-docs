# If I'm underweight with autoimmune issues, what should my eating schedule look like autoimmune?

For someone who is underweight with autoimmune issues, incorporating intermittent fasting can be highly beneficial due to its anti-inflammatory effects. Consider adopting a one-meal-a-day (OMAD) approach, ensuring that your single meal is nutrient-dense and includes healthy fats. Prioritize adequate vitamin D intake, as it plays a crucial role in managing inflammation and supporting overall health. Tailoring your eating schedule to include these elements can help address both weight and autoimmune concerns effectively.
