# I just started keto. Can I have a cheat meal?

It is certainly not recommended.

When you first start keto and youâ€™re not fully adapted to fat burning, just one cheat meal can mean it takes you a lot longer (24+ hours) to get back on track.

Look for alternative types of pleasure foods that mimic the brownies, cakes, cookies, bread, pizza etc. that you crave. Go for keto-friendly, low-carb, no-sugar treats to satisfy that craving.

Once you start cheating it is hard to stop because sugar is addictive. Having cheat meals will put your blood sugar levels on a roller coaster. Having unstable blood sugars will not help you correct insulin problems that are a barrier to weight loss.

Once you are fully keto-adapted and have enough health reserve, if you decide to have a cheat meal you can bounce back a lot quicker to make up for the damage. Your goal is to create health with consistency. Start where you are and build yourself up to being 100%.
