# What type of yogurt does Dr. Berg recommend, and what are the key characteristics or qualities that make it a preferred choice for health benefits?

**Trimona is a type of yogurt that I think is very special.**

A few reasons why I like Trimona:

• It’s grass-fed

• They use cows that generate A2 protein versus A1 (less allergies)

• It’s organic

• It’s whole fat

• It’s fermented for 30 hours

• It’s non-strained

• There are no thickeners or additives

• It’s plain

• It’s non-GMO

**Trimona has:**

• 10g of carbs

• 6g of sugar

• 8g of protein

• 8g of fat

**Trimona also has friendly bacteria, including lactobacillus bulgaricus. A few potential benefits of lactobacillus bulgaricus:**

• Could help improve lactose intolerance

• Stimulates the immune system

• Supports the liver

• Could help decrease diarrhea

• Could help decrease inflammation in the gut

• Could help decrease constipation

The pH of this yogurt is more acidic than other products out there. Also, because it’s grass-fed, it’s going to have higher amounts of a certain type of fat called CLA. Even though it’s an omega 6 fatty acid, it doesn’t create inflammation. It may actually help the immune system, help build muscle, and even help promote weight loss. This product also has a good amount of omega 3 fatty acids, vitamin A, and even vitamin K2.
