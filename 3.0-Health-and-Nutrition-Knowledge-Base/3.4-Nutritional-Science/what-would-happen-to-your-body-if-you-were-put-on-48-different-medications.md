# What would happen to your body if you were put on 48 different medications?

This is the average number of medications a person takes in an assisted living home in the United States. Hal Cranmer, owner of A Paradise for Parents, and Claud Covaci, CEO of Synkwise, weigh in on the true cost of healthcare.

Claud is the CEO of a software company that manages the medications people take in assisted living homes. In a sampling of 100 residents, the average resident is on 48 medications. Some residents were even taking up to 91 medications! This isn’t healthcare. In Hal’s assisted living homes, he implements programs to help people get off their medications. Many of his residents have seen a 50% decrease in medication usage. Hal focuses on diet and doesn't serve ultra-processed foods in his facilities.

Dementia is the top problem in assisted living homes and is extremely expensive, costing an average of $800,000 to $1.5 million per person. Hal explains that dementia starts in your 30s and 40s, so it’s a very difficult condition to reverse. Under Hal’s protocol, he has seen improvement, even in people with dementia.

The US healthcare system is focused on medicine, not food, but food is the most significant contributor to your health! Medications treat the side effects of junk food consumption, and the side effects of medications are then treated with more medication.

The ultimate goal should be to decrease medications, get people off them, and hopefully help them regain independence. The current healthcare model does not support these goals.

One record for a single patient shows they’re on medication for high blood pressure, cholesterol, tremors, blood clots, stool softeners, antidepressants, seizures, insulin, schizophrenia, runny nose, nausea, prostate enlargement, and more. This is insane!

Failing to address the diet before prescribing these medications misses the root cause of the problems.
