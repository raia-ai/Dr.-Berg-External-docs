# What is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)?

This type of vertigo makes you feel like you’re spinning when you’re not, and it’s the #1 cause of dizziness. This condition is typically caused by a calcium crystal that has broken off and is in the canals of the inner ear that control equilibrium and balance. There is a simple test called the Dix-Hallpike test that you can do at home to help determine if you have this type of vertigo.

Check with your doctor before doing this test to ensure you don’t have an issue with your cervical spine that could prevent you from rotating your neck. After you perform the test and determine which side is causing a problem, you can try the Epley maneuver. The goal of this maneuver is to create different motions to slowly move the calcium crystal out of the ear. An interesting systematic review and meta-analysis done in 2020 showed an association between low vitamin D and BPPV. Vitamin D supports the absorption and transportation of calcium. It's important to note that some people have a genetic issue that causes normal vitamin D levels in the blood but not the tissues. I believe one of the best natural remedies for BPPV is a combination of vitamin D3 and vitamin K2. For every 10,000 IU of vitamin D3, you would want 100 mcg of vitamin K2. Talk to your doctor about taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 and 500 mcg of vitamin K2 once a week for BPPV.
