# What is a gallbladder attack?

The liver makes bile that travels down through small tubes to be stored in the gallbladder. Usually a gallbladder attack is when a stone gets stuck in one of the small tubes, resulting in pressure that is going to cause a lot of pain and inflammation.

Symptoms

- Stomach pain

- Nausea

- Right shoulder pain

- Pain under right rib cage

- Inability to digest fats

- Bloating

**Cause #1: Gallstones**

A gallstone is mostly made of cholesterol. However, your body needs a certain amount of cholesterol. Gallstones form in the liver/gallbladder ducts. This can create pressure in the ducts and can cause a lot of pain. If you go on a low-fat diet, your risk of gallstones actually goes up. A lack of bile is what causes these stones to form.

**Too much insulin** can deplete your bile reserves and that can result in stone formation in the ducts.

**Too much cortisol** can shut down bile production, causing the formation of stones. **Too much estrogen** can cause stone formation as well.
