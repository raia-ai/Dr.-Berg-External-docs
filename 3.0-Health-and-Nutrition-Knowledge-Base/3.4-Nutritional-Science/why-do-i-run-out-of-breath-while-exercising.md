# Why do I run out of breath while exercising?

If your heart rate takes a long time to return to normal after sprints, it might be due to a weaker parasympathetic nervous system, which controls recovery. Here are some tips to improve your recovery and endurance:

1\. **Exercise**: Do shorter workouts with sprints followed by longer rest periods to train your parasympathetic system.

2\. **Supplements**: Consider Co-enzyme Q10, Vitamin K2, and Vitamin E for better endurance.

3\. **Diet**: Achieve deeper ketosis and incorporate fasting to improve endurance.

For accurate assessment, testing with heart rate variability equipment is recommended. These steps should help strengthen your recovery system and enhance performance.
