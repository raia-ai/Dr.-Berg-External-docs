# How can I increase copper intake through diet?

Maintaining our natural hair color and forming collagen and connective tissue both require copper. To ensure that you're getting enough copper in your diet, Dr. Berg suggests consuming the following foods:

- Shellfish

- Mushrooms, especially shiitake mushrooms

- Organ meats, especially liver and kidneys

- Almonds

- Dark, leafy greens

- Oysters

- Sesame seeds

Copper from supplementation is available as well, however, copper from whole foods is always best.
