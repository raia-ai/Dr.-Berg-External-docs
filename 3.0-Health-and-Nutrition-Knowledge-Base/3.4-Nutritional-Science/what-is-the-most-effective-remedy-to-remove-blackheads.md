# What is the most effective remedy to remove blackheads?

A big mistake is doing things like over-cleansing the skin and using pore strips. These things actually make the problem worse by removing friendly bacteria that are there to help protect you against bad bacteria.

The root cause of blackheads is a spike in androgens caused by a spike in insulin and IGF-1.

**How to get rid of blackheads permanently:**

1\. Go on a low-carb diet (Healthy Keto)

2\. Cut out dairy from your diet

3\. Decrease omega-6 fatty acids and increase omega-3 fatty acids

4\. Take borage oil
