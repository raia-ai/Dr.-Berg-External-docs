# Do gelatin and hydrolyzed collagen products contain monosodium glutamate (MSG)?

Hydrolyzed collagen and gelatin contain MSG (monosodium glutamate) or create MSG during processing. The chemical breakdown of gelatin and hydrolyzed proteins like collagen releases glutamic acid, which then combines with sodium to form MSG. Gelatin, derived from collagen, also contains significant amounts of free glutamic acid that can be considered MSG.

If you are using or considering using hydrolyzed collagen or gelatin for hair growth and you are reactive to MSG, topical biotin, and consumption of trace minerals and natural plants, herbs, and roots such as saw palmetto, horsetail herb, and ginseng may be a better solution.
