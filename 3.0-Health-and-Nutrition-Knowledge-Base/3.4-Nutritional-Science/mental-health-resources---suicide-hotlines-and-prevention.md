# Mental Health Resources - Suicide Hotlines and Prevention

First and foremost, we want to express our sincere concern for your challenges and appreciate your openness in sharing your feelings with us.

Unfortunately, we are unable to assist in matters related to mental health here at Dr. Berg Nutritionals. However, please know that your well-being is of utmost importance to us. We strongly recommend seeking professional help to address these concerns and receive the necessary care.

If you are a citizen of the United States, we strongly encourage you to call 988 from any phone to connect with the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. For those outside the US, the resource [International Suicide Hotline - OpenCounseling: OpenCounseling](https://blog.opencounseling.com/suicide-hotlines/) provides a comprehensive list of international phone numbers you can call for assistance.

Remember, you're not alone, and there is support available. Whether you choose to explore the resources provided or have questions about our expertise in nutritional health, we are here for you.
