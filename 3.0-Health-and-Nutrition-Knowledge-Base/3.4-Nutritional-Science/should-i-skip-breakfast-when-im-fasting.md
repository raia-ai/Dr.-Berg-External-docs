# Should I skip breakfast when I'm fasting?

Skipping breakfast can be an excellent way to adjust your body to intermittent fasting and has many benefits. Because eating breakfast every morning can slow your metabolism, those looking to boost theirs may want to skip the first meal of the day.

Eating first thing in the morning also spikes your insulin, which halts the many benefits your body reaps overnight as you don't eat. And third, skipping breakfast can be beneficial because most typical breakfast foods are high in sugar and will cause your blood sugar to crash early in the day.
