# What is the most effective nutrient for cancer prevention and treatment, and how does it inhibit tumor growth and support cellular health?

Sulforaphane is a phytonutrient that has been studied extensively. You can get sulforaphane from many different plants, but the best source of sulforaphane is broccoli sprouts or broccoli microgreens. Broccoli sprouts or broccoli microgreens have 10 to 100 times more sulforaphane than broccoli. The majority of nutrients in plants, especially phytonutrients, are in the early stages of growth. Sprouts and microgreens also have much fewer anti-nutrients, which can irritate the gut.

Sprouts and microgreens are incredibly nutritious and are great choices if you have a hard time consuming large amounts of vegetables. You can consume fewer of them to get a good amount of nutrients and phytonutrients.
