# Which is more advantageous for health: sardines or cod liver oil, and what are the key benefits of each?

Sardines are excellent for your health and a great source of omega-3s, but so is cod liver! You should consume both foods because they each have their own strengths.

**Cod liver and sardines contain omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. EPA helps reduce inflammation, while DHA supports the brain, nerves, and heart.**

**Sardines contain .9 to 2 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per serving while cod liver contains 9 to 11 grams per serving. Cod liver also contains significantly more vitamin D.**

**Sardines and cod liver contain vitamin A in its active form, retinol.** Vitamin A supports vision, vision at night, and the inner mucosal membranes of your mouth, throat, sinuses, and lungs. Itâ€™s also important for your thyroid. Sardines contain 32 mcg of vitamin A, and cod liver contains 5100 mcg!

**Cod liver does not surpass sardines in all aspects. Sardines are a better source of protein.** Cod liver is a rich source of folate at 300 mcg, while sardines only contain 10 mcg. Sardines contain 392 mg of calcium and 545 mg of phosphorus and cod liver contains 10 mg and 100 mg respectively.

**Cod liver and sardines contain about the same amount of B12 at 10.6 mcg and 11 mcg respectively.**

When comparing sardines to salmon, both fish contain B vitamins, but sardines are a better source of calcium, phosphorus, selenium, iron, magnesium, and zinc.
