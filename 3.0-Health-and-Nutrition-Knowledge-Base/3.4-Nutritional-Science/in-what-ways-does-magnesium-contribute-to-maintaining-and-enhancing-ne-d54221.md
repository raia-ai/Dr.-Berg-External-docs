# In what ways does magnesium contribute to maintaining and enhancing nerve health, and what specific mechanisms underlie its role in neurological function and protection?

Magnesium supports nerve health in a couple of ways:

- **Nerve and Muscle:** Magnesium plays a role in nerve function and muscle contraction, contributing to overall health and well-being. 

- **Nerve System Support:** Magnesium plays a role in the function of neurotransmitters, which are essential for various bodily functions, including mood and relaxation. 

- **Nerve Health Support:** Magnesium contributes to healthy nerve function and may support the body's natural defenses against oxidative stress. 

- **Muscle Health Support:** Magnesium plays a role in muscle relaxation and contraction, contributing to overall muscle health and function.
