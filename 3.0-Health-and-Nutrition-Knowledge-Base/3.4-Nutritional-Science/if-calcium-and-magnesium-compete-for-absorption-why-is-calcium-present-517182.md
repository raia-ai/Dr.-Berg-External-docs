# If calcium and magnesium compete for absorption, why is calcium present in the Electrolyte Powder?

Dr. Berg recommends against taking magnesium and calcium supplements simultaneously, as they can hinder each other's absorption. However, he points out that a small amount of calcium in a supplement with a significantly higher proportion of magnesium, such as his electrolyte products, is acceptable. The issue arises when the ratio of calcium to magnesium is closer to 1:1.
