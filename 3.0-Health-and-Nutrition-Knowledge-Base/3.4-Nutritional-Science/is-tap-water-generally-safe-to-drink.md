# Is tap water generally safe to drink?

**Tap water is toxic - especially if you live in the southern part of the United States, where there are high levels of estrogen in the water. These high levels of estrogen can shut down testosterone in men and put a woman into estrogen dominance.**

There is also fluoride in tap water, which can affect the thyroid and skin. On top of that there is a chemical called chloramine, which is not good for the body.

The fact that there is a legal dose of these chemicals in tap water does not mean that they are safe. The legal limits of these contaminants have not been evaluated for 20 years.

The following are a few chemicals that could be in your tap water. Four of these five chemicals are known to cause cancer.

- Bromodichloromethane

- Chloroform

- Haloacetic acid

- Nitrates

- TTHM (total trihalomethanes)
