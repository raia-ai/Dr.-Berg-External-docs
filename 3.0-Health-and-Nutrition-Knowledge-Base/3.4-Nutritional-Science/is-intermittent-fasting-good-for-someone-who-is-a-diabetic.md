# Is intermittent fasting good for someone who is a diabetic?

Diabetes is a condition of high sugar (hyperglycemia). The purpose of the medication that diabetic takes is to lower blood sugars â€“ sometimes the medication could drive the blood sugar too low that could cause hypoglycemia.

When you do intermittent fasting, you decrease the need for insulin and the medication for a diabetic. The insulin that the diabetic is taking is not the same as the body produces.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**
