# What are the best vitamins for eye health?

Vitamins A, B, C, D, and E are some of the best vitamins to promote healthy vision and reduce the risk of eye diseases, including dry eye syndrome, night blindness, and optic neuropathy. 

Additionally, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin are associated with good eye health and a lower risk of age-related macular degeneration.
