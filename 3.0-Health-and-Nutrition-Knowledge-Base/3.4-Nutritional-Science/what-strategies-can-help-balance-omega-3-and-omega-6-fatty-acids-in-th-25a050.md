# What strategies can help balance Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids in the diet, and why is this balance important for overall health?

The omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is way off in the average diet. The average American is at a 20:1 and sometimes a 70:1 or more omega-6 to omega-3 ratio!

**We need both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, but we need significantly more omega-3 fatty acids to avoid inflammation.** The source is important! You don’t want to get your omega-6 fatty acids from seed oils.

Omega-6 consumption from seed oils directly correlates with chronic illnesses like heart disease. Very recently in human history, seed oils replaced saturated fat in the diet and are in every ultra-processed food. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids include fatty fish, cod liver oil, cod liver, sardines, and shellfish.

**Grain-fed animals are much higher in omega-6 fatty acids. This is one of the reasons people are turning to grass-fed, grass-finished beef.**

Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids go through the same biochemical pathways and compete with each other in the body. If there’s any problem in these biochemical pathways, you can end up with dysfunctional fats that your body will be unable to benefit from.

Co-factors for these biochemical pathways include magnesium, vitamins B2, B3, B6, vitamin C, and insulin. Many people are insulin resistant, which means they’re deficient in insulin. Seed oil consumption paired with insulin resistance causes a lot more compound damage.

**Intermittent fasting and a low-carb diet can correct insulin resistance so you’re better able to utilize fatty acids within the body and don’t end up with dysfunctional fats.**

Omega-3 fatty acids fall into two categories: DHA and EPA. EPA helps reduce inflammation, and DHA helps support cognitive function. ALA is a precursor to EPA.

There’s a simple blood test that can measure your omega-3 to omega-6 ratio.
