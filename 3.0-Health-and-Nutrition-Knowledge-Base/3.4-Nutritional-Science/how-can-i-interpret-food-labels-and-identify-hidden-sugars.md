# How can I interpret food labels and identify hidden sugars?

Many supposedly "sugar-free" items can still contain hidden sugars, disguised under names like "real cane sugar," "brown sugar," or "coconut sugar." Even terms like "organic" or "made with real fruit" can be misleading, as the products are still heavily processed and contain added sugars. "Whole grains" and "brown rice sugar" may sound healthier, but they can still impact blood sugar levels. "Natural" doesn't necessarily mean healthy either. Always check labels carefully and be aware of hidden sugars in seemingly "healthy" foods.
