# How do I use Epsom salt for toenail fungus?

Epsom salt is an effective ingredient. It’s a naturally occurring mineral salt that has some pretty good antimicrobial and anti-fungal properties. Here’s what you do:

Dissolve two tablespoons of Epsom salt into four cups of water in a bucket. You can boil the water first, although you don’t have to. The main thing is to get the salt dissolved. Keep the water warm, but if you’ve boiled it first be sure to let it cool down to a comfortable temperature.

Soak your feet in the mixture daily for fifteen minutes. Do this for three to four weeks. You’ll see a great improvement. I suggest you also use a nail file to get rid of some of the dead nails because the problem is that the fungus tends to get up underneath the nail and destroys it.

**Depending on how infected the nail is, you may find that your nail has to come off then regrow. Or if the infection isn’t too deep, your nail may just grow without the microbe that’s been fading it.**

**Avoid moisture, because this microbe likes a humid environment. So go to work without your shoes on. Just don’t tell them it was me who said so!**

All these steps are part of an at-home toenail fungus treatment that’s simple and effective.
