## **Why You Should Avoid Iron When Sick**

Feeling sick? Skip the iron. While it's crucial for our bodies, extra iron intake during illness can be counterproductive.

### **The Protective Mechanism of Ferritin Storage**

Ferritin stores iron and acts as a protective mechanism when we get sick. By limiting iron availability in the bloodstream, ferritin helps prevent disease-causing microbes from thriving.

However, consuming additional iron while ill could feed harmful bacteria instead of starving them off.

### **Risks Associated with Excess Iron Consumption When Unwell**

Taking extra iron when sick undermines your body's natural defenses and poses other risks. For instance, excessive free iron levels have been linked with increased [oxidative stress](https://www.drberg.com/blog/oxidative-stress-immune-system-and-viral-infection), inflammation, and disease progression in certain conditions like infections or cancer.

- **Oxidative Stress:** Occurs when there's an imbalance between free radical and antioxidant activity in your body. An imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body may cause cellular and tissue harm.

- **Inflammation:** High levels of circulating free iron have also been associated with inflammation - another factor that can exacerbate illness symptoms.

- **Disease Progression:** Some studies suggest excess dietary or supplemental iron may contribute to disease progression in certain conditions like infections or cancer.

Avoiding high-iron foods and supplements might be beneficial during sickness periods, especially considering how easy it is for most people to meet their daily recommended intake without supplementation.
