# What can help boost low levels of collagen?

Copper is a vital trace mineral crucial for collagen production and elastin formation. It supports enzymatic processes that aid in protein synthesis, essential for maintaining skin elasticity and preventing collagen loss.

Beyond its role in skin health, copper facilitates iron transport, bolsters immunity, and may reduce excessive sweating. It also supports endurance during exercise, helps delay hair greying, improves balance, detoxifies fluoride, and promotes warmth in extremities. Rich dietary sources of copper include liver, kidney, oysters, shellfish, shiitake mushrooms, and sesame seeds. Incorporating these foods can ensure adequate copper intake for overall health benefits.
