# What are the potential health benefits of incorporating herbs into one’s diet or wellness regimen?

Herbs are any plants with leaves, seeds or flowers used for flavoring, food, medicine or perfume. Out of all of the categories of foods, herbs are at the top of the list for the antioxidants they provide. Antioxidants provide health benefits in addition to the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients in the herbs.

**Best herbs for parasites**

A parasite is a microorganism like a worm or bacteria that basically lives on the energy of your body, but doesn’t give anything back. Even though your friendly bacteria live on energy from your body, they are not parasites because they are actually providing a lot of benefits in exchange.

Herbs for parasites include:

- Wormwood

- Black walnut hulls

- Garlic

- Clove

Before you start these herbs, you may want to take purified bile salts. You can take it 3 times a day on an empty stomach. Then the next day, you could try taking the herbs. You may want to start slowly and gradually work your way up to the recommended dose on the package.

When you do a parasite cleanse, you may want to do it for at least one month. You could even do it for six weeks before you stop taking the herbs and see how you do. It’s not a bad idea to do this every 6 months or so.
