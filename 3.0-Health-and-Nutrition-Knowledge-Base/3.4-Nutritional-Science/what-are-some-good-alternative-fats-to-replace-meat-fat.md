# What are some good alternative fats to replace meat fat?

When looking to replace meat fat, consider incorporating high-quality alternatives such as MCT oil, which provides quick energy, or cod liver oil, rich in essential omega-3 fatty acids. Another excellent option is raw cream from grass-fed cows, which can be used in various waysâ€”added to coffee, cooked with, or even paired with fruit. Raw cream also contains the Wulzen factor, known for its anti-stiffness properties. Each of these fats offers unique benefits, making them valuable additions to a balanced diet.
