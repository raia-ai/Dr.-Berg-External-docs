# What are the most effective treatment options and management strategies for addressing Dupuytren’s contracture?

Dupuytren’s contracture a condition in which one or more fingers becomes permanently bent in a flexed position. So there's a couple of different theories of it. They don't really know exactly why it is, but I will say that I would take because we have a contracture, I would take magnesium first.

You can take different versions like glycosinate is a, is a good type of magnesium and I wouldn't also avoid calcium. I would probably take a calcium. Usually you can get magnesium with calcium in there and that way you have the minerals to allow the contraction and relaxation of muscles. Now the other point about this contraction is that if your pH is too on the alkaline side, that can create these minerals from working correctly. So you may find that if you acidify the body with either ongoing apple cider vinegar and or a tainted hydrochloride, you can take it when you eat for your digestive system. You may find that that allows us minerals to work a lot better as well.

it's either a pH problem, I'm guessing, or a mineral problem between magnesium and calcium.
