# Which vitamins help prevent diabetic complications, and how do they support blood sugar, nerve health, and metabolism?

**Today I’m going to share five vitamins that can help with the complications of diabetes. High blood glucose affects four main tissues, including:**

1\. The eyes

2\. The arteries

3\. The nervous system (including the brain)

4\. The kidneys

However, the damage to these tissues can lead to a myriad of health problems. Glycation is a combination of sugar and protein in the body, and it can lead to this dysfunction of tissues. An A1C score is basically a number that represents glycated hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells) to help tell how bad someone’s diabetes is. Glycation can also occur when someone consumes a combination of sugar or carbs and protein or fat. When glycation occurs, it can build up into advanced glycation end products (AGEs). With AGEs comes a lot of free radical damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress.

**The good news is that there are natural things that can inhibit glycation. Vitamins that inhibit glycation:**

1\. Benfotiamine

2\. Vitamin C

3\. Vitamin D

4\. Vitamin E (tocotrienols complex without tocopherols)

5\. Vitamin B6
