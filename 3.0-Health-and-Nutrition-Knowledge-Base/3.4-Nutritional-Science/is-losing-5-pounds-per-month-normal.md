# Is losing 5 pounds per month normal?

It depends. Some people would say that it’s not normal and that you should be losing a lot more.

When you evaluate anything, you’re comparing what’s normal and what’s going on with you. So, it’s very important for you to know what is normal and what’s not. Someone with a healthy fast metabolism could lose about two pounds of fat per week. If a person is fasting for a week, they might lose about 3.5 pounds.

But, you might have a slow metabolism, which means you might only lose one pound per week. Normal weight loss for someone with a slow metabolism is half a pound to one pound of fat per week. So, four pounds of fat loss per month isn’t bad for someone with a slow metabolism.

It’s important to keep in mind that it only takes a tiny amount of carbohydrates to block fat burning for two to three days. There are different factors like this to look at, so you can know what normal actually is and so you don’t get frustrated and give up when it’s actually working.
