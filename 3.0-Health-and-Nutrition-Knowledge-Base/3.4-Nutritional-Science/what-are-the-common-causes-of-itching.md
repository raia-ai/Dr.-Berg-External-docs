# What are the common causes of itching?

Itching can be caused by:

1\. Body lice

2\. Scabies

3\. Hookworms

4\. Herpes

5\. Insect bites

6\. Yeast infection

7\. Poison ivy

8\. Tick bites

9\. Diabetes

10\. Polycythemia

11\. Parathyroid gland issues

12\. Uremia

13\. Liver issues

14\. Cholestasis

15\. Dry skin

Diabetes and polycythemia can cause itching due to poor circulation. Overactive parathyroid glands lead to excessive calcium, affecting nerves and causing itchiness. Liver issues and cholestasis can impair bile salt production, causing itching. Dry skin is often due to vitamin A or D deficiency. TUDCA and dietary changes can help reduce itching in liver conditions.
