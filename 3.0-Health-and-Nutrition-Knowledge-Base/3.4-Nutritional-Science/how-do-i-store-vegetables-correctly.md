# How do I store vegetables correctly?

**Optimal Vegetable Storage for Nutritional Retention**

**Freezing vs. Refrigeration**

Freezing vegetables is generally more effective than refrigeration for preserving nutrients. The cold temperatures of a freezer slow down the degradation of vitamins and minerals, maintaining the nutritional value of vegetables longer. Frozen vegetables are also convenient and often more economical.

**Refrigeration Tips**

To extend the freshness of refrigerated vegetables, lightly spray them with water to maintain humidity and prevent drying. Store vegetables in airtight containers or plastic bags to reduce air exposure and minimize nutrient loss. Proper refrigeration keeps vegetables fresh and nutritious for extended periods.
