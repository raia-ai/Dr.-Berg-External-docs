# What can I do for dermatitis and eczema?

Often, skin issues may indicate underlying gut inflammation or liver involvement, potentially linked to dysbiosisâ€”a microbial imbalance in the gut flora.

Consider previous antibiotic use or gut infections as potential contributors to these issues. Professional guidance can help target these underlying causes effectively.
