# Update on the usage of microcrystalline in Dr. Berg's products

We're excited to share that we are actively transitioning to formulas without microcrystalline cellulose! We are replacing microcrystalline cellulose with the amino acid L-leucine in our products.

Only two products, Vitamin D3 & K2 and Trace Minerals Enhanced, will continue to contain a small amount of microcrystalline cellulose. This is due to challenges encountered during production where the ingredients adhered to the machinery without it. Rest assured, we are actively researching and developing solutions to eliminate it from these products as well.

Our new and improved formula, featuring L-leucine instead of microcrystalline cellulose, is already in our Natural Vitamin B1+! This positive change will extend across our entire product line as existing inventory is replenished so you can enjoy the enhanced formula in all your favorite Dr. Berg products very soon.
