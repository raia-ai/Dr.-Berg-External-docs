# What is the optimal dosage of vitamin D recommended to address hair loss, and how might individual health factors impact the appropriate intake?

How much vitamin D you should take depends on your vitamin D levels, average sunlight exposure, health status, and skin tone. The NIH suggests taking 600 IU of vitamin D daily. However, if you are severely deficient, you may require significantly higher doses of vitamin D to achieve and maintain healthy blood levels.
