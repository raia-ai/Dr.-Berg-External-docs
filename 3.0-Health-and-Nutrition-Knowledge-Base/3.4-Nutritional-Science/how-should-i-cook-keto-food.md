# How should I cook Keto food?

Yes.

Here are some ways to avoid complex recipes and cooking on keto:

- Buy boiled eggs – add butter, mayonnaise, sour cream, salt and pepper

- Simple salad – lettuce (salad) with olive oil and vinegar

- Sauté spinach with canned tuna or sardines, and you can shake some Parmesan cheese on it as well

- Eat sardines – simple, healthy and convenient

- Consume nuts or nut butters during your meals

- Eat celery with hummus or nut butters

- Consume fattier cheeses

- Get high-quality summer sausages or ham at the health food store, and sometimes combine them with cheeses

- Consume protein shakes (but not whey or soy protein)

- Mushrooms with cheese could also be a good meal addition

- Prepare keto bombs over the weekend and keep them in the freezer as keto-friendly desserts
