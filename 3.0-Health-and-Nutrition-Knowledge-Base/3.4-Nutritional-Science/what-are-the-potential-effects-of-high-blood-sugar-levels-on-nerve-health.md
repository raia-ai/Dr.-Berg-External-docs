# What are the potential effects of high blood sugar levels on nerve health?

There could be damage to your motor or sensory nerves. The condition is called peripheral neuropathy. You can also have problems with the autonomic nerves and even the nerves to the eye, and high blood sugar can also affect the blood vessels that innervate your nerves.

Dr. Berg recommends the ketogenic approach and intermittent fasting, including adding B-vitamins (from the nutritional yeast). B-vitamins also supports the myelin sheath around the nerves.
