# Why does Dr. Berg use synthetic ingredients such as Alpha Lipoid Acid?

**Why Are Synthetic Ingredients Used in Dr. Berg’s Products?**

In the world of supplements, natural isn’t always better, and synthetic doesn’t mean unsafe or inferior. Synthetic ingredients are often chosen because they’re the only way to deliver precise, powerful, and proven results. Here’s why certain synthetic ingredients are used in Dr. Berg’s formulas:

**Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA)**

Clinically Supported Blend: The synthetic form (s-ALA) contains both R-ALA (the naturally occurring, active form) and S-ALA. This racemic mixture is the same form used in most clinical studies, which have shown benefits for blood sugar balance, antioxidant support, and nerve health.

Stable and Reliable: While R-ALA is more bioactive, it’s also unstable in isolation, which can reduce its effectiveness unless it’s carefully stabilized. The s-ALA blend ensures long-term stability, purity, and shelf life.

Effective: s-ALA delivers a consistent, research-backed dose of active ALA in a form your body can use, without the limitations of isolated R-ALA.

Bottom Line: While pure R-ALA may offer enhanced potency, the synthetic blend offers proven, practical support in a stable format used in most ALA research.
