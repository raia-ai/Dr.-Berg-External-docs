# What single food has been identified as particularly effective in alleviating a wide range of menopausal symptoms?

Menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, and depression are often linked to reduced estrogen and progesterone due to ovarian decline. While many healthcare providers suggest hormone replacement therapy (HRT), itâ€™s important to recognize the role of the adrenal glands, which produce hormones that can compensate for lost ovarian function.

These steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol, primarily sourced from animal products. Incorporating cholesterol-rich foods such as grass-fed butter, egg yolks, shrimp, seafood, and organ meats into your diet can support hormone production and alleviate menopausal symptoms. Unlike plant sources, animal products provide the necessary precursors for synthesizing these hormones effectively.
