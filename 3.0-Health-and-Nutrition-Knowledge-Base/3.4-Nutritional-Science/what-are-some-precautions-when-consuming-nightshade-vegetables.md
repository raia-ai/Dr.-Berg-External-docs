**Precautions for Consuming Nightshade Vegetables**

**Avoid Sprouting or Green Potatoes:** Potatoes that are sprouting or have a greenish tint often contain higher levels of solanine. To reduce solanine exposure, avoid these potatoes and store them in a cool, dark place to prevent sprouting.

**Monitor Your Bodyâ€™s Response:** If you experience increased arthritis symptoms after consuming nightshades, consider tracking your symptoms and discussing them with your healthcare provider. Temporarily removing nightshades from your diet may help determine if they are contributing to your discomfort. Individual responses vary, so personal monitoring is key.
