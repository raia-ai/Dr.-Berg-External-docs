# What physiological changes occur in the body following gallbladder removal surgery?

Your liver makes bile, which acts as a detergent to break down fats. Your gallbladder stores and concentrates bile, so it’s ready for use when you consume dietary fat. You need your bile to be concentrated to fully break down fat. When it isn’t concentrated, you can have incomplete fat digestion. In turn, your risk of developing a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids is increased.

Without a gallbladder, you may experience symptoms such as:

• Floating stool

• Bloating

• Right shoulder pain

• Incomplete toxin removal

• Constipation

• Incomplete conversation of thyroid hormone T4 to T3

• Vitamin deficiencies
