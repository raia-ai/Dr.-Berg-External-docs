# How to balance fat intake for optimum digestive capacity?

### Balancing fat intake on a ketogenic diet is crucial to avoid overwhelming your digestive system and potential issues like keto rash. Start by gradually increasing fat intake to allow your body to adapt and produce sufficient bile for digestion. Consider using medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are easier to digest compared to other fats. These strategies help support digestive health while maximizing the benefits of a ketogenic diet.
