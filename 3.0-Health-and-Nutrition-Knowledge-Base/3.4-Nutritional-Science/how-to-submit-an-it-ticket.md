# How to submit an IT ticket

In order to streamline our processes, we request that everyone use this new Ticketing System.

There were some changes over the past two months, so it is possible that some IT requests may have fallen through the cracks during that transition period.  If you still have any outstanding issues or requests, please enter them into the new ticketing system, if you have not already done so.

**Here is how you access the new ticketing system**:

- [https://drberg.on.spiceworks.com/portal](https://drberg.on.spiceworks.com/portal) - enter your tickets at this portal

- What day and time did the issue occur?

- How long did the issue last?

- How was the issue resolved, if at all?

- Were multiple CRM tabs open at the time of the issue?

- What functions were you attempting to perform? 

- What functions were not working?

- What is the WI#, contact name, and/or email address associated with the issue, if applicable?
