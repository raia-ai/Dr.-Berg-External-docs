# What are the nutritional benefits of coconut?

Coconut is the largest seed on earth. It takes 3 years for it to break down the soil it’s in so that it can grow.

Some people are pretty nervous about consuming coconut oil, based on false information that it is poisonous and can make you fat. It’s not bad for your heart, nor is it a poison. It’s been used for hundreds of years by many cultures without problems. In fact, there are some cultures whose diet is 60 percent coconut-based, whose people are quite healthy.
