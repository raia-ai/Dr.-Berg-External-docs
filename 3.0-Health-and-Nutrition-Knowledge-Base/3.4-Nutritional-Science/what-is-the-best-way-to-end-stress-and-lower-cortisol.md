# What is the best way to end stress and lower cortisol?

We've been told that our environment is dangerous, which causes a lot of stress and anxiety. But, while our environment may be dangerous, it's not as dangerous as many are led to believe—and it's not healthy to keep your attention on this negativity. It's vital to change your viewpoint on your environment and see it in a positive light, as well as filter out some of the negativity you're exposed to. 

Two of the best ways to deal with stress and cortisol:

**1\. Change the viewpoint of your environment and filter out various threats of danger**

• Get space in nature

• Connect with your environment 

**2\. Physically flush out accumulated adrenaline and cortisol** 

• Exercise 

• Do physical work
