# Does hair loss from vitamin D deficiency grow back?

Vitamin D-related hair loss typically grows back once vitamin D levels are restored to healthy levels. Itâ€™s important to note that vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, and it can take up to three months to correct a deficiency with vitamin D supplementation. This explains why it can take a considerable amount of time for hair regrowth to occur.
