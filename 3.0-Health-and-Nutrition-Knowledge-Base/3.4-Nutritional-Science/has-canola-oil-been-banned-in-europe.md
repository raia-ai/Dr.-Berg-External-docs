# Has canola oil been banned in Europe?

**Concerns Over Canola Oil in the European Union**

**Erucic Acid in Canola Oil:**

\- **Health Risks:** Erucic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid found in rapeseed oil (from which canola oil is derived), is linked to serious health concerns. High consumption may cause cardiac lipidosis, a condition where fat accumulates on the heart muscle, impairing cardiac function. It is also associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes.

\- **EU Scrutiny:** Due to these risks, some European nations consider canola oil potentially hazardous. To mitigate these concerns, genetically modified canola plants have been developed to lower erucic acid levels.

**Healthier Alternatives:**

\- **Olive and Coconut Oils:** These oils offer nutritional benefits and are often considered healthier alternatives to traditional cooking oils like rapeseed or sunflower oil.
