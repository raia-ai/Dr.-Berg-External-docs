# What are the natural sources of lutein, and what strategies can be employed to optimize its absorption in the body?

**Lutein benefits your eyes and brain, so include lutein-rich foods in your diet.**

**Leafy Greens: Lutein Powerhouses**

Leafy greens like kale, spinach, collard greens, and Swiss chard are packed with lutein. Just one cup of cooked kale provides over 20 milligrams. Other good sources include yellow and orange peppers, corn, peas, and egg yolks.

**Enhance Absorption with Healthy Fats**

Lutein is fat-soluble, so pair it with healthy fats like avocado, nuts, seeds, or olive oil. For example, add olive oil to kale salad or saut√© spinach in coconut oil for better absorption.

**Tips for Gallbladder Issues**

If you have gallbladder issues or have had it removed, consider supplements with bile salts and digestive enzymes to improve lutein absorption. Always consult with a healthcare expert for personalized advice.
