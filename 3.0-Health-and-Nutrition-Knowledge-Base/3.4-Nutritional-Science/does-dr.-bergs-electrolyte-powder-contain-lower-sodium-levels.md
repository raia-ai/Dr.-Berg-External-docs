# Does Dr. Berg's Electrolyte Powder contain lower sodium levels?

**Key Points:**

- **Ideal Ratio:** A 4:1 potassium-to-sodium ratio supports heart health and blood pressure. Most people get enough sodium from their diet, so the powder has only 40 mg of sodium per 1,000 mg of potassium.

- **Different Needs:** Athletes need more sodium replacement due to sweat loss. Sports drinks have about 500 mg of sodium per 1,000 mg of potassium. Dr. Berg's regular powder is for those without high sodium loss.
