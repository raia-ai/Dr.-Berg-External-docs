Potassium—310g

Depending on what type of coconut milk you get, it’s going to be more or less keto-friendly, but even 8g of carbs aren’t too bad. You just want to make sure you have less than 20g-30g of carbs per day to really get into ketosis.

**Overall, is coconut milk keto-friendly? Yes.** And, it works great in coffee and in all kinds of keto-friendly recipes.

**Coconut water (1 cup):**

Fat—0.5g

Carb—11g

Potassium—600mg

Sodium—282mg

A lot of people consume coconut water for electrolytes because the potassium/sodium ratio is pretty good. I do think the carbs are a bit too high for keto. But, depending on how many other carbs you have in a day, you may still be able to get away with it. It’s definitely much better than juice or soda.
