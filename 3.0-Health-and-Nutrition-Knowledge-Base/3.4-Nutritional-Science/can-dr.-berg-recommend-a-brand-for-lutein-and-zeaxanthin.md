# Can Dr. Berg recommend a brand for Lutein and Zeaxanthin?

**Dr.Berg does not provide a brand recommendation for Lutein and Zeaxanthin.**  

**Supporting Eye Health: Lutein, Zeaxanthin, and Beyond** 

**Contrast sensitivity loss**, an often-overlooked eye problem, can significantly impact vision, particularly in low light, by hindering the ability to differentiate shades of gray. Fortunately, proactive measures and targeted nutrients can help. 

**Carotenoids** like lutein and zeaxanthin are powerful antioxidants that serve as a natural defense system for your eyes. They protect against damage from blue light, environmental chemicals, and complications related to diabetes. As we age, our natural carotenoid levels decline, reducing this crucial protection. While full-spectrum light offers some benefits, it's not a complete solution. 

**Enhancing Retinal Efficiency and Boosting Carotenoids** 

To improve eyesight and enhance retinal efficiency, consider these strategies: 

- **Sunlight Exposure:** Sunlight is vital for overall eye and retinal health. It allows beneficial UV and infrared light into the eye and can help stimulate the eye's natural melatonin production. 

- **Dietary Carotenoids:** Increase your intake of foods rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, such as **egg yolks**. Other excellent sources include leafy green vegetables (spinach, kale), corn, and orange bell peppers. 

**Supplementing for Optimal Eye Health** 

If you opt for **lutein and zeaxanthin supplements**, look for products that provide at least **10 mg of lutein and 2 mg of zeaxanthin** per serving. Research indicates that consistent supplementation with these amounts for 12 weeks can lead to significant improvements in conditions like **macular degeneration** and **contrast sensitivity loss**. 

**Holistic Approaches to Eye Wellness** 

Beyond specific nutrients, a holistic approach to diet and lifestyle plays a crucial role in eye health: 

- **Ancestral Diet & Seed Oils:** As emphasized by Ophthalmologist Dr. Chris Knobbe, removing inflammatory **seed oils** from your diet and adopting an ancestral eating pattern can greatly benefit eyesight. 

- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Incorporate **fatty fish** like salmon, rich in omega-3s, which support overall eye health and help reduce inflammation. **DHA**, a vital omega-3 for both brain and retinal health, is readily available in fish oil and cod liver oil. 

- **Vitamin D:** This vitamin is critical for every part of the eye and may help manage conditions such as **glaucoma, macular degeneration, and retinopathy**. Aim for at least **10,000 IU of vitamin D daily**. (Note: Dr. Berg's Vitamin D3 & K2 products contain MCT oil and ox bile and do not need to be taken with fats.) 

- **Vitamin A:** Essential for healthy vision, particularly **night vision**. 

- **Zinc:** This mineral also plays a supportive role in overall eye health.

**Guidance for Purchasing Lutein and Zeaxanthin Supplements:** 

Since Dr. Berg does not provide a brand recommendation, here's what to look for to ensure you're getting a high-quality Lutein and Zeaxanthin supplement: 

1. **Specific Forms:** Look for **"Lutein"** and **"Zeaxanthin"** on the label.  

2. **Dosage:** Confirm the supplement provides at least **10 mg of Lutein and 2 mg of Zeaxanthin** per serving. Higher concentrations are also available and may be beneficial depending on individual needs. 

3. **Third-Party Testing:** This is crucial. Choose brands that perform and publicly share results from third-party testing for purity, potency, and absence of contaminants (e.g., heavy metals, pesticides). Look for certifications from organizations like NSF International, USP, or ConsumerLab.com. 

4. **"Other Ingredients" and Fillers:** Opt for supplements with minimal and clean "other ingredients." Avoid unnecessary artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, or excessive fillers. 

5. **Reputation and Transparency:** Select well-established brands with a strong reputation for quality and transparent manufacturing practices. Check their website for information on sourcing and testing. 

6. **Absorption Aids:** Some formulations might include healthy fats (like olive oil or sunflower oil) to enhance the absorption of these fat-soluble carotenoids. 

7. **Organic** â€“ Check to see if the company offers an organic product.  

Always consult with a healthcare professional or ophthalmologist before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have pre-existing eye conditions or are taking other medications.
