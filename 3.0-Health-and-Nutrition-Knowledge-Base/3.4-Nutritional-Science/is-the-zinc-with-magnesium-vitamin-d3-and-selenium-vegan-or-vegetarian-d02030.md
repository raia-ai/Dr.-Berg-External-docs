# Is the Zinc with Magnesium, Vitamin D3 and Selenium vegan or vegetarian-Friendly?

Our Zinc with Magnesium, Vitamin D3, and Selenium is not vegan because it contains vitamin D3 derived from lanolin, which comes from sheepâ€™s wool. While no animals are harmed, lanolin is still animal-derived, making it unsuitable for a vegan diet.

It is, however, vegetarian-friendly, as it contains no meat, poultry, fish, or slaughter byproducts, and all other ingredients are plant- or mineral-based.
