# What are the causes for panic attacks?

Panic attacks can be intensely frightening experiences, but understanding their causes and knowing effective remedies can be incredibly helpful.

### **Causes of Panic Attacks**

1. **High Amounts of Stress**: Excessive stress can overburden your adrenal glands (stress-regulating glands), leading to malfunction and an inability to properly manage stress levels.

2. **Respiratory Alkalosis**: This condition occurs when the pH of your lungs becomes too alkaline, often due to hyperventilation. It shares many symptoms with panic attacks, such as hyperventilation, dizziness, and palpitations.

3. **Oxygen Toxicity**: During a panic attack, flooding your lungs with too much oxygen and not enough CO2 can lead to oxygen toxicity, exacerbating the feeling of suffocation and air hunger.

### **Remedies for Panic Attacks**

1. **Control Your Breathing**:

    - Breathe through your nose.

    - Slow down your breathing by counting 3-4 seconds in and 3-4 seconds out.

    - Use diaphragmatic breathing rather than chest breathing.

    - Take soft and gentle breaths.

    - Going outside for more space can also help.

2. **Immediate Stress Reduction**:

    - Slow your breathing (4 seconds in, 4 seconds out).

    - Take vitamin B1 (found in nutritional yeast or benfotiamine supplements).

    - Improve sleep quality and take naps if needed.

    - Engage in long walks outside for 45 to 60 minutes a day.

    - Avoid stress-inducing stimuli, like watching the news.

3. **Diet and Lifestyle**:

    - Following the Healthy KetoÂ® diet may help manage underlying conditions that contribute to panic attacks.

    - Consuming adaptogens can help your body manage stress better.

    - Practice acupressure techniques for immediate relief.

4. **Support Your Nervous System**:

    - Supporting your nervous system through dietary changes, supplements like vitamin B1, and lifestyle adjustments can help manage stress and reduce the frequency of panic attacks.

Remember, while these remedies can be effective for managing panic attacks, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment, especially if panic attacks are frequent or severe. They can help identify any underlying conditions and recommend a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your needs.
