**Magnesium Deficiency: What You Need to Know**

Magnesium plays a vital role in hundreds of bodily processes. But sadly, many of us are deficient in this essential mineral. Let's delve into what magnesium deficiency is, its symptoms, causes, and how to fix it.

**What is Magnesium Deficiency (Hypomagnesemia)?**

Magnesium deficiency occurs when your body doesn't have enough magnesium for optimal function. This mineral is crucial for muscle health, blood sugar control, nerve function, and much more. As Dr. Berg notes, "Almost 50 percent of adults donâ€™t consume enough magnesium." This can lead to serious health problems.

**Signs of Magnesium Deficiency**

Since magnesium is used throughout your body, deficiency symptoms can be wide-ranging:

- Fatigue

- Muscle cramps and weakness

- High blood pressure

- Anxiety, depression, and sleep problems

- Migraine headaches

- Irregular heartbeat

- Numbness or tingling

**Important:** Magnesium deficiency can worsen side effects associated with low vitamin D. Consult a doctor if you suspect a deficiency.

**Causes of Magnesium Deficiency**

- **Poor diet:** Not eating enough magnesium-rich foods is a major culprit.

- **Health conditions:** Issues like Crohn's disease and low stomach acid can hinder magnesium absorption.

- **Medications:** Certain drugs like diuretics and antibiotics can deplete magnesium.

- **Alcohol:** Excessive alcohol intake interferes with your body's ability to absorb magnesium.

**How to Boost Your Magnesium Levels**

1. **Magnesium-Rich Foods:** Focus on these top sources:

    - Pumpkin seeds

    - Spinach

    - Avocados

    - Dark chocolate

    - Almonds

    - Leafy greens

2. **Supplementation:** Opt for highly absorbable forms like magnesium citrate, threonate, glycinate, or taurate. *Avoid* magnesium oxide, sulfate, carbonate, or chloride, as these have low bioavailability and can cause side effects.

This mighty mineral can help with:

- Blood pressure regulation

- Diabetes management

- Migraine prevention
