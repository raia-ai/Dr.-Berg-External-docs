# What are the nutritional benefits of the bone broth?

Bone broth, sometimes called stock, is a liquid made from boiling animal bones and connective tissue. It’s actually a really good thing to consume because you are getting a lot of electrolytes and nutrition without a lot of calories.

People usually eat a lot of muscle from an animal, but not the rest of the animal. They eat a lot of meat from chicken, beef, lamb, and pork. The problem with this is that muscle is very high in methionine, an amino acid, whereas bone broth provides glycine with a different amino acid profile.

**Simple bone broth recipe**

1\. Get three pounds of bones, preferably from a farmer’s market.

2\. Put two gallons of water in a pot, then add the bones.

3\. Add two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and let everything sit for 30 minutes so the acid can help break down the minerals in the bones.

4\. You can add herbs, spices, vegetables and sea salt.

5\. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 12 to 24 hours.

6\. The longer the broth simmers, the more nutrients are extracted. Your goal is to extract minerals, nutrients, collagen and amino acids from the bones.

7\. Let it all cool, then strain the solids from the liquid broth. Store the broth in glass jars.Use it in soups and stews.

**Where to get it**

You can also buy pre-made bone broth in a grocery store or order it online, for example the broth from a company called Kettle and Fire. They use animals that are grass-fed, pasture-raised and organic. They offer several flavors with excellent ingredients and no sugar or fillers. Their products are very keto-friendly.
