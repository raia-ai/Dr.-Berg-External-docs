# What ingredients are considered toxic and I shouldn't consume them?

With just one scan, you’ll see the percentage of sugar, starch, and seed oils lurking in your food. These are the 3 deadly ingredients in ultra-processed junk foods—and my app helps you quickly identify and avoid them.

You'll be surprised at how many “healthy” foods are actually loaded with these harmful ingredients! Don’t be fooled by "zero sugar" labels. Starch is basically hidden sugar, and it’s just as harmful to your body. Most junk foods are packed with toxic ingredients like rancid seed oils, processed starches, and artificial chemicals—yet they lack the essential nutrients your body craves.

Did you know the average person consumes over 100 pounds of modified food starches every year? it’s in everything from baby formula to pet food—and it's a huge part of a teenager’s diet. It's time to take control and make smarter food choices! Junk foods are “dead” foods. They’ve been stripped of vital vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals—and loaded with preservatives, coloring, and MSG. That’s not food; that’s just a bunch of chemicals your body doesn’t know what to do with.
