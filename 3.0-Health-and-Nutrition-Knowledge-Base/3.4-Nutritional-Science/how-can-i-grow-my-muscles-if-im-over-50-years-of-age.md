# How can I grow my muscles if I'm over 50 years of age?

Losing weight should help you live longer, but it’s not always that simple. As you age, it’s vital to maintain a healthy amount of lean muscle mass. Ozempic is very popular for weight loss, but trials have shown that it can cause muscle loss, not just fat loss. One study compared the use of Ozempic to a decade or more of aging. Preserving muscle mass is one of the best things you can do for longevity. Your muscles help regulate your blood sugar and support your metabolism. Sarcopenia is the term for age-related muscle loss. When you develop sarcopenia, your risk for diabetes, immune problems, and your mortality rate increases.

Exercise is the best thing you can do for your muscles. Protein is the raw material for muscle-building, so it’s essential to ensure you’re getting enough and spreading your intake throughout the day. Grass-fed red meat is the best source of protein. Poor sleep drains muscle mass more than poor diet because muscle recovery occurs when you’re sleeping.

In summary, focus on the following as you age:

•Increase lean muscle mass

•Ensure adequate protein intake

•Consume collagen

•Increase magnesium glycinate, vitamin D, zinc, selenium, copper, B vitamins, and coenzyme Q10

•Consume iron from red meat L. reuteri is a microbe with many fascinating benefits and has been shown to increase muscle stem cells. It's helped me gain 5 pounds of muscle mass!
