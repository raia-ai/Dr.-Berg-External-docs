# How can you create a meal with all essential vitamins, and what ingredients ensure a balanced nutritional profile?

**Let's explore the best food sources for essential vitamins and minerals.**

**Protein:** Grass-fed beef, lamb, and goat offer high-quality protein.

**Vitamin A:** While carrots are rich in beta-carotene, the active form is retinol. Liver, fish, cod liver oil, and egg yolks are excellent sources of retinol.

**Iron:** Heme iron from liver and red meat is more readily absorbed than non-heme iron from plants.

**B Vitamins:** Red meat, fish, eggs, cheese, and liver are packed with B vitamins. While grains contain B vitamins, phytic acid can hinder absorption. Nutritional yeast and sunflower seeds are also good sources.

**Collagen:** Consuming skin, bone broth, and organ meats can help increase collagen intake.

**Vitamin D:** Sunlight is the best source, but cod liver oil, sardines, and fatty fish provide vitamin D3. Supplements can be helpful if sun exposure is limited.

**Iodine:** Shellfish, cod, dairy, eggs, sea kelp, and sea salt are rich in iodine.

**Selenium:** Shellfish, organ meat, red meat, and Brazil nuts are excellent sources of selenium.

**Zinc:** Oysters, beef, organ meats, and pumpkin seeds are high in zinc.

**Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Fatty fish is the best source. Algae is a plant-based source of ALA, a precursor to omega-3s.

**Magnesium and Potassium:** While fish and dairy contain some magnesium, pumpkin seeds, greens, and chocolate are better sources. For potassium, focus on greens and avocado."
