# What are the signs of leaky gut present?

**A very thin, single layer of cells acts as a barrier between the inside and the outside of your intestines. The intestines provide protection and absorption of 90 percent of all your nutrients. They also contain a mucus layer, microbes, and 80 percent of your immune system.**

Medical professionals typically recommend increased soluble fiber intake to fix leaky gut when you should actually do the opposite. The carnivore diet is the best leaky gut diet. More fiber creates more inflammation in this situation. Medical professionals also do not point to diet as a primary cause or solution of a leaky gut. Most diseases are triggered by something in your gut, which has everything to do with your diet.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics can also affect gut health. Tampering with your gut microbiome can have serious consequences. You need the microbes in your gut to help you digest, and you don’t want them to become pathogenic.

**Glyphosate is an herbicide sprayed on most GMO and conventional foods patented as an antibiotic, so it has an antibiotic effect on your body. Whole grains are also recommended, but they can wreak havoc on a leaky gut and cause an immune reaction. Seed oils are another major contributor to leaky gut.**

**Here are seven signs of a leaky gut:**

1\. Abdominal pain, cramping

2\. Constipation, diarrhea

3\. Fatigue

4\. Brain fog

5\. Mood issues, anxiety

6\. Skin inflammation

7\. Autoimmune diseases

When you have an autoimmune response, your body considers normal tissues foreign or pathogenic. If your body sees your thyroid as an invader, your thyroid will become inflamed. This is known as Hashimoto’s and starts with inflammation and a leaky gut. The carnivore diet for a few months can help repair a leaky gut by removing the foods causing inflammation. Glutamine and glycine can also help with leaky gut repair.
