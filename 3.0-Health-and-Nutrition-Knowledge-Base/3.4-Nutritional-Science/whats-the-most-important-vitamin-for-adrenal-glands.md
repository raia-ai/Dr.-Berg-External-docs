# What's the most important vitamin for adrenal glands?

The adrenal glands consist of an outer cortex (glandular tissue) and an inner medulla (neurological tissue). The medulla is involved in the fight-or-flight response of the sympathetic nervous system. The adrenal glands help the body adapt to stress. They contain the highest concentration of vitamin C among all glands, which is essential for the functioning of both the cortex and medulla.

Vitamin C acts as a co-factor for catecholamines (neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and adrenaline) and steroid hormones (like cortisol, aldosterone, and androgens), and serves as an antioxidant. Fatigue is a common symptom of both adrenal dysfunction and vitamin C deficiency. Increased stress raises the need for vitamin C, while refined carbohydrates can inhibit its utilization. Excellent sources of vitamin C include sauerkraut, bell peppers, leafy greens, and berries.
