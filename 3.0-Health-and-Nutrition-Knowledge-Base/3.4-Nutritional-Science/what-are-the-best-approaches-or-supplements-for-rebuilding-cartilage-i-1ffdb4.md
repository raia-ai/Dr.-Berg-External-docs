# What are the best approaches or supplements for rebuilding cartilage in the knees and supporting joint health?

To rebuild cartilage in the knees:

1\. **Silica Supplementation**: Silica is effective in stimulating collagen production, which supports joint health, ligaments, tendons, and overall connective tissue.

2\. **Targeted Exercise**: Incorporate exercises recommended by Ben Patrick, such as walking and pulling a sled backwards, to strengthen and rehabilitate the knees.

These strategies can aid in cartilage repair and improve knee function.
