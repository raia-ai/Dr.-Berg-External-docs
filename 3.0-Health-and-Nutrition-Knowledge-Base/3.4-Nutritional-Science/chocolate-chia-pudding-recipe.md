# Chocolate Chia Pudding Recipe

This is another great recipe made with chia seeds. Chia seeds are very nutritious, and it's always great to find new delicious ways to include them in your diet. They are packed with omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids. These fatty acids are especially good for dry skin.

We like this homemade chocolate chia pudding with a lot of chocolate. You can play around with the amount of cocoa powder you put in it to make it more or less "chocolatey." This is a fantastic, easy, and healthy chocolate pudding. Give it a try!

Remember, if you're on the healthy keto diet, this is a perfect little keto dessert—not a snack. 

Chocolate Chia Pudding Recipe: 

**Ingredients:**

30oz almond/coconut milk (or your favorite)

1 tbsp cocoa powder (less if you like milkier chocolate)

½ cup chia seed (or more for thicker texture)

¼ tsp chocolate stevia (The more cocoa you use, the more stevia you'll need.)

1 quart mason jar

**Directions:**

Pour milk into the mason jar, leaving about an inch of room at the top.

Add cocoa powder and stevia. 

Put on top and shake vigorously to mix the cocoa.

Add chia seed and immediately put on top and shake. 

Leave on its side on counter or in fridge for about 10 minutes, and shake again. 

Any cocoa clumps will be breaking down and you need to mix the chia with a good shake.

Then put in fridge for a few hours to thicken.  Enjoy!
