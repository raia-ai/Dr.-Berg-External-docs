# Are ice baths beneficial for your health?

Ice baths can be highly therapeutic, although they can feel quite uncomfortable, especially during the winter months. If you're able to endure the cold, consider supplementing with vitamin B1 (thiamine) to enhance your tolerance to temperature extremes, as a deficiency in B1 can diminish your overall stress resilience.

Engaging in ice baths may significantly reduce inflammation and improve cognitive function. Whether you choose to immerse yourself in a cold pond during winter, take a cold bath, or opt for a cold shower, you can experience the therapeutic benefits of cold exposure.
