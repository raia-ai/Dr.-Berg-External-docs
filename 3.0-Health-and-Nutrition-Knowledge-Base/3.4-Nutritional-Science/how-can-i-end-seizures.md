# How can I end seizures?

**Common triggers of seizures:**

• Fever

• Head injury

• Brain infection

• Choking

• Alcohol

• Drug withdrawal

• Extremely low blood sugar

• Drugs

• Toxins

• Stress

• High blood pressure

Data shows that keto is effective in eliminating seizures by a factor of 50 to 70 percent. But it's important to be on the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. The keto diet for epilepsy also includes more fat than protein. Ketones are a byproduct of fat. Fat and ketones are the primary fuel source that our bodies should run on—not glucose. It's also the preferred fuel source of the brain.

**Top potential benefits of ketones for seizures:**

• They have anticonvulsant properties

• They stabilize the excitability of the neurons

• They modulate neurotransmitters

• They support the brain, including the hippocampus

• They increase the hippocampus's mitochondrial biogenesis

• They protect the brain and neurons against oxidative stress

• They increase the ATP in the neurons to allow them to function better
