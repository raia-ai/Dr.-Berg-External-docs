# Can I consume SlimFast products on keto?

The main issues with SlimFast products are:

1\. **Poor Ingredients**: They contain high-glycemic sugars (maltodextrin, dextrose), GMOs (soy, canola oil, beet sugar), synthetic vitamins, and caffeine, which aren't suitable for a ketogenic diet.

2\. **Snack-Based**: These products are marketed as snacks, leading to frequent blood sugar spikes that hinder weight loss and are incompatible with intermittent fasting.

3\. **Lack of Integrity**: SlimFast still produces products with high sugar content (18g per serving), which contradicts their mission to improve health during an ongoing sugar consumption epidemic.

Overall, SlimFast seems to be capitalizing on market trends for profit, rather than genuinely promoting health.
