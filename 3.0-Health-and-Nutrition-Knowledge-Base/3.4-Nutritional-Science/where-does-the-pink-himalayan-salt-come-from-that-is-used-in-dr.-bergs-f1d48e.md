# Where does the Pink Himalayan Salt come from that is used in Dr. Berg's supplements?

Pink Himalayan salt comes from the Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistanâ€™s Punjab region, about 100 miles south of the Himalayas. This salt was formed over 250 million years ago when ancient ocean beds dried up and were later covered by lava and ice.
