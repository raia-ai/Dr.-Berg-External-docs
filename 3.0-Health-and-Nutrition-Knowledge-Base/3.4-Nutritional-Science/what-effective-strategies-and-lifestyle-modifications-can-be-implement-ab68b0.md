# What effective strategies and lifestyle modifications can be implemented to prevent complications associated with diabetes?

High blood glucose impacts multiple tissues:

1\. Eyes, Arteries, Nervous System, and Kidneys: Affected by glycation, a process where sugar combines with proteins, leading to tissue dysfunction.

2\. A1C Score: Measures glycated hemoglobin, indicating diabetes severity.

3\. Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs): Result from glycation, causing free radical damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress.

Natural inhibitors of glycation include vitamins like benfotiamine, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, tocotrienols (without tocopherols), and Vitamin B6. Other effective inhibitors are alpha lipoic acid, green tea (EGCG), aged garlic, bitter melon, quercetin, curcumin, fasting, and exercise.
