# What is the best treatment for gout, and how do therapies target its underlying causes?

Today, I’m going to share the best remedies for gout. The current medical treatment has side effects, but these natural remedies have little to no side effects.

Gout is a situation where there is a buildup of uric acid. The crystals primarily build up in the big toe, but they can build up in other places as well.

This protocol for gout involves natural remedies that help excrete uric acid and help reduce pain during a gout attack.

It’s important to note that eliminating sugar and alcohol from your diet may help improve gout symptoms. You can also try drinking more water and raising the pH of your urine to help with the symptoms of gout.

The best foods for gout are probiotic foods like sauerkraut and kimchi. Consuming large salads may also be beneficial.

The best natural gout protocol:

1\. White Chinese mulberry extract

2\. Chinese cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia)

3\. Omega-3 fatty acids (cod liver oil)

4\. Alpha-lipoic acid

5\. Devil’s claw or cat’s claw (for pain relief)

6\. Iporuru (for pain relief)

Try this protocol for at least two to three weeks, and I think you’re going to notice a difference.
