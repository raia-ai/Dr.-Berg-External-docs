# What are the most effective remedies for addressing dry and wrinkly skin, and how can these treatments improve skin hydration and elasticity?

Anything you put on the skin gets directly absorbed into your body.

**Because your skin is mainly composed of protein and fat, a low-fat diet is one of the worst things for your skin. Seed oils, synthetic starches, and synthetic sugars also have detrimental effects on your skin health.**

Seed oils like corn oil, cottonseed oil, canola oil, soy oil, safflower oil, and sunflower oil are very high in omega-6 fatty acids. These highly processed oils are deodorized and decolorized and are made using solvents like hexane. They can get lodged into your membranes and can stay there for two and a half to three years.

When you consume too many omega-6 fatty acids (seed oils) and not enough omega-3 fatty acids, you develop dry, red, flaky skin. Your skin may also start to look older.

**Grass-fed beef tallow is very similar to your skin’s natural sebum and will not oxidize the skin or cause inflammation. Tallow contains vitamins A, D, E, and K and the compound CLA, which helps the skin retain moisture.**

**Tallow softens the skin and leaves it with a healthy glow.** The nutrients in tallow can also help eliminate dark spots and wrinkles. Tallow is fifty percent saturated fat and contains oleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, and linoleic acid—all of which have positive benefits for your skin. For better skin, remove seed oils from the diet, apply tallow to the skin, and consume more omega-3 fatty acids. You should notice improvement in your skin in a matter of weeks.
