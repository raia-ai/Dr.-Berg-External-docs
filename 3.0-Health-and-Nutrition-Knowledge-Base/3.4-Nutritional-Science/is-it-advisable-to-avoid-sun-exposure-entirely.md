# Is it advisable to avoid sun exposure entirely?

There has been an association between vitamin D insufficiency and autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and at least 17 different cancers.

Vitamin D is intimately involved in over 2,000 of our genes and vital for proper immune function. It’s virtually impossible to get enough vitamin D from your diet. Only 5% to 10% of vitamin D comes from diet, and that’s only if you eat plenty of fatty fish, organ meats, and egg yolks. Around 90% to 95% percent of your vitamin D comes from the sun. Every year, there are 5,125 deaths from sun exposure and 1,684,677 deaths from lack of sun. For every death from sun exposure, there are 329 deaths from lack of sun.

The current American Dermatology Association recommendation is to stay out of the sun and use sunblock. Yet, in the early 1900s, the sun was used to treat illnesses like tuberculosis and asthma. In 1935, 1 out of 1500 people developed melanoma. By 2014, 1 in 50 people had developed melanoma, despite the fact that people are spending significantly less time outside. This shows that the sun protects you from melanoma. In fact, 75% of all melanomas are located in areas not typically exposed to the sun.

Fifty-four percent of the sun's rays are infrared light. Infrared light protects against cancer, stimulates melatonin, and also generates ATP. Vitamin D and melatonin protect the mitochondria. Both are stimulated by exposure to the sun. Aim to get a moderate amount of sun exposure to avoid burning and support your health.
