# How low-calorie diets and intermittent fasting affect metabolism?

**Low-calorie diets:**

• Slow your metabolism 

• Raises your set point (you can’t lose weight once you hit a certain point that’s typically high)

• Decrease muscle

• Increase cravings and hunger

• Don’t put a person in fat-burning 

• Ignore how food triggers certain hormones 

• Ignore the nutrients in the calories 

**Intermittent fasting:**

• Speeds up metabolism 

• Lowers your set point (allows your weight to go down)

• Improves muscle by triggering growth hormone 

• Decreases cravings and hunger 

• Puts a person in fat-during 

• Considers the hormone aspects, especially insulin 

• Promotes eating nutrient-dense foods when eating

**Low-calorie diets focus on restricting calories, but intermittent fasting focuses on restricting the frequency of eating. Intermittent fasting doesn’t lower your calories when you do eat.** 

**With intermittent fasting, when you do eat a meal, you want it to have healthy fats, a moderate amount of protein, and nutrient-dense vegetables. Having a nice big meal will help you switch over to fat-burning when you’re fasting and help make it easier to fast. A great form of intermittent fasting is having two meals a day without snacks.**
