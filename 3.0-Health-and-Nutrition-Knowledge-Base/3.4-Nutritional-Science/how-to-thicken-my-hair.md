# How to thicken my hair?

The good bacteria in your gut make biotin. This is why a common side effect of antibiotics is hair problems. When you stop taking biotin, you may notice that the problem comes right back, so it’s vital to address gut health when dealing with biotin deficiency. Liver and egg yolks are the best sources of biotin. Nutritional yeast and salmon also contain biotin. Alcohol, raw eggs, and magnesium deficiency can interfere with biotin absorption. Zinc and copper are essential for biotin absorption and function.

Retinol, the active form of vitamin A, is only found in animal foods. Liver and egg yolks are the best sources, but you can also find vitamin A in shellfish and cod liver oil. Vitamin A helps control sebum, so it’s very beneficial for thick, shiny hair! For healthy hair, reduce your omega-6 fat intake and increase your omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids are vital for healthy hair. Fish oil and cod liver oil are excellent sources of omega-3s.

L. reuteri is a microbe missing in 96% of the population. It increases sebum, which makes hair shiny, and it may also increase hair growth. Copper is used in many different enzymes, including the enzyme that helps prevent iron accumulation in your tissues. Iron is vital for hair growth, but we need the right balance. NPK fertilizer in our foods is a common cause of copper deficiency. If the grass is deficient in copper, the animals that eat the grass will also be deficient. Animals with copper deficiency have very dull hair. If this can happen to sheep and cows, it can definitely happen to us! Overconsumption of iron, often from fortified wheat products, can lock up your copper and contribute to copper deficiency. Other contributors to copper deficiency include high fructose corn syrup and high zinc intake.
