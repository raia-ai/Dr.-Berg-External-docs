# What are the most effective remedies for managing and reducing teeth grinding?

**Grinding your teeth can lead to issues like:**

• Excessive wearing of the teeth

• Teeth pain

• Headaches

• Jaw spasms

People who smoke, drink alcohol, or take SSRIs have a higher risk of teeth grinding (bruxism). There are a few things involved in teeth grinding at night, but it seems to be largely related to the autonomic nervous system.

Bruxism is also associated with a certain variation in genetics. The gene involved is the receptor gene for serotonin. If you have this variation, you’ll have to work harder to increase the precursors of serotonin to help build it up.

**Bruxism can also be triggered by various things, including:**

• Stress events

• Trauma

• Excess caffeine consumption

**The best natural remedies for teeth grinding:**

1\. Vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast)

2\. Vitamin D3
