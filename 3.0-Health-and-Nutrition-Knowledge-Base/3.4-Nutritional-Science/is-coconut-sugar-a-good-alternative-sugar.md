# Is coconut sugar a good alternative sugar?

Coconut sugar is not a good alternative. The worst sugar is agave nectar. But coconut sugar has just too much sugar. So you're going to have to do something like xylitol or erythritol as your sugar alternative, or stevia or monk fruit, because these other sugars just are going to blow your sugars out.
