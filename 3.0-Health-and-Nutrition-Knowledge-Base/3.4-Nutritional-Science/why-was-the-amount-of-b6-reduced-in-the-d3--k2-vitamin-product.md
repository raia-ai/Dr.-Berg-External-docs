# Why was the amount of B6 reduced in the D3 & K2 Vitamin product?

In March 2024, Dr. Berg reduced the amount of B6 in the D3 & K2 Vitamin from 30mg (1765% DV) to 3.4mg (200% DV) after overwhelming customer concern with the high amount of B6 in the original formulation. While the amount of B6 has been reduced, one capsule of D3 & K2 provides 200% of the recommended daily value.
