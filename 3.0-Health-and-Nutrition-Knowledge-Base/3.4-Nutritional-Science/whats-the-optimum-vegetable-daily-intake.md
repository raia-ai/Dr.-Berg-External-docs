### **The Role of Vegetables in Nourishment**

Vegetables are nature's multivitamins, packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that keep our bodies functioning at their best. They're rich in fiber, which aids in digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut microbiome.

Eating various vegetables ensures you get a broad spectrum of nutrients, each vital in maintaining overall health.

### **How Much Is Enough?**

The recommended daily amount of salad or vegetables is about 7 to 10 cups, with one cup of salad equivalent to one ounce. This may seem like a lot, but it's achievable when you make veggies the star of your meals and snacks.

Aim to fill half your plate with vegetables at each meal and incorporate them into snacks like carrot sticks with hummus or celery with nut butter. By prioritizing vegetables, you'll quickly reach your daily quota and reap the numerous health benefits they provide.
