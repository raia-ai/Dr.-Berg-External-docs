# What approaches can I take to manage ulcers for both my child and myself, particularly in the context of acid reflux?

For managing ulcers and acid reflux, the key is dietary changes. Reduce sugar and refined flour intake, and incorporate salads with radish or broccoli sprouts, which contain sulforaphane to combat H. pylori. Healing can be supported with cabbage juice and zinc.

Avoid acidifiers like apple cider vinegar until the ulcer heals, which can take several months. If intense burning occurs, a small amount of baking soda can provide relief without worsening the condition. Proper diet and careful management are crucial for recovery.
