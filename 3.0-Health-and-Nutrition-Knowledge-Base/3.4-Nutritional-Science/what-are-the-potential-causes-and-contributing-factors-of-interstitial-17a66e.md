# What are the potential causes and contributing factors of interstitial cystitis?

Interstitial cystitis is a condition where there is some kind of inflammation in your bladder that creates a lot of discomfort. This can be resolved by following a healthy diet and lifestyle.

Symptoms:

- Painful bladder

- Urgency to urinate

- Painful urination

Getting your body healthy

This condition has an unknown cause. And there is no officially stated remedy for it. However, I believe that if you become more healthy overall, this condition should resolve.

**Potential Cause #1: Low estrogen**

If you have low estrogen it can cause bladder issues. This is because estrogen itself influences the sensation of urination in your bladder. Low estrogen can be caused by menopause or some kind of issue with the ovaries.

**Potential Cause #2: obstruction (due to fibroids or enlarged prostate)**

If you canâ€™t empty your bowels there could be some obstruction or blockage in the bladder; it could be a fibroid (scar tissue) or caused by an enlarged prostate.

**Potential Cause #3: ANS dysfunction**

The ANS, or autonomic nervous system, has to do with your general body response during periods of stress. It also relaxes your body and many of its organs during a rest period. ANS affects your bladder function and nerves. If you have dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, you may have bladder problems including urine retention.
