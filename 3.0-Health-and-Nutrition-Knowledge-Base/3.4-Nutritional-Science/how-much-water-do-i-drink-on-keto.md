# How much water do I drink on Keto?

Some people drink about 2 to 3 cups of water a day. Your body adjusts to maintain a natural balance. Just make sure only to drink when you’re thirsty.

But when fasting, you’re losing glycogen. With the glycogen loss (stored sugar), you’re also going to lose a lot of fluid. This fluid isn’t just water. It’s a combination of water, electrolytes and salts – which need to go back into the body.

It would be a good idea for someone to consume between 2 and 3 liters of water per day while fasting. This quantity could also help prevent kidney stones. You would want to be sure to add electrolytes and sea salt. Forgetting electrolytes and sea salt can potentially lead to keto fatigue, keto flu and overall weakness.

Make sure to consume water when you are thirsty only, to avoid overhydration with its problems.
