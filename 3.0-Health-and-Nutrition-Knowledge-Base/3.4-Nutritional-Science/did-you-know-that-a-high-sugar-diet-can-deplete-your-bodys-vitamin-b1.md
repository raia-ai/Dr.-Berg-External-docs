**Why is this a problem?**

A vitamin B1 deficiency can lead to:

- **Restless legs syndrome:** This is because a lack of B1 can cause fluid retention and lactic acid buildup.

- **Complications related to diabetes:** Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are linked to B1 deficiency.

**Could you be low in vitamin B1?**

Watch out for these warning signs:

- **Nervous system issues:** Nervous tension, irritability, restlessness, brain fog, confusion, personality changes, low tolerance to stress, loss of coordination

- **Physical symptoms:** Air hunger, numbness in feet and/or fingertips, hand tremors, low pulse rate, headaches, constipation, insomnia

**How to boost your B1 levels:**

- **Diet:** Include these excellent sources of B1 in your diet:

    - Pork, beef, and organ meats

    - Eggs

    - Fish

    - Nuts

    - Unfortified nutritional yeast

- **Supplements:** Consider these forms of B1, especially if you have blood sugar concerns:

    - **Allithiamine:** A fat-soluble form that easily enters the brain.

    - **Benfotiamine:** Another fat-soluble form that may be beneficial for blood sugar regulation.

If you suspect you have a vitamin B1 deficiency, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.
