# What is the worst food for my teeth?

Citric acid, whether natural or synthetic, poses a threat to dental health by binding with calcium in teeth, weakening enamel, and creating an acidic environment. Minimize exposure by rinsing with water after consuming citric acid-containing foods, opting for products without added citric acid, and using toothpaste free from this ingredient. Prioritize smart food choices to protect your smile!
