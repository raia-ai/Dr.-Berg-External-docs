# What foods are most effective for supporting the body's healing and repair processes, and how do their nutrients aid recovery?

Other types of protein, like eggs and salmon, are beneficial—but red meat is the best to support healing. Of all the things needed for the repair or healing process, amino acids are among the most important.

**Red meat is more bioavailable and is a more concentrated source of amino acids than other types of protein. It also contains more iron, magnesium, zinc, B vitamins, vitamin K, and omega-3 fatty acids than eggs.**

This doesn’t include processed meat from factory farms. It’s crucial to get high-quality grass-fed, grass-finished red meat.

**Red meat also contains four important additional nutrients for healing, repair, and recovery:**

1\. Carnitine

2\. Creatine

3\. Carnosine

4\. Coenzyme Q10

**People who have difficulty digesting red meat typically have low stomach acid. Even if you don’t like the taste of red meat, it may be because you have low stomach acid. Betaine hydrochloride may be beneficial to help strengthen your stomach acid. You can try taking three to five betaine hydrochloride supplements before a meal for about one month. However, if you tend to have excess iron, red meat may not be for you. Instead, you could try consuming more poultry or eggs.**
