# What are some ways to manage Sjögren’s syndrome?

While I don't have personal experience with it, autoimmune diseases can have a significant impact on the body, affecting connective tissues, skin, joints, and digestion. One potential approach to managing symptoms is to maintain high levels of vitamin D, which may help reduce inflammation and support remission of certain symptoms.

Additionally, adopting a healthy lifestyle through a ketogenic diet combined with intermittent fasting may promote overall health. Intermittent fasting, in particular, has been shown to support immune system healing.
