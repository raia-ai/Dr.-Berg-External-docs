# What's the worst ingredient in the world?

This section explores the research of Dr. Chris Knobbe, an ophthalmologist who has studied seed oils and their potential connection to health problems.

**The Shift from Fat to Seed Oils:**

While sugar intake remained relatively stable between 1922 and 1987, obesity rates skyrocketed by 600%. During this same period, vegetable oil consumption soared from 78 to 497 calories per person per day. Today, the average American gets roughly a third of their daily calories from seed oils.

**Seed Oils and Metabolic Issues:**

Dr. Knobbe's research suggests that seed oils might contribute to diabetes by hindering the body's ability to burn fuel efficiently due to mitochondrial dysfunction.

Seed oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids, which can accumulate in fat tissue, cell membranes, and mitochondria. These polyunsaturated fats may promote oxidation and inflammation within the body. Additionally, seed oils might lack essential nutrients, forcing the body to use its reserves, leading to deficiencies.

**From Industrial Uses to Our Plates:**

Interestingly, cottonseed oil, the first widely used seed oil, was originally intended for industrial applications like machinery and lamps. Its introduction into food aimed to replace butter and lard, which ultimately proved successful from a commercial standpoint. By 2010, seed oil consumption in the US had reached a staggering 80 grams per person daily.

**Reducing Seed Oil Intake:**

The simplest way to minimize seed oil consumption is to limit processed foods and focus on whole, unprocessed options like meat, eggs, dairy, and fresh produce. These foods naturally contain a variety of essential nutrients.

While Dr. Knobbe's research raises interesting questions, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized dietary advice.
