# This 1 Thing Can Replace Our Entire Medical System

Fasting has gained significant attention for its potential to address the root cause of many chronic illnesses: insulin resistance. By abstaining from food for a period, you can effectively "reset" your body's metabolism and improve its sensitivity to insulin.

**How Fasting Works:**

- **Activates Survival Genes:** Fasting triggers survival mechanisms within your body, prompting it to utilize stored fat and ketones for energy instead of relying solely on glucose.

- **Ketosis:** It typically takes around 3 days of fasting to enter ketosis, a metabolic state where your body efficiently burns fat for fuel.

- **Insulin Sensitivity:** Fasting enhances your cells' responsiveness to insulin, allowing for better blood sugar regulation.

- **Cortisol Levels:** Contrary to popular belief, fasting does not elevate cortisol (stress hormone) levels.

**Types of Fasting:**

- **Water Fasting:** Consuming only water during the fasting period.

- **Dry Fasting:** Abstaining from both food and water. Dry fasting may offer additional benefits like accelerated weight loss and enhanced detoxification, but it should be approached with caution and under appropriate guidance.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Listen to Your Body:** Don't force yourself to fast longer than feels comfortable. Pay attention to your body's hunger cues.

- **Nutrient Intake:** If you experience hair loss or menstrual irregularities while fasting, it could indicate a lack of protein. Prioritize high-quality protein sources like grass-fed red meat, which provides essential amino acids, trace minerals, and B vitamins.

- **Essential Minerals:** Ensure adequate intake of sea salt, magnesium (around 400mg), and zinc (around 50mg) to support overall health during fasting.

- **Hydration and Sleep:** Stay well-hydrated (especially during water fasting) and prioritize getting enough sleep.

**Disclaimer:** While fasting can offer significant health benefits, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any fasting regimen, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications.
