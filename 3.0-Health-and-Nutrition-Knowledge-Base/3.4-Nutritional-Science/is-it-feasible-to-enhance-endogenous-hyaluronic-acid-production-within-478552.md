# Is it feasible to enhance endogenous hyaluronic acid production within the body through dietary, pharmacological, or lifestyle interventions?

You have probably seen ads for creams and injections intended to restore hyaluronic acid. Some clinics specialize in these types of cosmetic procedures.

Many people topically apply creams or take hyaluronic acid orally. Let's address whether it can be absorbed and offer hyaluronic acid benefits if taken orally.

Though some claim you can't absorb oral hyaluronic acid, this isn't true. You might not absorb much, more like 2.5%. However, even that small percentage can be just enough to help replace what you are naturally losing as you get older.

There was once a show hosted by Connie Chung focusing entirely on this topic. During the segment, she interviewed many centenarians in a Japanese village who were still very active and working.

The villagers credited their longevity and hyaluronic acid benefits to a special type of root they consumed regularly, one that was incredibly high in this youth-promoting substance. Foods high in hyaluronic acid can provide an extra boost.
