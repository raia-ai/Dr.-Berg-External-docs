# What brand of melatonin does Dr. Berg recommend?

**Melatonin: Beyond Just Sleep** 

While Dr. Berg doesn't have a specific brand recommendation for **melatonin**, it's important to understand that its benefits extend far beyond just being a sleep aid. 

It's true that your body naturally produces melatonin, and you can support these levels through diet and lifestyle. We'll get into those tips shortly. However, I'm not recommending that you take melatonin supplements unless you're using it for a specific condition, as your body is designed to make its own. 

**Surprising Benefits of Melatonin** 

Here are 12 lesser-known but significant benefits of melatonin you should be aware of: 

1. Acts as a **potent antioxidant**. 

2. **Improves the immune system**. 

3. **Reduces inflammation**. 

4. **Decreases headaches**. 

5. Helps **fight against cancer**. 

6. Helps **protect your brain and memory**. 

7. **Decreases Luteinizing Hormone (LH)**, which is linked to Alzheimer's disease. 

8. **Improves GERD symptoms**. 

9. **Lowers anxiety**. 

10. Helps **fight depression**. 

11. **Stabilizes blood sugars**. 

For the therapeutic benefit of lowering Luteinizing Hormone, Dr. Berg suggests a higher dosage: **75 mg for women and 125 mg for men**. 

**How to Naturally Boost Your Melatonin Levels** 

You can significantly improve your body's natural melatonin production through these lifestyle adjustments: 

- **Avoid light at night:** This includes bright overhead lights. 

- **Get plenty of sun and vitamin D during the day:** Exposure to natural light during the day helps regulate your circadian rhythm. 

- **Decrease your exposure to blue light in the evening:** This means limiting screens (phones, tablets, computers, TVs) before bed or using blue light filters. 

- **Avoid eating before bed:** Give your digestive system a break before sleep. 

- **Get your glucose under control:** A low-carb keto diet can be very helpful here. 

- **Avoid TV before bed:** The light and stimulation can interfere with melatonin production.  

**Best Practices for Buying Melatonin Supplements** 

If you do decide to purchase a melatonin supplement for a specific condition, here are some best practices to ensure you're getting a quality product: 

1. **Look for "Pharmaceutical Grade" or "USP Verified":** These designations indicate that the product meets strict quality, purity, and potency standards. 

2. **Check the Dosage:** Melatonin dosages can range widely. Be sure the product offers the specific dosage you're looking for, especially if you're aiming for higher therapeutic amounts. 

3. **Read the "Other Ingredients":** Opt for products with minimal fillers, artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives. Simpler is often better. 

4. **Reputable Brand:** Choose well-known, transparent brands that are clear about their sourcing and manufacturing processes. 

5. **Third-Party Testing:** Some brands will have their products tested by independent third-party labs to verify purity and accuracy of ingredients. This information is often available on their website or the product label.
