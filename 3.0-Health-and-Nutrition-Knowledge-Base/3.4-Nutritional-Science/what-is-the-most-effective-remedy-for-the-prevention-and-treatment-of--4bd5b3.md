# What is the most effective remedy for the prevention and treatment of dental plaque and tartar accumulation?

Today, I’m going to show you how to make natural toothpaste to help eliminate tartar and prevent it from coming back.

Tartar is a calcified, pale, yellow, hard substance that accumulates on your teeth. It can lead to gingivitis as well as bad breath. Tartar is made up of a colony of bacteria that survives in something called a biofilm.

Biofilms contain bacteria, fungi, yeast, and candida. Tartar biofilms ferment carbohydrates in your mouth and release lactic acid, which can leach away your calcium and cause cavities.

Many ancient cultures used natural toothpaste, but these recipes were very abrasive and wore down the teeth.

This homemade toothpaste recipe is far more gentle yet still effective at removing plaque.

To make this toothpaste, combine the following ingredients:

•3 drops of either clove oil, peppermint oil, or cinnamon oil, or a pinch of turmeric powder

•¼ teaspoon hydrogen peroxide

•¼ teaspoon baking soda

•¼ teaspoon raw honey or manuka honey

•½ cup water

Mix these ingredients and brush your teeth with the mixture using a soft bristle toothbrush twice per day.

Vitamin K2 has also shown promising results in removing and preventing tartar buildup.
