# What are the symptoms of too high sugar consumption?

Excessive sugar intake can have surprising effects beyond the well-known issues like fatigue and cavities:

1\. Reduced collagen: Sugar inhibits collagen production, leading to premature aging and skin issues.

2\. Chronic white tongue: Sugar can cause candida overgrowth, resulting in persistent white tongue.

3\. Chronic sinus problems: Sugar promotes fungal growth, contributing to ongoing sinus issues.

4\. Red or pink gums: Indicates potential vitamin C deficiency due to sugar interference with absorption.

5\. Low testosterone: Elevated sugar levels can lower testosterone, affecting libido and muscle growth.

6\. Susceptibility to infections: Sugar weakens the immune system, increasing infection risk.

7\. High adrenaline levels: Sugar disrupts cellular energy, prompting increased adrenaline production.
