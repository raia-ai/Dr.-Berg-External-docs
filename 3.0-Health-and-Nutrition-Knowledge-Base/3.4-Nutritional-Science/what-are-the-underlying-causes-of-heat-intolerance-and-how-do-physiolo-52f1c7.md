# What are the underlying causes of heat intolerance, and how do physiological, hormonal, and medical factors contribute to an individual’s inability to tolerate heat?

Heat intolerance is a condition where you feel overheated easily when you’re in a warm environment. This often includes excessive sweating, dizziness, or weakness.

**Cause 1: Lack of vitamin B1**

Heat intolerance roots in a vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. If you’re on a low-carb diet, you simply need to increase your vitamin B1 intake. If you’re on a high-carb diet, carbs and sugar can deplete B vitamins, especially B1.
