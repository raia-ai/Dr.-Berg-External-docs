# What are the effects of iron overload?

In the United States, many pastas, breads, and cereals go through a process of iron fortification.

A diet high in fortified grains can often lead to a very high iron intake. Too much iron can have negative implications on your health.

**Iron is attracted to damaged tissues of the brain, nerve, eye, liver, and heart. If you have insulin resistance or any issues with damaged tissues, iron targets these tissues and oxidizes them. It can also oxidize the fat layer around your brain and nervous system.**

Metals like iron accumulate in the body, and you don’t have the ability to remove them. Your body can only get rid of 1.2 mg of excess iron per day. Many iron supplements contain a copious amount of iron, but you only need 8 mg of iron per day to prevent a deficiency.
All microbes need iron to survive—both good bacteria and pathogens need iron. Probiotics are incredibly efficient in regulating excess iron. The good bacteria in your gut utilizes excess iron in your body.
**The best way to rid your body of excess iron is through a process called chelation—binding with a metal or mineral to remove it from the body.**
Phytic acid is one of the best chelators. IP-6(inositol hexaphosphate) is a potent antioxidant that combines phytic acid and the B-vitamin inositol. IP-6 is an amazing chelator that inhibits the oxidative effects of iron. Dietary sources of phytic acid include vegetables, nuts, and seeds.
