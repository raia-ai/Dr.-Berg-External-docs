# What is glutathione and how can I make sure I get enough amount of it without taking supplements?

**Glutathione is an important antioxidant present in all of your cells. It helps detoxify heavy metals and protects against free radical damage and oxidation. Your body makes glutathione! You should only take a supplement if you have Tylenol poisoning. Tylenol depletes glutathione and puts your liver at risk for damage. If you’re dealing with Tylenol poisoning, you may be given an NAC supplement, a precursor to help build up your glutathione.**

**Try the following tips to ensure that you’re getting enough glutathione without taking a supplement:**

1\. Get enough glycine. Consume organ meats, the skin from meat and fish, bone broth, and gelatin.

2\. Ensure adequate B vitamin intake. Avoid synthetic B vitamins. Meat is a great source of B12 and consuming organ meats and dark leafy greens will help add folate to your diet.

3\. Get plenty of vitamin C from sources like sauerkraut and leafy greens.

4\. Get enough sleep.

5\. Do not over-exercise. Limit high-intensity exercise to twice a week.

6\. Reduce stress. Adaptogens, going for a walk, listening to music, and even physical labor can reduce stress.

7\. Consume sufficient protein with plenty of calories.

8\. Increase carb intake to 50 grams per day.

9\. Consume cruciferous vegetables.

10\. Consume seafood for trace minerals like zinc and selenium.
