# What are the most important benefits of betaine hydrochloride?

Betaine hydrochloride is an acidic vitamin-like amino acid that has excellent benefits for your digestive tract. It is found naturally in certain foods like beets, spinach, beef and shrimp. It increases your stomach acidity (lowers your stomachâ€™s pH).

One of the functions of strong acid is to prevent pathogens from moving from the stomach into your small intestine and then multiplying out of control. Your stomach acidity should be between 1.5 and 3, which is highly acidic. Betaine hydrochloride is a great remedy for increasing stomach acidity, which will help with the absorption of all the other nutrients in your diet.
