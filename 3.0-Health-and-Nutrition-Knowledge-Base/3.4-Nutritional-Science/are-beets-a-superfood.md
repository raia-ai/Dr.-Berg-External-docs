# Are beets a superfood?

Yes, beets are a bona fide superfood. Theyâ€™re a rich source of vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, and antioxidants. Beets are one of the few food sources of betalains, a group of potent health-promoting phytochemicals.

Regularly consuming beets supports healthy blood pressure, lowers your risk of heart and liver disease, promotes healthy vision, and may protect you from the development of colon cancer.
