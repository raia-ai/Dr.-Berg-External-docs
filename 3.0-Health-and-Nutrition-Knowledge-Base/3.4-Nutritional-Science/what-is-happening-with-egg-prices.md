# What is happening with egg prices?

Dr. Baker points out the similarities between the current bird flu outbreak and the COVID-19 outbreak of 2020. The media creates fear, followed by a pandemic, to gain control. This eventually leads to civil rights violations, including lockdowns and work bans.

Next, people are coerced into taking profitable yet toxic vaccines as a countermeasure against the outbreak. We are witnessing this once again with the current bird flu outbreak. There are two labs in the US: the Southeast Poultry Research Lab, funded by the USDA, and the University of Wisconsin Veterinary School, which conducts gain-of-function research on viruses. This involves manipulating a naturally occurring virus to make it more deadly and able to jump from species to species.

Farmers are encouraged to perform PCR tests on their flocks, which are known for false positives. If any of their birds test positive for bird flu, they are paid to slaughter their entire flock. The increase in egg prices is not due to bird deaths from bird flu but rather the mass slaughter of birds. Over 1.25 billion taxpayer dollars have been used to fund this mass slaughter. Ultimately, the goal is to mass vaccinate chickens in the food supply against bird flu.

Gain-of-function research is dangerous and must stop! We can also help combat this problem by purchasing eggs from smaller farmers at farmerâ€™s markets.
