# Why are the B vitamins in the Natural B1+ Only 25 %?

Allithiamine is the main ingredient and primary source of thiamin in Natural B1+. Since it does not have an established daily value, we cannot state a DV for the ingredient on the label.

Allithiamine is a unique lipid-soluble form of thiamin that is far more bioavailable than its water-soluble, often synthetic counterpart. We source the highest quality allithiamine naturally extracted from raw organic garlic.

Only a minimal amount of the complete B vitamin complex, 25% of the daily value in our product, is needed to help with the bioavailability and efficacy of allithiamine. These B vitamins work synergistically with 20 milligrams of magnesium to maximize the absorption rate of allithiamine.
