# What are the effects of warfarin, and how can we correct blood viscosity naturally?

Warfarin, an anticoagulant that inhibits vitamin K1 to prevent clotting, is commonly prescribed for heart conditions like heart attacks and arrhythmias. However, it necessitates restrictions on vitamin K-rich foods such as leafy greens. Natural alternatives for blood thinning include garlic, known for its anticoagulant properties, fish oils rich in omega-3 fatty acids that reduce clotting, and vitamin E (tocotrienols), which also help to thin the blood. It's important to consult a healthcare provider before altering medications or diet plans. Newer anticoagulants allow for more flexibility in vitamin K intake, offering additional options for managing blood viscosity alongside medical guidance.
