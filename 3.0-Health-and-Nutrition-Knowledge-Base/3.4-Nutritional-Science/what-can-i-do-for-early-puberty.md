# What can I do for early puberty?

**It ultimately comes from exposure to Xenoestrogens which is external so your body isn’t making it because it's coming from the environment.**

Chemicals that mimic estrogen would be BPA(Plastic Bags), PCB(Industrial Waste), in the food supply, and more. The main one you should know about is ZERANOL (Potent Estrogen) which is a growth hormone that they inject into cattle. It’s actually banned in Europe but it is still used in the U.S. and is 100,000 times stronger than BPA. When you eat meats or dairy you should do organic, even though it might be a little more expensive you save more if you're doing intermittent fasting by eating a few times a day to invest in higher quality food.
