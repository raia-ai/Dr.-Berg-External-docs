# Why is there a warning on the Canadian version of the Electrolyte Powder?

The statement “Not to be used following vigorous exercise” is required on the Canadian Electrolyte Powder label (NPN 80106216) because of the high potassium content (1,000 mg per serving).

 According to Health Canada’s product licensing standards, when a supplement provides potassium at or above certain thresholds (typically ≥975 mg per day), this specific caution is required. The reason is that potassium levels in the body can shift significantly after vigorous exercise or dehydration, and individuals may be more susceptible to electrolyte imbalances under these conditions, especially if they have kidney issues or are taking medications that affect potassium levels.

The warning is part of Health Canada’s broader safety guidance for high-potency electrolyte products, aimed at helping reduce the risk of complications such as low blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, or muscle weakness when potassium is consumed inappropriately during recovery.
