# What is the most valuable vitamin in handling of high blood pressure?

Vitamin D is the most important vitamin for the inside of the arteries, yet itâ€™s often ignored in cases of hypertension. Ninety percent of hypertension is considered essential, which means the cause is unknown. However, I believe it's likely linked to vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is vital in supporting and protecting the endothelial layer of your arteries.

The benefits of vitamin D for your arteries include:

1\. Potent anti-inflammatory effects

2\. Potent antioxidant effects

3\. Increased nitric oxide

Nitric oxide keeps the arteries in a state of vasodilation and relaxation. Without enough nitric oxide, the arteries become tight, and blood pressure rises. When the endothelial layer of the artery becomes dysfunctional, you no longer produce nitric oxide. You won't absorb much calcium if you don't have enough vitamin D. This can cause your parathyroid hormone to increase to remove calcium from the bone and put it into the blood. If you are chronically low in vitamin D, the parathyroid hormone will continue to rob calcium from the bone, creating osteoporosis.

Many doctors do not recommend large doses of vitamin D in fear of vitamin D toxicity. Clinical data does not support vitamin D toxicity! Dr. Bruce Hollis, a pioneer in vitamin D research, has personally never seen a case. Vitamin K2 can help remove calcium from the arteries and put it into the teeth and bones. Magnesium regulates excess calcium and helps to prevent cardiovascular problems. Vitamin D protects your arteries by decreasing inflammation and supporting the vascular cells. Vitamin D, magnesium, and K2 can help prevent calcium from developing in the wrong places, helping to prevent high blood pressure. Aim for 30,000 IU of vitamin D daily if you have high blood pressure.
