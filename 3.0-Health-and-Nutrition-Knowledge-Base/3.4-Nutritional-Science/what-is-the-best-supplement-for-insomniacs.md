# What is the best supplement for insomniacs?

**Here is what you can do if you can't sleep at night:**

1\. Sleep on the right side - the liver maybe is enlarged and compress the heart.

2\. Slow the breathing down - breathe in and out equally, 4-5 seconds each.

3\. Be in bed by 10:30 pm - to catch the circadian rhythm.

4\. Pulse rate - if it's high, then you're missing potassium or you're eating too much sugar.

5\. Rid body stress - use Dr. Berg's massage tool.
