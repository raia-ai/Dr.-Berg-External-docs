# Does TUDCA contain peanuts or nuts?

TUDCA contains only TUDCA, magnesium stearate, and a vegetable capsule. None of the ingredients are sourced from tree nuts or peanuts, and none are added to the formula. However, as with any supplement, itâ€™s essential to consider potential exposure during manufacturing. Our products are made in a GMP-certified facility that follows strict quality control procedures, including thorough cleaning, sanitation, and allergen management protocols, to minimize the risk of cross-contamination. While cross-contact with allergens like tree nuts or peanuts is unlikely, individuals with severe allergies should consult their healthcare provider before use.
