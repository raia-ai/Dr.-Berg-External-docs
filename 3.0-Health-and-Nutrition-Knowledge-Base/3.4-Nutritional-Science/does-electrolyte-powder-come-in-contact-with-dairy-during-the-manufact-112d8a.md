# Does Electrolyte Powder come in contact with dairy during the manufacturing process?

While our Electrolyte Powder isn't directly exposed to dairy, other animal-derived supplements are made in the same facility. However, we follow strict GMP-certified cleaning processes between production runs, including thorough sanitization and residue testing.
