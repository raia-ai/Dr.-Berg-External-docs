# Can the consumption of yeast contribute to the development of yeast infections or candida infections in individuals?

The answer is no. There are good forms of yeast and bad forms of yeast. To destroy the bad yeast, you need to consume more good yeast. Kefir is the best source of yeast for helping with yeast infections. You can find kefir the health foods store. Make sure you get organic, whole-milk kefir without added flavors.
