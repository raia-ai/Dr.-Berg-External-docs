# What is the transdermal magnesium?

**Many people take transdermal magnesium oil for:**

- Joint pain relief

- Muscle pain

- Leg cramps 

- Fibromyalgia

While transdermal magnesium is good for people who overtrain when working out, if these issues are ongoing, it would be beneficial to consider a deeper cause.

Fibromyalgia is almost always connected to the gallbladder. 

The purpose of magnesium is to provide a mineral for over 400 enzymes that generate ATP, repair DNA and RNA, promote muscle relaxation and nerve conductivity, and help with the production of muscle protein.

You also need magnesium to make vitamin D work. Vitamin D is one of the main anti-inflammatory vitamins.
