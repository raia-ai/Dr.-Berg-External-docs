# Does Glyphosate interfere with the absorption of copper?

Many crops are treated with the herbicide glyphosate, especially "Roundup Ready" types like soy and corn. Glyphosate gets into the soil and food. One effect of glyphosate is that it can bind to and block minerals, particularly copper, making it harder for plants (and potentially people) to get enough of it.
