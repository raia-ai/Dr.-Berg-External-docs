# Can IU (International Units) be converted to mcg?

Yes. However, there is no universal IU-to-mcg conversion because IU measures biological activity or potency while mcg measures weight. However, conversion rates have been established for specific substances. For vitamin D3, the established conversion is:

• 1 IU of vitamin D3 = 0.025 mcg

• 1000 IU of vitamin D3 = 25 mcg

More information on the established conversion rate for vitamin D3 can be found in the FDA's "Converting Units of Measure for Folate, Niacin, and Vitamins A, D, and E on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels: Guidance for Industry" - [**https://www.fda.gov/media/129863/download**](https://www.fda.gov/media/129863/download)
