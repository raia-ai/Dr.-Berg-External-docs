# What is the best diet for Familial Hypercholesterolemia?

With this condition, a person has 50 percent of the LDL receptors than usual, which means they have a higher risk of a buildup of LDL. The top signs of familial hypercholesterolemia are fat deposits on the Achilles tendons, wrists, or eyelids and a condition called arcus senilis, which is whitening around the iris.

**Key points from an important study:**

• The current dietary guidelines for the management of coronary heart disease in familial hypercholesterolemia are based on outdated and unsupported information.

• There’s no evidence to support the recommendations of consuming a low saturated fat diet or low cholesterol diet, which are given to individuals with a genetic cholesterol problem.

• A low-carb diet was found to significantly improve cardiovascular disease biomarkers.

• There is sufficient rationale for conducting clinical trials to assess the effects of a low-carb diet on familial hypercholesterolemia individuals with insulin resistance.

It may be good to question if lowering the cholesterol and saturated fats in your diet is the best strategy to focus on. But talk to your doctor before making any changes to your diet or medications. In my opinion, people with high cholesterol should focus more on lowering their carbs rather than saturated fat or cholesterol.
