# What are the key nutrients and herbs for intermittent fasting?

The longer the fast you undertake, the more important your nutrient intake is. If you already have a nutrient deficiency, a long fast can aggravate it, causing symptoms like dizziness, feeling faint or tired, rashes, muscle cramps, palpitations, or chills.

Taking nutrients or herbs goes against the true definition of fasting, which is drinking only water, eating nothing, and not taking any nutrients or herbs. But, there are not enough calories involved in taking nutrients or herbs to effect the benefits of fasting. Some key nutrients for fasting include B vitamins, trace minerals, vitamins D and C, and electrolytes. Green tea, garlic, wheatgrass juice powder , and turmeric are all good herbs to consume on a fast.
