# What advice do you have for someone with chronic pancreatitis?

I would take TUDCA because it could be related to the little bile duct that's backing up and it's putting pressure onto the pancreatic duct that's causing some inflammation. TUDCA has some great benefits for pancreatitis but of course in this situation I'd always like to go right for the diet.
