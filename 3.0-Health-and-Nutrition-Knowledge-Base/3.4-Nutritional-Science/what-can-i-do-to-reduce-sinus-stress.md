# What can I do to reduce sinus stress?

Sinus congestion from infections or allergies can disrupt daily life. Here are tips to relieve it quickly:

1\. Acupressure:

\- Locate the second vertebra (C2) just below the skull.

\- Press on C2 using your thumb and middle finger while pressing the forehead with the other hand. Hold for two minutes to ease breathing.

2\. Balance pH levels by drinking an acidic mix. Drink a mix of 1 tsp apple cider vinegar and 1 tsp lemon juice in water to reduce alkalinity.

3\. Consume vitamin A-rich foods like carrots and kale to help reduce inflammation. A daily kale shake can help with breathing and reduce sleep apnea symptoms. These steps can help clear sinus congestion and improve respiratory health.
