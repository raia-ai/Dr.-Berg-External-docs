# What are the most important benefits of apigenin?

There is a powerful phytonutrient called apigenin, which comes from cruciferous vegetables, celery, parsley, certain teas and even wheatgrass juice. Apigenin is a flavonoid that is very common and widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Flavonoids are a class of naturally occurring phytochemicals that are found in plant tissues.
