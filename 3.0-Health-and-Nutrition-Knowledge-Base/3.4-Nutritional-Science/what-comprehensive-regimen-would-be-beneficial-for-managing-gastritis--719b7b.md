# What comprehensive regimen would be beneficial for managing gastritis and acid reflux symptoms effectively?

You may find that you can tolerate cabbage-based foods, such as cabbage juice, steamed cabbage, and possibly sauerkraut or coleslaw. Cabbage contains nutrients beneficial for gastritis and ulcers, which could support your healing process.

I recommend starting zinc carnosine immediately, as it can aid in healing. Additionally, considering a carnivore diet—potentially combined with cabbage—may help improve gut health.

It's also worth exploring the possibility of H. pylori involvement, which can affect stomach acidity. Healing your stomach and microbiome should be the priority, so a good probiotic is advisable. Once your gut is healed, you can focus on acidifying it, but that should not be your first step at this stage.
