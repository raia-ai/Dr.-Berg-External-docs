# What are the main causes of gastritis, and how do these factors contribute to inflammation of the stomach lining?

Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach.

Typically, if someone has acidity, acid reflux, or heartburn, either betaine hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar might help. But these are not recommended if you have gastritis. With gastritis there is inflammation in the stomach, so if you add more acid you could make it worse.

An easy way to tell if you may have gastritis is to take apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride and see if you feel worse. If you get worse, you may either have gastritis or an ulcer. If you feel better, it may have been a lack of acid causing the problem in the first place.

**Potential causes of gastritis:**

- Alcohol

- Aspirin

- NSAIDS

- H. pylori

- Cortisol

- Bile
