Our bodies have the ability to get rid of a lot of these poisons if we don’t consume too many.  However, some people have a problem with their detoxification genes. This means that they have a lessened ability to get rid of these poisons.  The best thing to do is to try to avoid these chemicals and consume foods that support the detoxification process, like cruciferous vegetables.
