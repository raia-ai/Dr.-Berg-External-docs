# What are the various causes of infertility?

Inability to get pregnant can be rooted in nutritional deficiencies. If you consume enough of certain nutrients in your diet (not from synthetic sources) you can greatly increase your chances of getting pregnant.

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiencies**

There are certain nutrients that are needed for the female body to be able to get pregnant. Being deficient in those or consuming them from synthetic supplements can be a great barrier to your fertility.

Fat-soluble vitamins, specifically vitamins A, D and E, are very important for being able to get pregnant. These are the vitamins that can go through the fat layer of the cell and can go right into the DNA to start improving your health.

Trace minerals are the minerals that are needed in your body in very small amounts. Specifically, zinc and iodine can cause infertility if you are deficient in them.

If you are deficient in some of these nutrients, it can cause being infertile.
