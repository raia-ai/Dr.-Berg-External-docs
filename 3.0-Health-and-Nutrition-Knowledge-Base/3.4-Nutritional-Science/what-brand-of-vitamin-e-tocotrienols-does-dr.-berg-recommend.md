# What brand of Vitamin E Tocotrienols does Dr. berg recommend?

When considering Vitamin E supplementation, it's important to understand the different forms and their unique benefits. 

**Understanding Tocopherols vs. Tocotrienols** 

Most people get sufficient **tocopherols** (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) through their diet, so supplementing with this form of Vitamin E isn't usually necessary. However, **tocotrienols** (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) are much harder to obtain from food sources and often where supplementation can be most beneficial. 

A key difference lies in their antioxidant power: tocotrienols are significantly more potent at neutralizing free radicalsâ€”up to 50 times faster than tocopherols. Vitamin E, as a whole, is a powerful lipid antioxidant, crucial for protecting the **cell membranes** throughout your body. Without adequate Vitamin E, these membranes can suffer various types of damage. Think of tocotrienols as incredibly fast-spinning antioxidants, efficiently cleaning up and neutralizing free radical damage. 

**Potential Benefits of Tocotrienols** 

The benefits associated with Vitamin E, particularly the tocotrienol forms, are extensive: 

- **Antioxidant Power:** They are highly effective at combating oxidative stress. 

- **Anti-Cancer Properties:** Research suggests potential anti-cancer effects. 

- **Cardioprotective:** They may help protect heart health. 

- **Liver-Protective:** Tocotrienols can support liver function. 

- **Cell Membrane Support:** They play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of cell membranes in your skin, brain, nervous system, and arteries. 

**Natural Sources of Tocotrienols** 

While harder to get, some dietary sources include: 

- Rice (though not typically consumed on a keto diet) 

- Palm oil 

- Annatto (considered one of the best and most potent sources) 

**Buying Vitamin E Tocotrienols** 

If you decide to supplement with Vitamin E, here's what to look for: 

- **Focus on Tocotrienols:** Since tocopherols are generally abundant in diet, prioritize supplements that feature **tocotrienols**. 

- **Source Matters:** Look for tocotrienol supplements derived from **annatto**. Annatto is often favored because it primarily contains delta- and gamma-tocotrienols, which are considered particularly beneficial and potent. Other sources like palm or rice can also be good. 

- **Check the Label for Specific Tocotrienols:** Ensure the product specifies which tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) and tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) are included. Ideally, you want a product rich in the **gamma and delta tocotrienol** forms. 

- **"Full Spectrum" or "Mixed Tocotrienols":** Some products are labeled as "full spectrum" or "mixed tocotrienols," meaning they contain all four tocotrienol isomers. This can be beneficial for comprehensive support. 

- **Avoid Isolated Alpha-Tocopherol:** Be cautious of supplements that primarily contain high doses of isolated alpha-tocopherol, as this can sometimes interfere with the absorption and benefits of other Vitamin E forms, including tocotrienols. 

- **Quality and Purity:** As with any supplement, choose reputable brands that provide **third-party testing** for purity and potency. Look for certifications like GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice). 

- **No Fillers:** Check the "Other Ingredients" list to ensure there are no unnecessary fillers, artificial colors, or preservatives. 

While it can be beneficial to get the whole Vitamin E complex in supplement form (both tocopherols and tocotrienols), a common strategy is to ensure adequate tocopherol intake through diet and then specifically supplement with tocotrienols, ideally from a source like annatto.
