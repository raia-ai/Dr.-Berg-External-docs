# Do I eat less or more calories on intermittent fasting?

**If someone is struggling to lose weight, they typically reduce the calories and end up finding that it will not work.**

Lowering the calories does eventually lower your metabolism. Yet, if you compare spreading your calories out with three meals with two snacks on a 1500 calories per day diet with an increase in calories (2000) for a given day - but ONLY consume two meals per day, you will lose more weight.

**The reason for this is twofold:**

1\. Every time you eat, you stimulate insulin. And insulin is the hormone that blocks fat burning and weight loss.

2\. In the presence of only a tiny excess of insulin above normal will nullify and block fat burning.
