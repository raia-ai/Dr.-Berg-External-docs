# Who’s at risk for magnesium deficiency?

Individuals who consume a diet high in processed foods are more likely to develop magnesium deficiency compared to those who regularly consume whole foods such as seeds, nuts, and green leafy vegetables. 

In addition, people who consume alcohol and those with gastrointestinal conditions such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often don’t absorb adequate amounts of magnesium and are at increased risk of deficiency.
