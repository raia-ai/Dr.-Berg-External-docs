# What brand of black seed oil does Dr. Berg recommend?

**Black Seed Oil: A Timeless Remedy with Modern Benefits** 

While we don't have a specific brand recommendation for **Black Seed Oil** (also known as cumin oil), this ancient remedy, though not the best-tasting, offers a remarkable array of health benefits backed by extensive research. There are over 600 peer-reviewed studies on black seed oil, and it was even discovered in King Tut's tomb, highlighting its long-standing recognition. 

Black seed oil is a rich source of **trace minerals, B vitamins, and healthy fatty acids**. It's renowned for its powerful **antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties**. 

It's particularly effective for **pain and inflammation**, and can be used both **topically and orally**. 

Beyond these broad benefits, black seed oil is incredibly valuable if you're dealing with **insulin-related issues**, whether you're prediabetic or diabetic. It works by supporting the **beta cells** responsible for insulin production. It's also beneficial for **digestion, indigestion, and ulcers**. 

The recommended usage for black seed oil is **1 to 3 teaspoons daily**. It's best to start with **half a teaspoon** and gradually increase your intake to assess tolerance. For enhanced benefits, especially for pain and inflammation, you can **mix it with DMSO in a 1:1 ratio**, as DMSO can significantly aid its absorption when used topically.  

**Best Practices for Buying Black Seed Oil:** 

When purchasing black seed oil, focusing on quality is key to maximizing its potential benefits. Here's what to look for: 

1. **"Cold-Pressed" and "Unrefined":** This is crucial. Cold-pressing ensures that the oil's delicate compounds, including its volatile oils and fatty acids, are preserved and not damaged by heat. Unrefined means it hasn't been chemically processed. 

2. **100% Pure Black Seed Oil (Nigella Sativa):** Ensure the product contains only pure black seed oil without any fillers, additives, or other oils. The botanical name is *Nigella Sativa*. 

3. **Packaging: Dark Glass Bottle:** Black seed oil is sensitive to light and heat, which can degrade its beneficial compounds. Always choose oil packaged in a **dark glass bottle** (amber or cobalt blue) to protect it from UV light. Avoid clear plastic bottles. 

4. **Thymoquinone Content:** Thymoquinone (TQ) is the primary active compound in black seed oil, responsible for many of its therapeutic effects. Some high-quality brands will list the percentage or amount of TQ. Aim for at least 1-2% TQ, with higher percentages indicating more potency. 

5. **Organic Certification:** An organic certification ensures that the seeds were grown without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. 

6. **Third-Party Testing:** Reputable companies often provide third-party lab testing results to confirm purity, potency, and absence of contaminants (like heavy metals or solvents). Check their website for this information. 

By following these recommendations, you can choose a high-quality black seed oil to incorporate into your wellness routine.
