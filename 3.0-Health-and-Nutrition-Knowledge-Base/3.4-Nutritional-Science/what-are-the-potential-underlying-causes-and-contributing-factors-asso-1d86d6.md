# What are the potential underlying causes and contributing factors associated with the development of endometriosis?

**Endometriosis** is a condition whereby the body is making extra tissue that grows outside the uterus - including the Fallopian tubes and ovaries. Estrogen dominance is the deeper cause of this.

Estrogen is anabolic (which means it makes things grow). Symptoms include painful periods, low back pain, and infertility.

**WHAT TO DO:**

1\. Eat organic as much as possible

2\. Eat cruciferous vegetables

3\. Increase iodine, which helps regular estrogen, in the form of sea kelp.
