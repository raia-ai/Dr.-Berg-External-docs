# What are the best drinks to manage diabetes?

Blood sugar often decreases at night, increasing cortisol, which increases blood sugar levels. Poor sleep can also cause blood sugar issues, and frequent urination at night can contribute to this problem. Here are 7 nighttime drinks to help stabilize blood sugar levels throughout the night. Try these drinks to support healthy blood sugar levels and improve sleep.

1\. Apple cider vinegar with cinnamon Add one to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with a pinch of cinnamon to a glass of water for the perfect blood sugar-balancing drink.

2\. Chamomile tea Chamomile tea lowers cortisol and stabilizes blood sugar by directly supporting the cells in the pancreas.

3\. Golden milk Combine turmeric and ginger with milk to make a delicious blood sugar-balancing latte.

4\. Aloe vera juice Aloe vera is known to help with digestion and ulcers and can be applied topically to wounds, but it also potently affects the cells that make insulin.

5\. Berberine tea This herb is close in effectiveness to Metformin, just without the side effects!

6\. Electrolyte drinks (without sugar) Potassium and magnesium are vital for healthy blood sugar levels. Magnesium can significantly decrease cortisol, while potassium can reduce blood sugar and is essential for glucose storage in the liver and the muscles. Most people are not getting enough potassium!

7\. Salt in water Sodium is an important electrolyte that helps reduce blood sugar and cortisol. Add it to water or your electrolyte drinks to help increase hydration. It also supports the adrenal glands, nerves, and muscles.
