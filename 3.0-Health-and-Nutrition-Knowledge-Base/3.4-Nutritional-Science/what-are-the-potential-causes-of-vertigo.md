# What are the potential causes of vertigo?

One cause is having mucus in your sinuses. Another cause is having calcium deposits in the inner ear.

What is potentially behind these problems?

- Too much calcium – Flunarizine is a drug that acts as a calcium antagonist. This means that it blocks calcium. If your situation gets better on this drug, this is a sign that your vertigo is related to too much calcium.

- Not enough vitamin D – New studies show that low levels of vitamin D may contribute to vertigo. Vitamin D is involved in calcium metabolism and regulation. It is also important for promoting the normal function of the immune system, which can potentially reduce sinus congestion.

- Low vitamin K2 – Vitamin K2 helps remove calcium from the wrong places in your body. It then transports the calcium to the bones.

The best remedies for vertigo are:

- Vitamin D3 (10,000 IU/day)

- Vitamin K2 - MK7 version (100 mcg/day)
