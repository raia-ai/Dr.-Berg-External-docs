# What is the science behind low-carb diets?

Low-carbohydrate diets work by reducing insulin levels and promoting fat-burning for energy production. When carb intake is minimized, blood sugar levels stabilize, and insulin sensitivity improves.

This leads to reduced hunger cravings and increased satiety after meals, which can result in weight loss over time.
