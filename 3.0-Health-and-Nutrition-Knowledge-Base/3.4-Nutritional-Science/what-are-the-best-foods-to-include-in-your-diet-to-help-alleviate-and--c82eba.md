# What are the best foods to include in your diet to help alleviate and prevent dry eyes, and how do these foods contribute to eye health?

The glands that produce tears and the ducts that the tears drain through are controlled by vitamin A. A vitamin A deficiency can cause the inner lining of the ducts and the glands to get thicker and rougher. The production of tears or fluids can also diminish.

**Top symptoms of a vitamin A deficiency:**

1\. Night blindness

2\. Blurred vision

3\. Dry eyes

**Taking a vitamin A supplement may not be the best solution in this situation. Instead, you could try getting the vitamin A you need from food.**
