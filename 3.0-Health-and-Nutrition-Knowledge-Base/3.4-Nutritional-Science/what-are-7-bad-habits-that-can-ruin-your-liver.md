# What are 7 bad habits that can ruin your liver?

**7 Lifestyle Factors That Damage Your Liver (And How to Fix Them)**

1. **Overuse of Over-the-Counter Medications:**

    - Surprisingly, common painkillers like Tylenol can lead to serious liver damage if taken excessively. It's crucial to be aware of the potential risks of all medications, even those available without a prescription. Don't assume they're harmless just because they're easily accessible.

    - Natural remedies like milk thistle and NAC can offer liver support.

2. **Leading a Sedentary Lifestyle:**

    - When you consume more calories than you burn, it stresses your body at the cellular level. Regular exercise not only helps you manage your weight but also boosts your immune system, improves circulation, and reduces stress â€“ all of which benefit your liver. Make physical activity a regular part of your routine.

3. **Poor Dietary Choices:**

    - The combination of seed oils (like vegetable or canola oil) with sugar or starch is a recipe for liver damage. These ingredients are found in most processed foods and contribute to insulin resistance, a major factor in fatty liver disease, obesity, and other health issues.

4. **Prioritizing Convenience Over Nutrition:**

    - Busy schedules often lead to grabbing fast food or unhealthy snacks. These choices typically lack essential nutrients and can harm your liver. Plan your meals ahead of time so you're not tempted to make poor choices on the go.

5. **Chronic Stress:**

    - Stress disrupts sleep, affects blood sugar, and can even weaken your immune system. Vitamin B1, vitamin D, exercise, and spending time in nature can all help manage stress levels.

6. **Excessive Alcohol Consumption:**

    - Alcohol is processed directly by your liver, putting a significant strain on it. Sugary mixed drinks are particularly harmful. Limit your alcohol intake and avoid making it a daily habit.

7. **Nutrient Deficiencies:**

    - Your liver needs specific nutrients to function optimally. Include plenty of cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, kale), garlic, onion, and quality protein sources like grass-fed beef and wild-caught fish in your diet to support liver health.

Remember, your liver plays a vital role in your overall health. Taking steps to protect it can have a major positive impact on your well-being.
