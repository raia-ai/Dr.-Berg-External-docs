The reason for these gradual adjustments is to ensure we continue offering the highest-quality products while managing rising costs in sourcing premium ingredients, manufacturing, and quality testing. We are spreading out the changes to minimize the impact on our customers and to make the transition smoother.

When speaking with customers:

- Emphasize that we are committed to **high-quality ingredients**, **rigorous testing**, and **continuous product improvement**.

- Reassure them that we have **kept increases as minimal as possible** while still maintaining the level of quality they expect from us.

- Remind them that investing in their health with trusted, top-tier supplements remains our top priority.

Please be empathetic if customers express concerns and let them know we truly value their loyalty and support.
