# Dr. Berg's Opinion on the Carnivore Diet

I’m going to share my opinion of the carnivore diet after following it for 2 weeks. Not everyone does well on the same diet, so it’s important to experiment with different diets to find the right one for you.

Many people do very well on the carnivore diet! The carnivore diet can be very helpful for people with gut issues and autoimmune conditions. While on the carnivore diet, I ate beef, pork, eggs, seafood, shellfish, and dairy. I discovered that I had been experiencing bloating due to my nut consumption. I didn’t experience any energy changes because I already have high energy.

For the first few days, I didn’t have any bowel movements. This was probably because my gut microbes needed to adjust.

Some people wonder about vitamin C intake on the carnivore diet. When you go on the carnivore diet, your need for vitamin C decreases.

I do not plan to continue the carnivore diet. I will continue eating the same proteins along with salads made from high-quality ingredients. I’ll also consume fermented vegetables like sauerkraut, kimchi, and pickles. I love to add extra virgin olive oil, parmigiano reggiano, nutritional yeast, and feta cheese to my salads. The calcium in cheese binds to any oxalates that are in your salad, removing them from the digestive system.

I’ll also add berries to my diet, but I won’t be eating any nuts!
