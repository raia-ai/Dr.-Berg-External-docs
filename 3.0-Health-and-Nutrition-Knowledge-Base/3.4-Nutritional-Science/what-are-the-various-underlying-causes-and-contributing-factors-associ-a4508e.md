# What are the various underlying causes and contributing factors associated with costochondritis?

**Cause #1: Vitamin D deficiency**

Vitamin D is a very important vitamin for your bones and for reducing inflammation across the body. Vitamin D deficiency can definitely cause bone pain and aching as well as costochondritis.

**Cause #2: Digestive problems**

Just behind the rib cage you have your digestive organs. If your gallbladder or liver are inflamed or enlarged, this can create pressure on your ribs resulting in chest pain and costochondritis. In such a case you could also have bloating and indigestion.
