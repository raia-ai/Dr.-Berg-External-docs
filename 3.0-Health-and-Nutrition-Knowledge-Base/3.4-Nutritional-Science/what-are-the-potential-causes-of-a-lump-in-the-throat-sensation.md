# What are the potential causes of a lump-in-the-throat sensation?

You may have a sensation that something is in your throat when there is nothing in there. This means there is something wrong in your inner throat muscles or the valves in it.

**Symptoms:**

- Spasms in the throat

- Can’t breathe

- Sensation of a lump in the throat

**Cause #1: Hypocalcemia (calcium deficiency)**

Calcium is very important in preventing throat spasms as well as general spasms in the body. If you lack calcium, as well as VItamin D and K2 (which support absorption and utilization of free calcium in your body) this can result in throat “lumps.”

**Remedies:**

- Take calcium lactate

- Take calcium orotate

- Avoid calcium carbonate

- Take vitamins D and K2

**Cause #2: Low stomach acidity**

If you have low stomach acidity, this can result in acid reflux, which means the valve that keeps the acid in your stomach isn’t strong enough and the stomach will push the acid to your throat. This can cause throat spasms and the feeling of a lump in your throat. Additionally if your stomach acidity is not enough, you will not be able to absorb the calcium that is in your diet.

**Remedies:**

- Take apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water)

- Take betaine hydrochloride

**Cause #3: Stress**

Stress over a long period of time can result in the depletion of calcium in the body. The nerves in your throat can get irritated as a result. All you need to know is that if your nervous system is worn out due to a lot of stress, it can result in throat spasms and a feeling like there’s a lump in there.

**Remedies:**

- On an immediate basis--try to slow down your breathing

- Take vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

- Get quality sleep (take naps if needed)

- Take long walks outside daily

- Avoid things/people that stress you out

**Other causes:**

- Viral infection

- Vitamin D deficiency

- GERD (apply the remedies from cause #2)

- Problem with a vagus nerve
