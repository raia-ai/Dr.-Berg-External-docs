# What is the best dietary approach for individuals with a genetic marker for breast cancer, and what specific foods can help reduce risk and support overall health?

If you have a genetic marker for breast cancer, consuming cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, sprouts, and cabbage is highly beneficial. These vegetables contain sulforaphane, a potent phytonutrient that inhibits aromatase, an enzyme responsible for converting testosterone into estrogen. This can help reduce estrogen levels and balance stronger estrogens into weaker, more protective ones. Additionally, cruciferous vegetables stimulate genes that detoxify cancer-causing agents. If you find it challenging to consume these vegetables, sprouts offer a concentrated source of the same benefits.
