# What are the possible causes of red spots on the skin?

**There are two primary underlying causes of having red spots on your skin:**

1\. Diet - You need to consume healthy nutrients to get all of your vitamins. It is especially important that you have 7-10 cups of vegetables per day.

2\. Malabsorption - If you can’t absorb your nutrients, you can develop deficiencies even if you consume the right foods. Probiotics and bile salts may help improve digestion and absorption.

**The best sources of vitamin K1 are:**

• Kale

• Spinach

• Collard greens
