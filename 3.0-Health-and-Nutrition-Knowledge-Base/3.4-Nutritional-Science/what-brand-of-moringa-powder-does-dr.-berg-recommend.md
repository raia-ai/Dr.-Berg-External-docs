# What brand of moringa powder does Dr. Berg recommend?

Dr. Berg does not have a brand to recommend; however, these are the best practices to follow when looking for a Morgina product.

1\. Source
  •  Look for organic moringa grown in clean, uncontaminated soil.
  •  The best moringa often comes from India, Sri Lanka, or parts of Africa, where the tree is native and traditionally cultivated. 

2\. Non-GMO and Organic
  •  Choose moringa that is certified organic and clearly labeled non-GMO. This ensures the leaves are free from genetically modified organisms and synthetic chemical residues. 

3\. Color
  •  A vibrant, deep green powder is a sign of freshness and high nutrient retention.
  •  A pale or yellowish-green hue can signal poor drying practices, oxidation, or age. 

4\. Dried at Low Temperatures
  •  Look for shade-dried or low-temperature dried moringa. High-heat processing destroys delicate nutrients like enzymes and antioxidants.
  •  Labels that mention “gently dried” or “raw” typically indicate better nutrient preservation. 

5\. No Fillers or Additives
  •  The ingredients list should say only one thing: “Moringa leaf powder.” No maltodextrin, rice flour, silica, or flow agents. 

6\. Lab-Tested for Contaminants
  •  Choose a brand that uses third-party testing to check for:
  •  Heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic)
  •  Pesticides and herbicides
  •  Microbial contamination (mold, bacteria, pathogens)
  •  Reputable companies will make lab results available or mention them clearly on the label or website. 

7\. GMP-Certified Manufacturing
  •  Look for products made in a GMP-certified facility (Good Manufacturing Practices). This ensures the powder was processed under strict hygiene and quality controls to avoid contamination and preserve potency. 

8\. Freshness
  •  Check for a harvest or packaging date when possible.
  •  Choose small-batch brands with fast turnover. Older moringa loses flavor, color, and effectiveness. 

9\. Packaging
  •  High-quality moringa comes in opaque, airtight containers — like dark glass jars or sealed foil pouches — to protect against light and moisture.
  •  Avoid clear plastic containers or any packaging that lets in light or air. 

10\. Taste and Smell
  •  It should smell fresh, earthy, and slightly bitter, like green tea or spinach. If it smells musty, sour, or bland, it’s likely old or poorly handled. 

11\. Reputation and Reviews
  •  Choose a brand with a strong reputation and transparent sourcing and processing practices.
  •  Look for verified customer reviews, especially those mentioning improvements in energy, inflammation, or digestion.
