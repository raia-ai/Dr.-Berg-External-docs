# Why do we need magnesium?

**These are some of the most commonly known benefits of magnesium:**

Magnesium has a significant effect on the cardiovascular system. However, it’s also important that you consume a healthy diet. Taking magnesium won’t make much of a difference if you’re eating an unhealthy, carb-loaded diet.

The best sources of magnesium are vegetables. The average person only consumes 1.5 cups of vegetables each day—but you need 7 to 10 cups of vegetables daily for optimal health.

**Other sources of magnesium include:** • Grains (avoid!) • Green vegetables • Nuts and seeds • Seafood • Meats • Berries
