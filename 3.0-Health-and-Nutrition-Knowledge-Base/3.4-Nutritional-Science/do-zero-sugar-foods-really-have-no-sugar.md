# Do zero sugar foods really have no sugar?

Despite recent denials by doctors and organizations like the Sugar Association, there is growing evidence that excessive sugar consumption poses serious health risks, particularly for the cardiovascular system. This mirrors the tactics used by tobacco companies in the past to downplay the dangers of cigarettes.

The average person consumes 23 teaspoons of sugar daily, but this number doesn't account for hidden sugars lurking in many processed foods. Even products claiming to be sugar-free often contain starches, which can spike blood sugar even higher than sugar itself.

Highly processed starches like maltodextrin and modified food starch are not the same as natural starches found in potatoes or rice. They can wreak havoc on blood sugar levels and overall health. When these hidden starches are factored in, the average daily sugar consumption skyrockets to 75 teaspoons!

High-sugar diets deplete nutrient stores and cause oxidative damage, leading to chronic conditions like diabetes, Alzheimer's, inflammation, and skin problems. While processed foods are often fortified with synthetic vitamins, they are no substitute for whole, nutrient-dense foods.

Eliminating sugar and starch from your diet can break this cycle of disease, reverse fatty liver, lower blood sugar, and even promote ketosis, a state where your body burns fat for fuel instead of glucose. Ketones are a superior energy source for the heart compared to glucose.
