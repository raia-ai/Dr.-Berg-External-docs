# Why do low blood sugars occur on Keto?

**When I look deeper at this problem there are 3 things I see often:**

1\. Not doing it correctly not enough vegetables, proteins, or even fat.

2\. Not doing it consistently. Instead, they are "sort of" doing it.

3\. They do not do it long enough for it to work. This can create lots of mood issues - irritability and moody. In other words, you have to do it correctly, long enough to fully keto adapt.
