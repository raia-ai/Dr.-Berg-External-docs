# Does the % daily value (DV) for biotin on the Multi Collagen Peptide label represent a maximum or minimum daily intake?

The 200% Daily Value (DV) of biotin on the label means the product provides twice the FDA-recommended daily intake, which is set at 30 micrograms per day for adults. This is not a maximumâ€”it reflects a level considered sufficient to support normal biological functions, such as energy metabolism and the maintenance of healthy skin, hair, and nails.

Importantly, this is not based on an upper limit, and the FDA has not established a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for biotin because it has a strong safety profile, even at doses much higher than what's included in this formula.

The 60 mcg per serving is well within the range of common dietary supplements, many of which contain 1,000 mcg or more, often marketed for cosmetic or metabolic support without safety concerns.

Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin, meaning that excess amounts are naturally excreted through urine, and the risk of overstimulation or adverse effects at this level is extremely low in healthy individuals.

The %DV helps consumers understand how a nutrient contributes to their daily intake and is based on minimum recommended levels for general nutritional adequacy, not therapeutic or toxic thresholds.
