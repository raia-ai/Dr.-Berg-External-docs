# How is Vitamin D3 extracted from lanolin - sheep wool?

The Vitamin D3 in this product is derived from lanolin, which comes from the wool grease of sheep raised in Australia and New Zealand.

Through a multi-step chemical process, the lanolin is converted into purified Vitamin D3 crystals. These crystals are then dissolved in caprylic/capric triglyceride oil and stabilized with d-alpha-tocopherol before being blended onto a microcrystalline cellulose carrier to form a free-flowing powder.
