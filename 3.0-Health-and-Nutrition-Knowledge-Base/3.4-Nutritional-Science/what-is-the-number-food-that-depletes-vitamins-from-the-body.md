# What is the number food that depletes vitamins from the body?

Refined starches include rice flour, tapioca flour, corn flour, modified corn starch, maltodextrin, and modified food starch. Certain nutrients are required to metabolize refined starch and turn it into energy. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) is vital to this process. Refined starches are much higher on the glycemic index (GI) than sugar—this scale tells you how fast a food can raise blood sugar. Sugar is a 74 on the GI, while refined starches like maltodextrin are 180! Vitamin B1 is not stored in the body in large amounts, so consuming refined starches can quickly cause you to become deficient.

**Symptoms of vitamin B1 deficiency include:**

•Fatigue

•GI problems (slow digestion, bloating, constipation, nausea)

•Low stomach acid

•Low bile

•Stress

•Nervous tension

•Insomnia

•Frequent mood swings

•Muscle twitches

•Breathing problems

Much of the refined starch broken down into glucose in the body can not be used as energy, so it’s converted into lactic acid. This decreases oxygen in the body and makes it more acidic, which can cause hyperventilation and restless legs syndrome.
