# Can I eat salmon on keto?

Yes, you can. Wild-caught salmon is one of the best protein/fat sources that you can consume on keto. It has amazing amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, and contains great protein that is easy to digest.

Make sure it is wild-caught (Pacific) and not farm-raised (Atlantic), because the chronic consumption of farm-raised salmon has been proven to dramatically increase visceral fat, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. It has been detected that pesticides, dioxins, and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls, which are highly toxic industrial compounds) in farm-raised salmon were the cause.

Also, an important point is that salmon has a good amount of selenium, a trace mineral involved in the key enzymes that detoxify heavy metals â€“ including mercury. Selenium-based enzymes protect the brain and nervous system.
