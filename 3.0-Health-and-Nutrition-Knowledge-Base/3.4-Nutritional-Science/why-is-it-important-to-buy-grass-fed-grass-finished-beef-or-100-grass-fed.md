# Why is it important to buy grass-fed grass-finished beef or 100% grass-fed?

Many people envision cattle grazing in fields when they think of beef, and the term "grass-fed" on packaging reinforces this image. However, the reality of beef production in the country is often quite different. True grass-finished beef constitutes less than 1% of the total market.

Standard practice involves raising cattle on grass for about the first six months. They are then transferred to feedlots for several months (typically 4-6). Here, their diet is primarily grain, including waste products from ethanol production, combined with antibiotics and growth-promoting medications. This allows for an unnatural rate of weight gain, up to 3.5 pounds daily, focused solely on rapid fattening. The conditions in feedlots are highly restrictive; animals are kept in very tight quarters, equivalent to six cows occupying just one parking space for months on end.

This system culminates in the cattle being fattened and sent to slaughter. The challenge for consumers is that beef finished on grain is often marketed as "grass-fed." This can be misleading, leading consumers to pay considerably more (e.g., a 70% premium) for beef that did not complete its life cycle on grass, effectively paying a higher price for a grain-finished product. To ensure you are getting beef from animals raised exclusively on grass, labels specifying "grass-fed, grass-finished" or "100% grass-fed" are necessary.
