# Which foods should I prioritize to support and enhance liver detoxification?

**Cruciferous Vegetables**

Kale, broccoli, and cabbage enhance liver detoxification by stimulating enzyme production and reducing inflammation through their sulfur compounds.

**Blueberries**

Blueberries aid in reducing liver fibrosis and inflammation. Their low sugar content enhances their effectiveness in liver health.

**Choline-Rich Foods**

Eggs and fatty fish, rich in choline, help eliminate fat from the liver, supporting its detoxification processes.

**Probiotic Foods**

Sauerkraut and kefir improve detoxification and reduce inflammation by promoting gut health and bolstering liver function.
