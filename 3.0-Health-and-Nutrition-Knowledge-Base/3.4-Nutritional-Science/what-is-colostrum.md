# What is colostrum?

Colostrum is the first milk that a mother gives an infant when theyâ€™re breastfed. Certain studies have shown a dramatic difference in long-term health between infants given breast milk and those given infant formula.

Colostrum contains many different beneficial nutrients and provides the only natural source of two things:

1\. Transforming growth factor alpha-beta This can greatly help regulate the immune system and support tissue repair.

2\. Insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 This has been found to reverse age-related atrophy of the thymus gland.
