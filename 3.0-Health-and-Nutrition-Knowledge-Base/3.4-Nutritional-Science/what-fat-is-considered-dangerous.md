# What fat is considered dangerous?

Fat storage is a survival mechanism, but there is a limitation to how much fuel can be stored. Once your body is out of storage, fat is placed around the organs. This type of fat is called visceral fat. If visceral fat is stored for too long, it spills into your organs. This is called ectopic fat. The good news is that when you burn fat, this is the first to go.

It’s not the number of calories that causes this excess fat storage; it’s the type of calories. Alcohol and ultra-processed foods like high fructose corn syrup cause visceral fat and liver fat. Chronic stress can even cause your body to turn things into sugar. Poor sleep can increase cortisol and visceral fat. Certain medications, such as steroids, antibiotics, antidepressants, and anti-anxiety drugs, can also increase visceral fat.

Seed oils, refined sugars, and starches in the diet directly contribute to mitochondrial damage and visceral fat. To lose visceral fat, you need to eliminate ultra-processed calories. Instead, consume nutrient-dense foods like red meat, eggs, and fish.

HIIT exercise is the best exercise for burning fat. HIIT involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise with rest. Weight training can help reduce belly fat by increasing muscle mass. Long walks can help reduce belly fat by burning fat and reducing stress.

Vitamin B1 helps reduce stress and improve sleep.

Nutritional yeast is one of the best sources of B1.

Vitamin D can also help you lose weight. If you can’t go out in the sun, take at least 10,000 IU of vitamin D3. Make sure to take magnesium with vitamin D3 because it allows for vitamin D's proper function and helps improve sleep. Fasting also helps to burn fat fast by reducing insulin spikes.
