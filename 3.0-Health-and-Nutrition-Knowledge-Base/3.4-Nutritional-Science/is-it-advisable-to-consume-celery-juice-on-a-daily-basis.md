# Is it advisable to consume celery juice on a daily basis?

**Celery Juice: More Than Just Water**

While celery is mostly water, it packs a punch with potent phytonutrients. Here's the breakdown:

- **Beyond Vitamins:** Yes, celery juice has folate and sodium. But the real stars are:

1. **3-n-butylphthalide (3nB):** This powerhouse helps repair stroke damage, promotes healthy blood flow, and may even regenerate brain cells. Plus, it's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and more!

2. **Apigenin:** This well-researched compound, also found in herbs and citrus, relaxes muscles, lowers blood pressure, aids sleep, fights diabetes, AND might help with memory loss.

3. **Coumaric Acid:** Reduces inflammation and ulcers, stabilizes blood sugar, and might ease arthritis pain.

4. **Kaempferol:** A natural defender against viruses, bacteria, and inflammation.

**Best Way to Enjoy:**

- **Morning Boost:** Drink celery juice on an empty stomach for maximum benefits.

- **Go Organic:** Choose organic celery to minimize pesticide exposure.

- **Flavor Kick:** Squeeze in some lemon for a refreshing taste.
