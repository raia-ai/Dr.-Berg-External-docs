# Does drinking alcohol kick you out of Ketosis?

Yes, drinking alcohol can kick you out of ketosis. Your body perceives ethanol as a poison, and your liver prioritizes alcohol detoxification which stops your metabolism from converting fatty acids into ketones. And, whatâ€™s more, alcohol can trigger powerful carb cravings, and you may find it hard to resist enticing carb-rich foods while under the influence.
