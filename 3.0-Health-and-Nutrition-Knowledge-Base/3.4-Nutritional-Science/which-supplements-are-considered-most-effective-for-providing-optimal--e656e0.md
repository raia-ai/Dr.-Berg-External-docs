# Which supplements are considered most effective for providing optimal support for overall health and well-being?

**Boosting Progesterone with Supplements**

Beyond melatonin, **DHEA** and **pregnenolone** can support progesterone levels. DHEA, a key precursor hormone, enhances cognitive function and mood, as shown in a study from *Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology*. Pregnenolone, also a precursor, helps reduce neuroinflammation and support brain health, according to research in the *Journal of Neuroinflammation*.

Combining these with melatonin and healthy habits can effectively support hormone balance and cognitive function.
