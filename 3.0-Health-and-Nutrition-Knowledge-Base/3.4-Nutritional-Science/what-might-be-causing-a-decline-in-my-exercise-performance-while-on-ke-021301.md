# What might be causing a decline in my exercise performance while on keto, and how can I improve it?

Ensure you are getting enough food, but do not eat more than the recommended amount of protein. Do not reduce protein below the recommended amount. Usually adding vitamin B1 (natural and/or nutritional yeast works). We recommend trying our Nutritional Yeast Tablets: [https://shop.drberg.com/nutritional-yeast-regular](https://shop.drberg.com/nutritional-yeast-regular)
