# What signs indicate potassium deficiency I shouldn't ignore?

Here are some signs of potassium deficiency:

•Fatigue

•Muscular issues

•Constipation

•Tremors

•Abnormal heart rhythm

•Mental issues (delirium, hallucinations, psychosis, depression)

•Headaches

•Low back pain

•Dizziness

•Nocturia

•Edema

•Increased pulse rate

•Increased risk of stroke

The most serious symptom of a potassium deficiency is sudden cardiac death. If you have low potassium, your risk for sudden cardiac death increases by 10x.

You could end up with low potassium if you’re not consuming enough potassium-rich foods like leafy greens, squash, nuts, shellfish, bone broth, avocado, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds.
