# What's the best nut for Keto?

Today we’re going to cover the best types of nuts to have on a healthy keto diet. To find out what the best keto nuts are, I took the total carbs and subtracted the fiber to get the net carbs. I also put the fat grams next to the net carbs, because ideally, on the keto diet, you want more fat and low net carbs.

**Best and worst nuts for keto (1 cup):**

• Pecans: Total carbs (14g) - Fiber (10g) = Net carbs (4g) Fat = (71)

• Brazil nuts: Total carbs (16g) - Fiber (10g) = Net carbs (6g) Fat = (88)

• Walnuts: Total carbs (11g) - Fiber (5g) = Net carbs (6g) Fat = (52)

• Macadamia nuts: Total carbs (19g) - Fiber (12g) = Net carbs (7g) Fat = (102)

• Almonds: Total carbs (20g) - Fiber (11g) = Net carbs (9g) Fat = (45)

• Pine nuts: Total carbs (18g) - Fiber (5g) = Net carbs 13g) Fat = (92)

• Almond butter: Total carbs (47g) - Fiber (26g) = Net carbs (21g) Fat = (139)
