# What is adrenal insufficiency?

1. **Definition and Symptoms**:

    - Adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, is characterized by low cortisol levels. Symptoms include fatigue, weakness, weight loss, and low blood pressure.

2. **Causes**:

    - It can be triggered by stress or trauma, which may be physical or mental.

    - Long-term use of corticosteroids like prednisone can also weaken the adrenal glands, contributing to this condition.

3. **Impact on the Body**:

    - Cortisol is crucial for managing stress and has about 200 different functions in the body. It helps in responding to stress and maintaining blood pressure.

    - When cortisol levels are low, it can lead to various health issues, including an impaired immune response.

4. **Treatment and Management**:

    - Dr. Berg emphasizes the importance of B vitamins, particularly B1, to support the body under stress, which is crucial for individuals dealing with adrenal insufficiency.
