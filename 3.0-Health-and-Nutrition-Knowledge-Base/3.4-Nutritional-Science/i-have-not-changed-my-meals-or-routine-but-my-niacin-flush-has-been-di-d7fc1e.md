# I have not changed my meals or routine but my niacin flush has been different every day - why?

Variability in the bodyâ€™s response to niacin is common, and it often has more to do with internal or environmental factors than with the supplement itself.

Even though the meal may have been the same each day, digestion can vary. Things like gut motility, enzyme activity, stomach acid, and even the microbiome can change day to day, which can affect how quickly or strongly niacin is absorbed and processed. Stress, hydration levels, hormone fluctuations, how well someone slept, or what else is happening in the body at the time can impact how niacin affects someone. Niacin sensitivity can build over several days of use, making flushes more or less intense or over time, even if the usage stays the same.

Other factors can also impact niacin response. Taking niacin after a hot shower, during a menstrual cycle shift (if applicable), or on a day when the body is already under some sort of inflammatory load can all amplify its effects.

If the customer feels uneasy about the inconsistent response she is having, reassure her that the manufacturer uses highly controlled processes to ensure each capsule contains the intended amount. If she is still unhappy, we do have the refund policy.
