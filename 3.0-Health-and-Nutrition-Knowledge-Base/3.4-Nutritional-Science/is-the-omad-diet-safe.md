# Is the OMAD diet safe?

Yes, OMAD can be safe when nutrient-dense meals are paired with supplementation.  

However, OMAD is an extreme intermittent fasting method that isn’t suitable for everyone.   

It’s recommended to consult a healthcare professional before starting OMAD to minimize the risk of adverse health effects.
