# Why is selenium an important trace mineral?

Selenium is an essential trace mineral that is often deficient in soil in certain regions, such as the East Coast. This soil deficiency affects animal health, leading to reproductive problems, smaller size, reduced lifespan, and muscle weakness in livestock like sheep, cows, and goats. In humans, selenium is crucial for thyroid function and immune health; deficiency is linked to increased susceptibility to thyroid issues and autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's. While Brazil nuts are a good dietary source, they should be consumed in moderation to avoid selenium toxicity. However, many people do not regularly consume selenium-rich foods, contributing to widespread deficiency. Adequate selenium intake is vital for a healthy immune system.
