# What are some important signs of too high sugar consumption?

Now that we’ve covered the basics of how excess sugar can lurk in our diets, let’s explore the lesser-known consequences. Here are seven surprising signs you might be having a little too much of the sweet stuff.

Recognizing these signs early is crucial to nipping potential health problems in the bud. It can also help you make healthier food choices and decrease your intake of foods with added sugar.

### **1\. Premature Aging and Reduced Collagen**

Think of collagen as your body's natural [anti-aging remedy](https://www.drberg.com/blog/anti-aging) \- it's what keeps our skin firm, elastic, and youthful-looking. However, excess sugar throws a wrench into collagen production through a process called [glycation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-are-advanced-glycation-end-products-ages).

Over time, this leads to wrinkles, sagging skin, and a general aged appearance. So if you're noticing more fine lines and wrinkles than you'd like, that daily sugary soda could be a culprit.

It's like prematurely robbing your skin of its youthful glow. Limiting added sugar in your diet can have a positive impact on your skin.

### **2\. Persistent White Tongue**

A persistently white tongue is not just aesthetically unappealing but can also be a symptom of candida overgrowth. [Candida](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-powerful-candida-and-yeast-killer) is a naturally occurring yeast in the body.

However, too much sugar disrupts the delicate balance, allowing Candida to flourish on the surface of your tongue. This leads to the stubborn white coating often associated with this imbalance.

It's not enough to brush it away. To address the root of the issue, you often need to cut back on sugar and starve those yeast overgrowths. High-sugar diets create an ideal environment for Candida to thrive, leading to this uncomfortable condition.

### **3\. Chronic Sinus Problems**

We often associate sinus problems with allergies or colds, but did you know they can also be linked to sugar? This one might come as a surprise.

As with the white tongue, an overgrowth of certain fungi can contribute to those stuffy noses and sinus headaches we often experience. And guess what those fungi thrive on? You got it—sugar.

A common culprit in [chronic sinus problems](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-food-for-chronic-sinus-issue) is the fungus Aspergillus, which just loves to feast on sugar. Addressing a chronic sinus infection could involve cutting back on those sugary treats as part of a holistic plan.

Reducing sugar intake starves these fungi and may help in managing chronic sinus issues.

### **4\. Red or Pink Gums**

Next time you brush your teeth, pay attention to what you see on the bristles. A bit of pink, especially if it's more than usual, might indicate a very, very mild version of scurvy—yes, scurvy.

This [vitamin C deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/an-interesting-cause-of-a-vitamin-c-deficiency) often appears as gum problems and is linked to excess sugar consumption. Why? Because sugar can interfere with your body's absorption and utilization of vitamin C.

### **5\. Low Testosterone**

Men, listen up. Did you know there is a surprising connection between sugar and testosterone? While the complexities of hormones and diet go beyond simple cause and effect, a diet high in sugar has been linked to dips in testosterone levels.

These imbalances often manifest as decreased libido, trouble building muscle (which we usually attribute solely to exercise and protein), and even low energy levels.

It's always essential to work with a healthcare provider to diagnose the root cause of any hormonal changes you're experiencing.

If you suspect your diet is impacting your hormone levels, consider consulting a registered dietitian or a certified nutritionist for personalized guidance.

### **6\. Susceptibility to Infections**

A robust immune system is our best defense against infections. However, excessive sugar can suppress the immune response, leaving you more vulnerable to various pathogens.

It's as if those extra sugary treats disarm your immune system, making it less effective at fighting off unwanted invaders. So if you’re finding yourself getting sick often, it might be worthwhile to examine your sugar intake as part of a bigger picture.

Eating too much sugar can weaken the body's natural defenses. By reducing your sugar intake, you can support your immune system's ability to fight off infections and stay healthy.

### **7\. High Adrenaline Levels**

When we think of high adrenaline, we often think of stress, right? But it turns out excess sugar consumption can be a hidden stressor for our bodies. Here's how: High sugar intake disrupts your cells' ability to create energy efficiently.

To compensate, your body churns out adrenaline—not necessarily due to mental stress, but because of this cellular energy chaos.

This explains why fatigue can sometimes be accompanied by nervous, jittery energy, often accompanied by restlessness. And it doesn't stop there—chronic adrenaline surges disrupt sleep, potentially leading to conditions like restless leg syndrome.

The effects extend to digestion (think sugar-induced heartburn.) and may even contribute to clotting risks in certain individuals.
