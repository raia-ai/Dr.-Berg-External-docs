# How to smoothly transition to fasting?

Transitioning to intermittent fasting can present challenges, but proper preparation can help ease the process and optimize results.

**Managing Transitional Symptoms**

Common symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, nausea, or dizziness, often referred to as "keto flu," may occur as your body shifts from glucose to ketones for energy. Staying hydrated, getting sufficient sleep, and paying attention to your body's signals are essential for managing these symptoms. If needed, shorten your fasting window or break your fast early to aid adaptation.

**Nutrient Optimization**

Ensuring adequate nutrient intake during eating windows is crucial for overall health. Focus on consuming magnesium, potassium, and B vitamins to support bodily functions. Incorporate nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and whole grains to prevent deficiencies. Consider supplements such as magnesium before bed for restful sleep and citrate-rich foods like lemon juice to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance.
