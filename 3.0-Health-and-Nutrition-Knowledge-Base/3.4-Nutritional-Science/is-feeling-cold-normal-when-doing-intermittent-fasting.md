# Is feeling cold normal when doing intermittent fasting?

Feeling cold is a normal sensation that occurs when you do not eat for stretches of time. The body's core temperature will decrease due to lower calorie intake and lower levels of blood sugar. As you continue fasting, your body will adapt and the cold feelings will lessen, but you can take vitamin B1 to ease this transition.
