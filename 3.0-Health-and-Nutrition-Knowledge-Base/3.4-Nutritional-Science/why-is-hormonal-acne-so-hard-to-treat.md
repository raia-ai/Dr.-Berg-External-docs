# Why is hormonal acne so hard to treat?

Hormonal acne is challenging to treat because it stems from hormone fluctuations during menstruation or conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

These underlying causes make traditional topical treatments less effective on their own; therefore, addressing external symptoms and internal imbalances through dietary and lifestyle changes is crucial in effectively treating this type of acne.
