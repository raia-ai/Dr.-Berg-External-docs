# What is the difference between Potassium Chloride and Potassium Citrate?

**Elemental Potassium Content:** Potassium chloride generally provides a higher percentage of elemental potassium by weight compared to potassium citrate. This means that for a given weight of the supplement, you get more actual potassium from potassium chloride.

Imagine two glasses of orange juice. One is a small glass of concentrated orange juice, and the other is a large glass of diluted orange juice. While the concentrated juice has more orange flavor per sip, the larger glass might contain the same total amount of orange juice overall.

Similarly, a potassium chloride capsule might have a higher concentration of potassium per pill, but a potassium citrate powder mixed into a larger volume of liquid could provide the same or even more total potassium depending on the amount of powder used.
