# Do trace minerals deactivate viruses?

Trace minerals, such as selenium, zinc, and copper, are required in small amounts and play various crucial roles in the body, including the formation of proteins and enzymes. For instance, the thyroid needs selenium to convert T4 to T3.

Importantly, trace minerals can inactivate viruses and prevent their reproduction, putting them back into remission. Zinc, in particular, is effective against viruses causing congestion and sore throat, such as rhinoviruses.
