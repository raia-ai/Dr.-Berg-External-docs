# What are the most important benefits of zinc for the kids?

It’s very important that children have enough zinc in their diet and that they don’t consume things that could deplete them of zinc.  Zinc is important for kids mostly because the neurons in the forebrain are dependent on zinc. This is the part of the brain involved in cognitive processes, including thinking, memory, and speech. 

There are two studies that show a link between a zinc deficiency and neuropsychological problems, especially reasoning. 

**A zinc deficiency could potentially:**

• Inhibit a person’s ability to learn 

• Reduce the ability to have attention 

• Cause poor retention of data (poor memory) 

**It’s also important for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers to take zinc.** 

**The number one thing that depletes zinc is phytic acid. Phytic acid is in things like:** 

• Cereal

• Corn 

• Soy 

• Wheat
