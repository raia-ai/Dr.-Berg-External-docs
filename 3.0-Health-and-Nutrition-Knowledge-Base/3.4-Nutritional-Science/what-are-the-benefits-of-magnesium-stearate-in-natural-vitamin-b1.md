**Magnesium Stearate** 

**Magnesium Stearate in Supplements:** 

1. **Flow Agent:** Magnesium stearate prevents ingredients from sticking together and to machinery during the manufacturing process. This ensures consistent distribution of ingredients within each capsule or tablet.    

2. **Lubricant:** It acts as a lubricant, making it easier for capsules and tablets to be produced and ejected from machinery. This helps prevent damage to the supplements and the machinery.    

3. **Safety:** Magnesium stearate is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA when used in the small amounts typically found in supplements.
