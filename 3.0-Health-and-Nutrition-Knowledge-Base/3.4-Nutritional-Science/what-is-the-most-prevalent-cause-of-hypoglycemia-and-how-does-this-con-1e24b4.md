# What is the most prevalent cause of hypoglycemia, and how does this condition typically manifest in individuals?

If you’re diabetic, blood sugar levels below 70mg/dl are considered hypoglycemia. If you’re not a diabetic, blood sugar levels below 50mg/dl are considered hypoglycemia.

**There are many types of hypoglycemia.**

• Idiopathic hypoglycemic: unknown cause

• Idiopathic postprandial hypoglycemic: symptoms of hypoglycemia without low blood sugars

• Adrenal-related hypoglycemia: hypoglycemia due to abnormal adrenal function

• Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia: related to high insulin

Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is the most common form of hypoglycemia.

**However, the most common cause of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is really excessive carbohydrate consumption, which causes inulin resistance.**
