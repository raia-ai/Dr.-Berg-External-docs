# How can I reduce my blood sugar levels on keto?

To improve lower blood sugar on keto, start by reducing your carbohydrate intake and incorporating fasting into your routine. Regular exercise is crucial, and ensure you get adequate sleep while also spending time in the sun to boost your overall well-being. Manage stress effectively, and increase your fiber intake by eating more vegetables. Consider adding apple cider vinegar (ACV) to your diet and ensure youâ€™re getting enough potassium and Vitamin B1 to support your health.
