# Are the B vitamins in the Natural B1+ compatible with MTHFR?

The B vitamins in Natural B1+ should be compatible with the MTHFR gene mutation. The B vitamins in Natural B1+ are from an all-natural vegetable blend of broccoli flower and stem, carrot root, spinach leaf, sunflower seed, and chlorella. The allithiamine is from raw organic garlic. While the natural sources of the B vitamins in our vegetable blend have not been tested to determine their exact form(s), the Natural B1+ product does not contain folic acid or cyanocobalamin, the synthetic forms of vitamin B9 and B12, which are the primary concern for those with the MTHFR polymorphism.

Please consult with the healthcare professional managing your MTHFR before beginning Natural B1+.
