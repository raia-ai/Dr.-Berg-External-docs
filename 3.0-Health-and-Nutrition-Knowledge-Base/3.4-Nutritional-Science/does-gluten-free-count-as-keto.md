# Does gluten-free count as Keto?

I believe gluten is harmful, and a person should try to avoid it. However, just because something is gluten-free, this doesn’t mean it’s not going to raise your insulin.

For example, grains like wheat might be gluten-free, but it’s still going to affect your blood sugars. Gluten-free grains are better, in my opinion, than grains with gluten. But, it’s important to consume a low-carb diet (20-50g of carbs per day). A person could consume gluten-free grains in small amounts as long as they stick to only having 20-50g of carbs per day.
