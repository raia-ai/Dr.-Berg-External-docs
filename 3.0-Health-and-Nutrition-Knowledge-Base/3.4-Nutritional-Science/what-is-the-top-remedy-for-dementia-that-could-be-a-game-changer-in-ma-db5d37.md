**Promising Research: Natural Ways to Potentially Slow Dementia**

New research suggests a surprising connection between hormones and dementia. The drug Lupron, used to suppress certain cancers, has shown potential in reducing dementia symptoms. Here's why:

- **The Hormone Connection:** Lupron works by lowering luteinizing hormone (LH), which naturally increases with age. Alzheimer's patients often have unusually high LH.

- **Progesterone's Power:** High LH can decrease progesterone, a crucial brain-protective hormone. Progesterone minimizes inflammation, supports neurons, and may even lessen brain injury severity.

- **Boosting Progesterone Naturally:** Melatonin, exercise, DHEA, and pregnenolone may help suppress LH, indirectly raising progesterone.

- **More about Melatonin:** To get a therapeutic melatonin dose, you may need a supplement. Natural ways to increase melatonin include low-light evenings, sunlight exposure, or even sitting by a campfire.
