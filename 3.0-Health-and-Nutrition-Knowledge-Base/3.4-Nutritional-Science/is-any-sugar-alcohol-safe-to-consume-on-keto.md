# Is any sugar alcohol safe to consume on Keto?

Some sugar alcohols are keto-friendly. Here is the chart for different sugar alcohols showing their effects on blood sugars.

Xylitol is a favorite for some people on keto because they say it doesnâ€™t have an aftertaste. Xylitol and everything below it is going to be fine while on keto.

- Maltodextrin - 110

- Glucose - 100

- Sucrose - 65

- High-fructose corn syrup - 58

- Honey - 50

- Maltitol - 35

- Xylitol - 12

- Sorbitol - 9

- Mannitol - 2

- Erythritol - 1

- Monk fruit - 0

- Stevia - 0

Although high-fructose corn syrup has a lower glycemic number compared to maltodextrin, it can be even worse because it messes with your liver and causes insulin resistance. Avoid it at all costs!
