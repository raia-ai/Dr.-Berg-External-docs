# What could be the reasons for experiencing darker skin on your joints?

Darkening of the skin on joints can be indicative of blood sugar imbalances or insulin resistance, often associated with diabetes. This condition can lead to darker pigmentation in skin folds and tissues. If the pigmentation is not due to blood sugar issues, using a vitamin C serum may help improve skin appearance by addressing age spots, pigmentation, and sun damage.
