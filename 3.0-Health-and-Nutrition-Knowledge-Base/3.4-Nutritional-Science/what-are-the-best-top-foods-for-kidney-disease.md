# What are the best top foods for kidney disease?

The top causes of kidney problems are diabetes, insulin resistance, and high-sugar, high-carb diets. Consuming a low-carb diet, like the Healthy Keto® diet, and doing intermittent fasting are two of the best things you can do to help prevent kidney disease. But, if you have stage 3A through stage 5 kidney disease, you may want to consider making some adjustments to your keto plan.

If you have a kidney problem, it’s important to work with your doctor to make sure certain nutrients aren’t out of range. These nutrients include potassium, sodium, and phosphorus. Protein levels can also become too high if someone has a kidney problem.

The best diet tips for kidney disease:

• Consume lower amounts of high-quality protein (pasture-raised organic eggs, wild-caught fish, seafood, and grass-fed, grass-finished beef)

• Consume lower amounts of sodium (2,300 mg of sodium per day)

• Avoid processed foods and junk foods

• Avoid high-potassium foods and consume low-potassium foods

• Avoid soda

• Avoid foods high in phosphorus

• Take the natural form of certain vitamins (B vitamins, vitamin C, and vitamin D3)

• Get plenty of omega-3 fatty acids (take cod liver oil)
