# What is ADHD, and how can it be viewed as a nutritional issue rather than solely a mental health condition?

A child with ADHD is described as having trouble getting started on tasks, getting dressed, putting away toys—the child ignores directions or delays in following directions, has a hard time sitting during meals, fidgets or talks when they are expected to be quiet, has trouble stopping one activity to begin another, struggles to slow down enough to do things carefully, needs to be reminded a lot to stop and listen, has a hard time paying attention, grabs things without permission, is unable to wait for directions, takes too much time to complete tasks, has trouble remembering directions, has trouble recalling facts they just learned, and gets very upset or annoyed over minor frustrations.

These are all normal behaviors for a second-grader. And yet, they are labeled as ADHD and put on drugs.

Instead of giving kids prescription drugs for normal behaviors, you should support a child’s healthy behaviors naturally with nutrients.

**These nutrients can help promote calmness and focus:**

• Vitamin B1

• Potassium

• Magnesium

**Avoid:**

• Sugar

• Preservatives
