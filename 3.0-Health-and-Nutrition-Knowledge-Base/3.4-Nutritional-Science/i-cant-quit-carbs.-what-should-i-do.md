# I can’t quit carbs. What should I do?

Carbohydrates are highly addictive. We are conditioned as children to feed a carb addiction – most children consume large amounts of sugar daily. Sugars and refined grains are added to baby food, cereal, candy and virtually all processed foods.

Carbs are so addictive because they trigger two hormones: dopamine and serotonin. These are pleasure and happiness hormones.

Over time, an addiction to carbs becomes stronger and stronger. So what can you do to break a carb addiction? Take a look.

- Stop eating immediately – The first thing you should do is start fasting. This will kick-start ketosis, which is when your body burns fat as fuel instead of glucose (sugar). This will begin to heal your neurotransmitter receptors that are triggering intense carb cravings.

- Exercise – This will further increase your fat-burning and allow you to get rid of any excess glucose in your system.

- Avoid triggers – Get rid of all carbohydrates and sugars in the house, avoid images of food (like commercials or unhealthy recipe books), don’t go to restaurants with unhealthy foods, avoid food smells that cause cravings, etc.

- Take B vitamins – All B vitamins are important for lessening the addiction to carbs– especially vitamin B1. Using nutritional yeast is a great way to get your B vitamins.
