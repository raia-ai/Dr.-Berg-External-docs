# The Keto-Friendly Snack - Olives

The [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-ketogenic-diet-plan-for-beginners) is a high-fat, low-carb eating plan that has gained popularity recently for its potential weight loss and health benefits. Olives fit perfectly into a ketogenic diet, as they are high in healthy fats and low in carbs.

Snacking on olives can help you stay in ketosis, a metabolic state in which your body burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates.

### **Fermentation's Role in Reducing Lectins**

Olives undergo a fermentation process that enhances their flavor and makes them more digestible by reducing harmful compounds called lectins.

Lectins are proteins found in many plant foods that can interfere with nutrient absorption and cause digestive issues in some people.

The fermentation process used to cure olives helps break down lectins, making the olives easier to digest and less likely to cause gastrointestinal discomfort. This is good news for people with sensitive digestive systems or those following lectin-free diets.
