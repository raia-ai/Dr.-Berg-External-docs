# Can I use balsamic dressing for my salad?

Most salad dressings are filled with GMO soy, corn oil, sugar and MSG. Even some of the salad dressings that are advertised as healthy or organic may have some of these things.

You can make balsamic dressing yourself though. This is an incredibly easy recipe, it’s super healthy, and you might really enjoy it.
