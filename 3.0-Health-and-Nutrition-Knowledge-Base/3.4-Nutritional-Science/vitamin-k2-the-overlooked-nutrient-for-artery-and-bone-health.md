# Vitamin K2: The Overlooked Nutrient for Artery and Bone Health

**Vitamin K2: The Overlooked Nutrient for Artery and Bone Health**

It might surprise you to learn that Vitamin K2, found in many foods we've been told to limit, is actually crucial for maintaining healthy arteries and bones. A deficiency in this vital nutrient can contribute to a range of issues, from soft tissue calcification and bone loss to osteoporosis and even cavities.

**Where to Find Vitamin K2**

While our bodies can convert some vitamin K1 from leafy greens into K2, the most abundant sources are:

- **Natto:** This fermented soybean product reigns supreme in vitamin K2 content.

- **Organ Meats:** Eel, goose liver, chicken liver, and beef liver are also excellent sources.

- **Animal Products:** Butter and cheese from grass-fed animals, salami, and pork chops offer moderate amounts.

- **Fermented Foods:** Fermented vegetables like sauerkraut contain small amounts of K2.

**Why You Need Vitamin K2**

Vitamin K2 plays a vital role in directing calcium to where it belongs – in your bones and teeth – and keeping it out of your arteries and soft tissues. This process helps prevent calcium buildup, which can lead to hardened arteries and other health problems.

**Factors Affecting Vitamin K2 Production**

Several factors can hinder your body's ability to produce or utilize vitamin K2:

- **Gut Microbiome Imbalance:** A healthy gut is essential, as the microbe *B. subtilis* is primarily responsible for converting K1 to K2. Unfortunately, this microbe is sensitive to:

    - Antibiotics

    - Steroids

    - PPIs and antacids

    - Glyphosate (found in GMO foods)

    - Alcohol

    - Junk food

    - High-sugar diets

- **Liver Health:** A compromised liver can impair K2 absorption.

- **Low-Fat Diets:** Since K2 is fat-soluble, adequate fat intake is necessary for absorption.

- **Magnesium Deficiency:** Magnesium works synergistically with K2 for optimal calcium regulation.

**Supplementing with Vitamin K2**

If you're concerned about your vitamin K2 levels, consider supplementing with MK7, the natural form of K2. A general guideline is to take 100 mcg of MK7 for every 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 you consume.

**Key Takeaway:** Don't underestimate the importance of vitamin K2 for your overall health. Prioritize a balanced diet with K2-rich foods, support your gut health, and consider supplementation to ensure you're getting enough of this critical nutrient.
