# How do you get rid of acid reflux permanently?

To address acid reflux permanently, consider the following approach:

1\. **Betaine Hydrochloride**: Gradually increase your intake to the point just before experiencing heartburn, then reduce the dose. This helps improve stomach acid levels, which are crucial for digestion.

2\. **B Vitamins**: Essential for hydrochloric acid production, ensuring adequate intake can support stomach acid levels.

3\. **Probiotics**: Supplementing with probiotics can help balance gut flora, reducing pressure on the digestive system and potentially alleviating reflux symptoms.

Addressing these areas may require several months of consistent effort for significant improvement.
