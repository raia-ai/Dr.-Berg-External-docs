# What are the various underlying causes of anemia, including nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, genetic factors, and environmental influences?

1. **Low stomach acid**

Low stomach acid level can cause inability to absorb minerals from food, including iron, therefore causing anemia.

2. **Excessive menstruation**

This means too much estrogen in the body. Regulating estrogen levels (lowering them) can help.

**Cause #5: Vegan diet-related**

Some of the vegan diet foods have certain things like oxalates or phytates that block iron. This makes it difficult to have enough iron intake. Try to avoid eating too many refined grains.
