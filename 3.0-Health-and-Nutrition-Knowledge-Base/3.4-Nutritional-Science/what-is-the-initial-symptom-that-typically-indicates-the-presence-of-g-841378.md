# What is the initial symptom that typically indicates the presence of gallstones?

Gallstones often present without symptoms in 80% of cases, but symptoms can include pain under the right ribcage and rhomboid, nausea, vomiting, and digestive issues like bloating and belching. The formation of gallstones is linked to high cholesterol and insufficient bile production, which is crucial for cholesterol metabolism. Bile sludge, a precursor to stones, can persist even after gallbladder removal, causing similar symptoms.

Natural approaches to manage gallstones include taking purified bile salts and probiotics, consuming salads, using acupressure, and reducing insulin levels through methods like intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet.
