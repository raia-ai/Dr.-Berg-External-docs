# Does the Nutritional Yeast product have any traces of acetaldehyde?

The Nutritional Yeast may contain trace amounts of acetaldehyde, which may be present as a normal byproduct of yeast metabolism. However, these levels are much lower than those found in fermented products like beer or wine and do not pose any health risk.
