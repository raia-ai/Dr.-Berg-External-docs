# Which prebiotics or probiotics are best for relieving antibiotic-induced lactose intolerance and restoring gut health?

To address lactose intolerance caused by antibiotics, consider the following approaches:

1\. **Prebiotics**: Consume a variety of fibers and plant-based foods, such as leafy greens, to support a diverse microbiome. Avoid grains and focus on nutrient-rich plants.

2\. **Probiotics**: Incorporate fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, and kefir to help restore beneficial bacteria that aid in lactose digestion.

3\. **Intermittent Fasting**: Implementing intermittent fasting may enhance microbial diversity and overall gut health.

These strategies can help rebuild gut flora and improve lactose digestion over time.
