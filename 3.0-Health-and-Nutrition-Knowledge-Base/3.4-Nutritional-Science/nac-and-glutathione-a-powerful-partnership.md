# NAC and Glutathione: A Powerful Partnership

NAC's primary mechanism of action is increasing the body's levels of glutathione. Glutathione is a vital antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress and damage caused by free radicals and toxins. When the body is exposed to excessive toxins or experiences high levels of oxidative stress, glutathione can become depleted, leading to cellular damage, particularly in organs like the liver. 

Glutathione helps the body by: 

- Detoxifying xenobiotics (poisons) 

- Combating free radical damage 

- Counteracting the effects of hydrogen peroxide 

- Chelating heavy metals 

- Reducing pathogens 

- Decreasing oxidative stress 

Factors Affecting Glutathione Levels: 

Low glutathione levels can be associated with various conditions, including: 

- Cancer 

- HIV 

- Infections 

- Trauma and burns 

- Chronic diseases and inflammation 

- Overtraining 

- Poisoning 

- Diabetes 

Other Nutrients that Support Glutathione Production: 

Beyond NAC, other nutrients can also help boost glutathione levels, such as: 

- Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) 

- Vitamin D 

- SAMe (S-Adenosylmethionine)
