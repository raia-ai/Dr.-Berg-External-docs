# What are the primary causes of paresthesia?

A paraesthesia is a problem with your nervous system; that is, you have some kind of abnormal nerve sensation coming from your sensory nerves. **If these nerve fibers are damaged, you can experience symptoms including:**

- Numbness

- Tingling Pins and needles

- Cold or burning pain

- Feeling of ants crawling on your skin

- Body parts feel heavy

- Hypersensitivity to pain; or, conversely, low pain sensitivity

By far the most common cause of paraesthesia is a high carbohydrate diet. By this I mean a diet with too much sugar, or refined carbs such as bread, pasta, crackers, and the like. This is because a high carb diet primarily causes a B vitamin deficiency. And this explains why most diabetics, who are told to follow a high carb diet, have issues with peripheral neuropathy, nerve damage, and paraesthesia.
