# What are effective upper back stretches to relieve stiffness?

One of the challenges with having shoulder pain is that it holds a lot of stuck energy, which makes your neck and upper back very tight. A lot of people have these issues, but these upper back stretches may help.

These upper back stretches are not taught in schools. They are stretches Iâ€™ve developed after seeing what has worked for thousands of my patients. It does help to have someone do this technique on you, but you can try to do this yourself.

The upper back stiffness could also be caused by referred pain. For example, right shoulder pain could be caused by the gallbladder. To help improve the gallbladder, you may need to clean up your diet.
