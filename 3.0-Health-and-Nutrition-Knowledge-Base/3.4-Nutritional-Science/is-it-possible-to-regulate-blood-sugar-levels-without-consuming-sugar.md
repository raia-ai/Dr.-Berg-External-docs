But the body can also convert foods into ketones, which serve as an excellent source of energy for both the brain and body. If you want to control your blood sugar levels without eating sugar, try switching to a low-carb diet like Healthy KetoÂ® as this will reduce insulin spikes while also ensuring you have plenty of energy.
