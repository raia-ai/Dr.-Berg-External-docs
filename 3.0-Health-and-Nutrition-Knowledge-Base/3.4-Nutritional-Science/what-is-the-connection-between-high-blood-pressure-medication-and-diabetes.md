# What is the connection between high blood pressure medication and diabetes?

Diuretics are commonly used to treat high blood pressure. But, they come with side effects, including an increased risk of developing diabetes.    On the flip side, ace inhibitors, also used to treat high blood pressure, protect against diabetes and lower the risk of diabetes.  I believe the big difference between these two drugs, when it comes to diabetes risk, is what they do to potassium.

Diuretics deplete potassium, and without enough potassium, insulin can't be released very well. A deficiency of insulin can then lead to diabetes. Ace inhibitors increase potassium by helping to prevent the loss of potassium.  So why do we even need a drugâ€”why aren't we just consuming more potassium? Many people support healthy blood pressure and healthy blood sugar levels by taking potassium.
