# What are some unexpected benefits of iodine?

Iodine is highly antiestrogenic. Estrogen dominance increases the risk of cancer, especially in the breast, ovary, and uterus. Iodine causes cancer cells to self-destruct. Iodine strengthens the thyroid, which improves your overall health. It also strengthens the immune system and reduces inflammation.

Iodine is also vital for a healthy pregnancy. Iodine is considered a halogen, so other halogens like bromide and fluoride compete with iodine in the body. Increasing your iodine intake can help detox these other halogens. Try drinking water with unrefined sea salt for several days, then begin taking Lugol’s iodine solution—a mixture of two different types of iodine. Take this solution for about five days, then take two days off.

Also, consume between 3 and 9 grams of vitamin C, 400 mg of magnesium, 100 mg of selenium, and the complete B-complex to detox these other halogens completely. If you have hyperthyroidism, do not take iodine.

Just because you’re allergic to shellfish does not mean you are allergic to iodine.

Goitrogenic foods like cruciferous vegetables and lima beans block iodine—but if you regularly consume sea kelp, it counters any bad effects. High amounts of iodine can be beneficial for respiratory viruses. Iodine also binds with mercury and aluminum, helping rid the body of toxic metals.
