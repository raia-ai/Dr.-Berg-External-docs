# Importance of Specific Supplements for Autism

### **Importance of Specific Supplements for Autism**

[N-acetylcysteine (NAC)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-does-nac-n-acetylcysteine-work), selenium, cod liver oil, vitamin D3, methylcobalamin (a form of Vitamin B12), and methylfolate are essential to ensure proper brain functioning as they help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation—both being significant contributors to autism.

They aid in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation—two factors heavily implicated in autism.

Methylene blue is another exciting piece of this puzzle—it's been found to help fix mitochondrial dysfunction often seen with autism. [Studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6078194) its potential benefits when used alongside traditional treatments.

Incorporating these supplements into an individual's diet plan can provide much-needed support toward improved well-being.

Coenzyme Q10 has also demonstrated promise, enhancing energy production at a cellular level—an important aspect considering the connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and autism.

## **Amino Acid Abnormalities in Autism**

Abnormal amino acid profiles are common among individuals with autism. This can contribute to their neurological and behavioral symptoms.

### **The Role of Amino Acids in Neurological Function**

Amino acids are essential for our brain's normal functioning, neurotransmitters or precursors. Imbalances may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders like autism.

An exciting example is [glutamate](https://www.drberg.com/blog/msg-vs-glutamate-whats-the-difference), an excitatory neurotransmitter whose excessive levels might cause neuronal damage and inflammation linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

### **Tackling Amino Acid Imbalance**

Correcting these imbalances through diet and supplements could potentially help manage autistic symptoms.

[Studies suggest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23515006) that foods rich in essential amino acids, such as eggs, seafood, shellfish, and organ meats, along with certain supplements, can assist the body in balancing its production of neurotransmitters.
