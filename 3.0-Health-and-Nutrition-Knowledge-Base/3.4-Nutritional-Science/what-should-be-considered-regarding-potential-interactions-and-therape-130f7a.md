# What should be considered regarding potential interactions and therapeutic efficacy when consuming ginger alongside various medications?

Before incorporating ginger, especially in supplement form, speak with your physician, particularly if youâ€™re on medication, have underlying health concerns, or are expecting or nursing.

Since individual responses can vary, your doctor can offer guidance based on your circumstances and medication regimen, helping you mitigate any potential risks or drug interactions.
