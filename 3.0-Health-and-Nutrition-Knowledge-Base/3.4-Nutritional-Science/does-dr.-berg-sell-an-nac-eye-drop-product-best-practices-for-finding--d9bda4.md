# Does Dr. Berg Sell an NAC Eye Drop Product? Best Practices for Finding NAC Eye Drops

Dr. Berg has highlighted the advantages of NAC eye drops in breaking down mucus, decreasing inflammation, enhancing antioxidant defense, stabilizing the tear film, and aiding in issues such as dry eye, corneal damage, and oxidative stress-related eye conditions. However, he does not offer an NAC eye drop product. When looking for such a product, consider these best practices:

• Look for formulations with pharmaceutical-grade NAC, ideally buffered to be pH-appropriate for eye use.

• Check for products labeled as “ophthalmic use” or “eye-friendly pH”, which indicate the drops are designed specifically for the eyes.

• Seek out reputable suppliers with verified customer reviews, a responsive support team, and transparent return policies.

• Consider contacting compounding pharmacies, which may be able to provide NAC eye drops prepared under sterile conditions.

Please avoid using NAC powders or general NAC supplements in or near the eyes, as they are not formulated for ocular use and may cause irritation or harm.
