# What is the most crucial nutrient for prostate health, and how does it contribute to maintaining or improving prostate function?

Zinc is crucial for prostate health, as the prostate contains significantly higher levels of zinc than the blood. Zinc deficiency can lead to prostate enlargement, especially with age. To support prostate health, focus on zinc-rich foods like oysters, shellfish, and high-quality red meat, such as grass-fed beef. Avoid processed meats and refined grains, which can negatively impact health.
