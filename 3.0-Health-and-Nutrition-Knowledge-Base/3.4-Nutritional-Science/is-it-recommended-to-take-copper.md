# Is it recommended to take copper?

Copper is a very important trace mineral (minerals that are needed in small amounts) that has to do with normal functioning of your brain and nervous system. It is also important for other functions and parts of your body.

Copper is good in the right amounts. You donâ€™t want to have too much of it, as it has some toxic effects on you. You should know that when you increase copper, you severely decrease zinc, and you can create an imbalance. Estrogen also would increase copper in the body, and copper itself can stop the liver from removing excess amounts of estrogen.
