# What are the potential causes of white patches on the tongue, and how do factors such as infections, oral conditions, and irritants contribute to this phenomenon?

White tongue can cause cosmetic discomforts. I always suggest handling the problem from the inside out. Cleaning the tongue is only a temporary solution and will not resolve the underlying issues.

**Cause 1: Overgrowth of candida**

Candida normally is a friendly microbe in the body. But this microbe can turn into fungus if you take antibiotics, birth control pills, or if you are on a high-carb diet. The solution is to improve your bacterial balance in the body. It should be noted that if you take probiotics in quantities that are too great, or fermented foods without preparing for them, these can be the cause of microbial imbalance and can result in continuance of the white tongue. Therefore, start gradually.
