# What approaches should be considered for managing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?

First, I want to start off by saying that ADHD is not genetic—there’s no evidence that says it is. In fact, it’s also not a Ritalin deficiency. From my viewpoint, it’s not even a mental disease—it’s purely a nutritional deficiency.

**Symptoms of ADHD include:**

• Inability to focus/pay attention

• Hyperactivity

• Restlessness

• Visual learning problems

• Difficulty reading

• Poor memory

A 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial showed significant improvements in the behavior of children with ADHD when given high doses of EPA and DHA (750mg) daily. If you have ADHD, (EPA and DHA) can help. You especially want to take EPA.

EPA and DHA are omega-3 fatty acids. You have omega-3s, and you have omega-6s. Your body cannot make these—you have to get them from your diet.

The problem is, you need more omega-3s and less omega-6s. Omega-3s are far more important. However, the average person consumes 16x more omega-6s. Omega-3s have antipsychotic properties, improve your cognition, and boost your IQ. They also help with brain development. Omega-3s can improve levels of dopamine and serotonin. They have neuron-protecting powers.

Vitamin B1 can also help your child with restlessness and hyperactivity. Nutritional yeast is a great source of B vitamins. You can try taking 750 mg of omega-3s EPA/DHA, reduce your intake of omega-6s, and increase vitamin B1 for ADHD.
