# What is the ideal zinc-to-copper ratio for optimal health, and how does this balance influence various physiological processes and prevent potential deficiencies or imbalances?

The recommended ratio of zinc to copper is generally 8 to 1. This means that for every 8 milligrams of zinc, you should have 1 milligram of copper. This ratio helps prevent side effects and ensures that both minerals are balanced in the body. Though the 8:1 ratio is ideal, a 4:1 to 12:1 ratio is acceptable and effective.
