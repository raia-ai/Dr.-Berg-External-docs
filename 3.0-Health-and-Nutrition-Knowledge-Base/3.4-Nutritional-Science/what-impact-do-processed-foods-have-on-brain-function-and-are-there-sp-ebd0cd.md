# What impact do processed foods have on brain function, and are there specific types or qualities of processed foods that can be considered acceptable?

Sugar affects the brain’s reward circuitry in just 600 milliseconds—20 times faster than nicotine. Some food companies have allegedly suppressed sugar research and influenced laws to avoid liability for processed food side effects. Processed foods and sugar can exhibit addictive qualities, meeting criteria for substance use disorders:

1\. **Hazardous use**: Potential for harm or overdose.

2\. **Social problems**: Relationship conflicts due to use.

3\. **Neglected responsibilities**: Failures at work, school, or home.

4\. **Withdrawal**: Symptoms upon cessation.

5\. **Tolerance**: Needing more for the same effect.

6\. **Increased use**: Escalating consumption.

7\. **Failed attempts to quit**: Difficulty cutting back.

8\. **Time spent**: Significant dedication to consumption.

9\. **Health issues**: Physical or psychological harm.

10\. **Abandoning activities**: Reduction in once-enjoyed pursuits.

11\. **Cravings**: Strong desires for the substance.
