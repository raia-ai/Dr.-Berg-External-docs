# What are the nutritional benefits of citruses?

Citruses are plants that are native to subtropical and tropical regions of Asia, Island Southeast Asia, Near Oceania, and northeastern Australia.

Oranges and grapefruit contain too much sugar for keto, so weâ€™re going to focus on lemons and limes. Citrus fruits have a lot of phytonutrients (healthy substances found in plants) and vitamins that are good for your body. For example, you get the whole vitamin C complex from a citrus, rather than just the ascorbic acid you would get from a synthetic vitamin C supplement.
