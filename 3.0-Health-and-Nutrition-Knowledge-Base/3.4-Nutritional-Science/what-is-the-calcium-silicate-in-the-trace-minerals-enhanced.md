# What is the calcium silicate in the Trace Minerals Enhanced?

**Calcium Silicate** 

Calcium silicate, when used in supplements, primarily functions as an anticaking agent. 

- **Prevent clumping:** Calcium silicate absorbs moisture, preventing ingredients from sticking together and ensuring the supplement flows freely during manufacturing and packaging. This maintains the quality and consistency of the product.
