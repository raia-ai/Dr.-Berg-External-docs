# What constitutes a mood disorder?

Cholesterol serves as a crucial precursor for hormones like estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol, essential for mood and overall well-being. Low cholesterol levels, often due to low-fat diets or statin drugs, can lead to hormonal imbalances and depression. Adequate cholesterol intake from animal foods, egg yolks, and butter is vital, especially for vegetarians who may struggle to obtain sufficient cholesterol from plant-based sources. Supporting gallbladder health with purified bile salts can aid in cholesterol availability for hormone production.
