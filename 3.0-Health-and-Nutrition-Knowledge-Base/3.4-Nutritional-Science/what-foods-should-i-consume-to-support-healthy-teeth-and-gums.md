# What foods should I consume to support healthy teeth and gums?

Ensuring optimal dental health involves consuming essential vitamins and foods that support teeth and gum health.

Vitamin A helps prevent conditions like gingivitis and periodontitis, while vitamin C supports gum health and prevents issues like loose teeth and bleeding gums.

Vitamin B1 can alleviate nerve pain and toothaches.

Vitamins D, K2, and F work together: D aids in calcium absorption, K2 directs calcium to the teeth, and vitamin F facilitates calcium incorporation into tissues.

Grass-fed butter or ghee and cod liver oil are excellent dietary choices for dental health, providing crucial nutrients like vitamins A, D, and K2.

Fermented vegetables contribute vitamins C and K2 and promote a healthy microbiome that produces B vitamins, complemented by nutritional yeast for additional B vitamin support. These components collectively promote strong teeth and gums while supporting overall oral health.
