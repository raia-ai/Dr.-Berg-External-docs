# What is the distinction between folate and folic acid, particularly in terms of their forms, sources, and how the body absorbs and utilizes each?

**Folate vs. Folic Acid: What's the Difference?**

- **Folic acid:** A synthetic form of vitamin B9 often added to supplements and fortified foods.

- **Folate:** The natural form of vitamin B9 found in whole foods.

**The Problem with Folic Acid**

Many people have a genetic variation that makes it difficult for their bodies to convert folic acid into the usable form of vitamin B9. This can lead to health concerns if too much unconverted folic acid builds up.

**The Solution: Methylfolate**

Methylfolate is a readily usable form of vitamin B9 that bypasses the need for conversion. This makes it a safer and more effective choice, especially for those with genetic variation.

**Key Takeaways**

- **Opt for Methylfolate:** Choose supplements with methylfolate instead of folic acid.

- **Focus on Food:** Get natural folate from leafy greens and other whole foods.
