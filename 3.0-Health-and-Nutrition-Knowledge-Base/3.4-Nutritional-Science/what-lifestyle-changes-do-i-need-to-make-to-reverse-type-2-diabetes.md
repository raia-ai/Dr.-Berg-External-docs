# What lifestyle changes do I need to make to reverse Type 2 Diabetes?

While dietary changes are essential for reversing type 2 diabetes, other lifestyle factors can also have a significant impact on your blood sugar control and overall health. These include regular physical activity, stress management, and medication adjustments.

### **The Importance of Physical Activity**

Exercise is a powerful tool for managing type 2 diabetes. When you engage in physical activity, your muscles use glucose for energy, helping to lower your blood sugar levels.

Regular exercise also improves your insulin sensitivity, making it easier for your cells to respond to insulin signals.

Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming. Resistance training, such as weightlifting or bodyweight exercises, can also be beneficial for building muscle mass and improving insulin sensitivity.

### **Managing Stress for Better Blood Sugar Control**

Chronic stress can have a negative impact on your blood sugar levels and overall health.

When you're stressed, your body releases hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can cause your blood sugar to rise and make it harder for insulin to work effectively.
