# What are the underlying factors that contribute to sleep disturbances in individuals with insomnia?

You need enough melatonin to get to sleep and stay asleep. But, melatonin supplements may not be the best idea because you’re not fixing the root cause of your sleep problem.  Melatonin comes from another hormone called serotonin—90% of the serotonin in your body is made with the help of your friendly bacteria. 

Your friendly bacteria turns tryptophan into serotonin and then converts it to melatonin. But, you also need vitamin B6 to help with these conversions.  If you have trouble sleeping, it’s important to focus on supporting your microbiome. 

**Here are a few fantastic ways to support the microbiome so you can start sleeping better:**

• Take probiotics 

• Take vitamin B6

• Consume kefir 

• Consume fermented foods (sauerkraut or kimchi)

• Consume fiber from vegetables (unless you have a gut problem)
