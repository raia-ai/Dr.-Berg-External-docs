# Can Healthy Keto help with psoriasis?

Yes, the Healthy KetoÂ® diet can help with psoriasis. Here are some key points from Dr. Berg's recommendations:

\- **Anti-Inflammatory Foods**: Incorporating anti-inflammatory foods such as berries, vegetables, fatty fish, and nuts into your diet can help reduce inflammation, which may alleviate symptoms of psoriasis.

\- **Healthy Fats**: Consuming healthy fats like avocados, nuts, and fatty fish provides essential fatty acids for maintaining healthy skin. These fatty acids help moisturize your skin, reduce inflammation, and protect against sun damage.

\- **Vitamin D and Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Supplementing with vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, found in cod liver oil, can help manage psoriasis symptoms. Vitamin D helps regulate T-cells, and omega-3s are potent anti-inflammatories that can reduce dry, scaly, and red skin.

\- **Bile Salts**: Bile salts stimulate vitamin D receptors, allowing vitamin D to work more effectively in the body, which can benefit psoriasis.

\- **Intermittent Fasting**: Combining intermittent fasting with a ketogenic diet can significantly lower insulin levels and improve skin conditions. Limiting your eating window each day gives your body a chance to rest and repair, which can benefit skin health.

By taking charge of your diet and incorporating these elements, you can actively manage symptoms of psoriasis and improve overall skin health. Remember, always consult with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for your individual needs.
