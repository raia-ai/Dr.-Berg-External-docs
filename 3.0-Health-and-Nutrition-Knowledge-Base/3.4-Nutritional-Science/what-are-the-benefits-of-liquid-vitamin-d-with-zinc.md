# What are the benefits of Liquid Vitamin D with Zinc?

Liquid Vitamin D with Zinc is a new daily supplement, in the form of easy-to-use oral drops, for both children and adults. Our top-tier formula contains high-quality vitamin D3 enhanced with zinc.

This supplement can be used on a daily basis to promote healthy vitamin D levels and support healthy bones, muscles, skin, digestion, brain function, eyes, fertility, cells and immune system function. It’s also a great way to promote the health and well-being of children who aren’t able to take traditional vitamin D pills and capsules.

There is no easier way to get a daily boost of vitamin D3 and zinc. People often think of vitamin D only as a vitamin that controls calcium levels and bone density—but the role of vitamin D extends much farther. While vitamin D meets the definition of a vitamin, it also functions as a steroid hormone.

When used together, vitamin D and zinc have several combined effects. Zinc acts as an immunity booster and can cut the duration of common cold symptoms. Vitamin D and zinc work together to support strong bones by preventing bone resorption and promoting bone mineralization.
