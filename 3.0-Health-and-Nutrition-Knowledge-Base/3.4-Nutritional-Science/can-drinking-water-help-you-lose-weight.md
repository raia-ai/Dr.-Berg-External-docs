# Can drinking water help you lose weight?

**Water for Weight Loss**

• The water will replace calories from food that could cause you to eat less, and eating less causes to lose more weight.

• Reduced hunger – Let your body adapt to the burning of fat to make your hunger completely go away.

• Stimulates metabolism – This is NOT true. Lowering the dominating hormones (estrogen, insulin, and cortisol) that can nullify all 6 fat-burning hormones can stimulate the metabolism - also with exercise and good quality of sleep.

**Ways to Reduce Hunger:**

• Lower insulin – Insulin is the key hormone that makes you hungry. Reduce insulin by reducing carbs and decrease the frequency of eating.

• Lower estrogen.

• Lower cortisol.

• Exercise.

• Sleep.
