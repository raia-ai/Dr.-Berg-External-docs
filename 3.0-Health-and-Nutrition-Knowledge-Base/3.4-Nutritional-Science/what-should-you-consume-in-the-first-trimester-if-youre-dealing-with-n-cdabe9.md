# What should you consume in the first trimester if youâ€™re dealing with nausea and food aversions?

The most important thing is the diet. I would be careful about doing the rice.

I would go back to what I recommend is the basic keto plan and find out maybe instead of doing heavy fatty foods you do. You do like maybe less fatty foods, but you definitely need animal source nutrients for the best bioavailable source of amino acids and nutrition, because this is the time where that that baby is being fortified and developing. And so you don't want to have any deficiencies.
