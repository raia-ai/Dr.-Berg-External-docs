# What strategies can be implemented to prevent fatty liver disease while losing weight?

In the book of medical physiology, there’s a section that says, “Effect of insulin lack on causing a fatty liver. Strange as it may seem, though insulin lack causes dissolution of the fat store in adipose tissue, it causes a great increase in the amount of stored triglycerides in the liver, leading to a very fatty liver.”

This means that when you lower your insulin and start burning a lot of fat, you are at risk of making your liver fatty. There are two things I want to cover on how to avoid a fatty liver when you lose weight.

**#1 You have to keep your diet high in vegetables. You need at least 7-8 cups of vegetables a day. Vegetables help clean the liver and prevent fat build-up. Avoid corn and have raw leafy greens. Kale shakes are great for getting more vegetables in your diet.**

**#2 Have apple cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar is really really good for the liver and to help dissolve a fatty liver and clean it up.**

Egg yolks are also very good for cleaning up a fatty liver. They contain B vitamins (choline) and Lecithin.
