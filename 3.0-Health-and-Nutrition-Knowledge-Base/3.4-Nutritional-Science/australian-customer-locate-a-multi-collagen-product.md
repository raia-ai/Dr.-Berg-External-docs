# Australian Customer Locate a Multi Collagen Product

While we don’t have a specific brand recommendation, if our Multi Collagen Peptides are unavailable in Australia, here are some best practices to help you choose a high-quality collagen supplement with similar benefits:

Match the collagen types – Look for a blend that includes Types I, II, III, V, and X, ideally from grass-fed bovine and wild-caught sources.

Added nutrients – Collagen works best when paired with vitamin C and biotin to support absorption and benefits for skin, hair, and joints.

Clean and certified – Choose products that are third-party tested, non-GMO, glyphosate-free, and free from artificial fillers.

Locally sourced – Australian-made products ensure freshness and often follow strict quality standards, while adhering to local requirements.

Mixability and taste – Unflavored or lightly flavored collagen powders that dissolve easily make daily use more convenient.
