# How does diet influence sleep quality, and what specific foods or nutritional habits can enhance or disrupt restful sleep?

On a high-carb, low-fat diet, you’re going to be more deficient in zinc. Zinc can greatly influence parts of the brain that control sleep. If you have a sleeping problem, taking zinc before bed may help. You will also be hungry all of the time. On the other hand, if you’re on a low-carb, high-fat diet, you won’t be as deficient in zinc. You will also have decreased hunger.

If you have poor sleep (in quality and quantity), you will notice an increase in the desire to eat. Poor sleep equals more hunger. One study found that poor REM sleep increases the absorption of glucose, which spikes blood sugars, which affects insulin, which makes you hungry. Also, if you’re not sleeping, you could have high cortisol, which can also lead to an increased appetite.
