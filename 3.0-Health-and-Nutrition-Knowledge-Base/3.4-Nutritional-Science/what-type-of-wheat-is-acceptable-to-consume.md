# What type of wheat is acceptable to consume?

Typical wheat products like bread and pasta are made with the seed, or grain, of the wheat plant. Wheatgrass is the actual plant that the seed grows on. The type of wheatgrass used in wheatgrass juice is at an early stage—usually less than ten days old. I think how healthy wheatgrass is for you depends on what it’s grown on. Wheatgrass grown on soil may be more beneficial than wheatgrass grown in other ways.

**Wheatgrass juice powder may also be more beneficial than wheatgrass powder products. Wheatgrass juice powder is more concentrated because it doesn’t contain any fiber.** One of the advantages of wheatgrass juice powder over wheatgrass powder is that people can consume it even if they can’t consume fiber. Unlike grain, wheatgrass is gluten-free and is low in anti-nutrients, tannins, and oxalates. Wheatgrass juice powder grown on good soil is low-carb and rich in vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, and amino acids.

**However, I consume wheatgrass juice powder for two main reasons:**

1\. 70% of wheatgrass is chlorophyll

2\. It’s rich in phytonutrients

Both chlorophyll and phytonutrients have a wealth of beneficial properties. Research is also being done on using wheatgrass for a genetic type of anemia called thalassemia. Growing your own wheatgrass to make wheatgrass juice is inexpensive and pretty simple. Give it a try!
