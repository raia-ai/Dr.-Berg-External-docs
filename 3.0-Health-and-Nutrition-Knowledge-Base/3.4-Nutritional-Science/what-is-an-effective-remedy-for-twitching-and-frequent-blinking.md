# What is an effective remedy for twitching and frequent blinking?

Involuntary muscle movements like twitching and frequent blinking can stem from conditions such as Tourette's syndrome, Tardive Dyskinesia, Dystonia, or side effects from certain medications. Damage to the extrapyramidal part of the brain, which regulates these movements, can also be a factor.

Research suggests that sufficient manganese intake, around 10mg three times daily, may help improve these symptoms by supporting the function of the extrapyramidal system. When taking manganese supplements, it's advisable to also supplement with magnesium and vitamin B3 (niacin) for optimal efficacy.
