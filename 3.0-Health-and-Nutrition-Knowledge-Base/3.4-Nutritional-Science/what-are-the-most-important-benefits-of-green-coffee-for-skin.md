# What are the most important benefits of green coffee for skin?

Many people are using coffee scrubs and masks made of roasted coffee grounds, and are seeing incredible results. For even better results, you can make a facial mask with green coffee powder, which is made from unroasted coffee beans.

You can buy green coffee powder at a health food store, online, or you can even grind green coffee beans to make your own powder. Mix one tablespoon of green coffee powder with one tablespoon of water. Apply it to your face, and let it dry for 15 minutes, then wash it off.

The phytochemicals combined with the caffeine will give you a healthy glow. If your skin is extra dry, substitute one tablespoon of olive oil for the water. Leave it on for 20 minutes, and then wipe it off.
