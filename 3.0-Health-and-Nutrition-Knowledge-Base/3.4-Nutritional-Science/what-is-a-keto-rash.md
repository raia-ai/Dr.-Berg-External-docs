# What is a keto rash?

Dr. Berg’s theory is that there are high levels of histamines being dumped into the liver. When you switch over to the keto diet, or you’re running on ketones, you’re releasing a lot of fat that’s coming out through the liver. That fat holds a lot of stuff like chemicals and toxins.

But if you don’t have a lot of bile in your gallbladder and you do a ketogenic diet, you might not be able to release the toxins that are coming out with the fat. This could create an immune reaction with the histamines. One of the purposes of bile is to break down fats. The other is to eliminate toxins. Basically, you’re trying to get rid of these toxins, but you don’t have enough bile to handle the fat being released on the keto diet, so you end up with a rash.

A great potential keto rash remedy is to add purified bile salts. This could help increase the flow of the bile through the liver and gallbladder to help eliminate toxins a lot better and reduce the keto rash that’s occurring.
