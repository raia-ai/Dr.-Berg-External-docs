# What nutrient deficiencies are commonly linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?

The most common nutrient deficiencies in individuals with IBD are:

1\. **Iron Deficiency**: Due to blood loss and decreased absorption from inflammation, 80% of those with IBD are iron deficient, which can lead to anemia. The best sources of iron are animal products (especially beef and organ meats) and spirulina. It's advisable to get iron from food rather than supplements to avoid excess buildup.

2\. **Vitamin D Deficiency**: Affecting 70% of those with IBD, inflammation hinders dietary vitamin D absorption. Factors like age, weight, skin tone, and location also impact levels. Vitamin D is crucial for calcium absorption, repairing the small intestine lining, and reducing inflammation. A daily intake of 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3 is recommended.

3\. **Vitamin B12 and B9 (Folate) Deficiency**: These vitamins come from diet and gut microbes. Gut inflammation can reduce beneficial bacteria, limiting B vitamin production and absorption. Deficiencies can cause fatigue, anemia, and other health issues.

4\. **Vitamin K1 and K2 Deficiency**: An unhealthy gut can decrease levels of these vitamins, which are produced by gut microbes. Vitamin K1 aids blood clotting, while K2 supports bone strength and prevents calcium buildup in arteries and joints. Replenishing these nutrients is essential for those with IBD.
