# What Your Urine Color Says about Your Health

**What Your Urine Color Means**

Urine is filtered blood. Your kidneys work to recycle essential substances while removing waste products as urine. Here's what your urine color might indicate:

- **Clear:** You're likely overhydrated. Proper hydration means balancing electrolytes with the right water intake. Drink when thirsty, especially during exercise or when sweating.

- **Normal Colors:** Aim for amber, yellow, or straw-colored urine. The yellow comes from a blood pigment.

- **Red/Pink:** Often means blood is present. Seek medical advice as this can indicate kidney stones, infections, menstruation, or more serious concerns.

- **Orange/Fluorescent Yellow:** Usually caused by vitamins (especially B vitamins), certain medications, or food dyes. Rarely, it might signal liver or gallbladder issues.

- **Blue/Green:** Could be due to dyes in food or medications, or medical conditions. Asparagus can sometimes turn urine green!

- **Dark Brown:** A sign of dehydration. Very dark brown urine could rarely indicate liver problems.

**Other Indicators**

- **Foamy Urine:** May mean high protein intake or, less commonly, kidney issues. Consider reducing protein and seeing if it improves.

- **Cloudy Urine:** Usually indicates an infection, like a UTI. Excess dietary sugar can contribute to UTIs.
