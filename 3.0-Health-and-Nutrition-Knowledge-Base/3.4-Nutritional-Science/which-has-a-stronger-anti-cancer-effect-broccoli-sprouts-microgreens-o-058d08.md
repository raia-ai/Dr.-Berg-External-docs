# Which has a stronger anti-cancer effect: broccoli sprouts, microgreens, or radish sprouts, and how do their benefits compare?

There's some new research out which I just created a video on that talks, compares these two sprouts. And apparently the radish sprout has a more potent effect on cancer. I'm sure they're both great. But radish sprouts have that X factor.

Radishes are interesting because they tend to pull mucus from the body. They're very high in sulfur and they pull mucus from the deeper parts of the lung, the lymphatic system. They're a great cleaner. They're great for sinus congestion.
