# How does calcification happen?

Picture this: your cells are little cities. They need the right balance of minerals to function smoothly. When you don't have enough magnesium, calcium can build up inside those cells, causing dysfunction and, eventually, cell death.

This can contribute to heart disease, kidney stones, and even vision problems.

Think of magnesium as the "chill pill" for your cells, preventing this dangerous calcium buildup. It ensures that calcium is directed to the right places.

Now, this isn't an overnight thing. Pathological calcification builds slowly over time, often silently. And there are other factors at play - inflammation is a huge driver. But, magnesium deficiency is a major player we can actually do something about.
