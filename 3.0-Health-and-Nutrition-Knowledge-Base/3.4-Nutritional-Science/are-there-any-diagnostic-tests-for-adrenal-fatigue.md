## **Diagnostic Tests for Adrenal Dysfunction**

When it comes to adrenal dysfunction, early detection is crucial. Let's explore a few ways to identify this disorder.

### **Raglan's Test**

The Raglan's test gauges blood pressure variations when transitioning from lying down to standing up. In healthy individuals, the systolic (upper) number usually rises slightly.

If your [systolic pressure](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-is-my-systolic-blood-pressure-high) does not increase or decrease, it could indicate adrenal fatigue. This quick and easy home test provides valuable insights, but remember - it shouldn’t replace professional medical advice.

### **CO2 Tolerance Test**

This one measures how long you can exhale after a deep breath – like blowing out birthday candles, except these won't get you any gifts. Check out more on CO2 tolerance testing here.

A shorter exhalation time could indicate low carbon dioxide levels in your body - another possible sign of adrenal dysfunction. But don't worry. If the results seem off, there are ways to fix this.
