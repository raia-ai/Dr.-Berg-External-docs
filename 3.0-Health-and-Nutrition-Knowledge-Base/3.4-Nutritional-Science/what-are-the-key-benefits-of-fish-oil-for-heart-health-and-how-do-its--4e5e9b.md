# What are the key benefits of fish oil for heart health, and how do its omega-3s support heart function, reduce inflammation, and prevent disease?

**Health benefits of fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids):**

• They are antiarrhythmic

• They are anti-inflammatory

• They trigger genes that can help turn off the fibrosis effect of the heart

• They are antithrombotic

• They support the endothelial layer in the arteries

• They can help make your cell membranes more fluid and less rigid

Omega-6 fatty acids are common in oils like vegetable oils and seed oils. These oils invade cell membranes and make them more rigid. It’s crucial to have the correct ratio of omega-3 fatty acids to omega-6 fatty acids, which should be 1:1. The average person in the US has a 15:1 ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids not only increase the risk of heart problems but many other health issues. Omega-6 fatty acids also compete with omega-3 fatty acids. So keep in mind that the more omega-6 fatty acids you have in your diet, the less of an effect you will have from omega-3 fatty acids.
