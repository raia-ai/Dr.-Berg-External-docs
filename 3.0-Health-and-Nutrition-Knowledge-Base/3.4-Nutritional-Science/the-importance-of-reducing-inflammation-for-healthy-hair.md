# The Importance of Reducing Inflammation for Healthy Hair

[Inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-inflammation-factor-in-common-diseases) is another factor that can contribute to hair loss, as it can damage hair follicles and disrupt the hair growth cycle. One common cause of inflammation is an imbalance of [omega-6 and omega-3](https://www.drberg.com/blog/get-your-omega-6-to-omega-3-ratios-balanced) fatty acids in the diet.

[Omega-6 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-6-fats-and-inflammation), which are found in many processed and fried foods, can promote inflammation in the body. On the other hand, [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/basics-of-omega-3-fatty-acids), which are found in fatty fish, nuts, and seeds, have anti-inflammatory properties.

To reduce inflammation and support healthy hair growth, it's important to limit your intake of omega-6-rich foods and increase your intake of omega-3s. Some good sources of omega-3s include:

- Fatty fish, such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel

- Flaxseeds and chia seeds

- Walnuts and almonds

- Avocados

By reducing inflammation in the body, you can create a more hospitable environment for healthy hair growth.

### **Balancing Hormones Through Diet**

Hormonal imbalances can also contribute to hair loss, particularly in women. Estrogen, in particular, plays a key role in promoting healthy hair growth, while an excess of androgens like DHT can lead to hair thinning and shedding.

To help balance hormones and support healthy hair growth, it's important to include plenty of hormone-balancing foods in your diet. Some good options include:

- Cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli and cauliflower, which contain compounds that help regulate estrogen levels

- Soy products, such as tofu and tempeh, which contain phytoestrogens that can help balance hormones

- Healthy fats, such as avocados and nuts, which are important for hormone production and balance

- Adaptogenic herbs, such as ashwagandha and maca, which can help regulate the stress response and balance hormones

By incorporating these hormone-balancing foods into your diet, you can help create a more balanced hormonal environment that supports healthy hair growth.
