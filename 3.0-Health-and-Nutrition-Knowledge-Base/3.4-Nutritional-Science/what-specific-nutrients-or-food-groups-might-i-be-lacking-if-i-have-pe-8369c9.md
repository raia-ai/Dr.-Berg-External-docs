# What specific nutrients or food groups might I be lacking if I have persistent dry lips?

Dry lips are often due to a deficiency in essential fatty acids, not a lack of water. Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D can help. Incorporate fatty fish and other seafood into your diet to provide these nutrients and alleviate dry, chapped lips.
