# What effective strategies and practices can I implement to enhance my stamina and endurance over time?

To improve your stamina, consider these key strategies:

1\. **Tocotrienols:** Enhance oxygen delivery to muscles, improving endurance and reducing fatigue.

2\. **Methylene Blue:** Temporarily boosts mitochondrial function, providing more oxygen for exercise, especially beneficial for smokers or those with mitochondrial damage.

Exercise is crucial for overall health, offsetting genetic weaknesses and improving cardiovascular health, even with poor sleep. Consistency in exercise is vital. Additionally, ensure your diet includes sufficient protein to support stamina and endurance.
