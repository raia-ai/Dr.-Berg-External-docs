# What are the most important foods for shinier and healthier hair?

1\. Bamboo shoots are high in trace minerals, potassium, and silica—essential for building hair protein. Silica makes hair strong and elastic and also prevents breakage and brittleness. Silica supports skin, joint, and bone health as well!

2\. Wild-caught salmon is an excellent source of protein and is loaded with nutrition. It’s also one of the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Wild-caught salmon is a potent source of vitamin D3, which can improve nearly every problem with hair loss. Vitamin D controls the hair follicle and can activate dormant hair follicle stem cells.

3\. Egg yolks are loaded with biotin, vital for keratin production. They also contain all of the fat-soluble nutrients that are essential for hair growth and hair health. Egg yolks are a rich source of cholesterol, a precursor for the hormones necessary for hair growth. Cholesterol increases hair shine and luster and strengthens the hair shaft. Egg yolks contain vitamin D and sulfur, which supports a healthy scalp.

4\. Grass-fed liver contains concentrated amounts of almost every nutrient. It’s high in iron, vital for oxygen transport to the scalp. One of the most common causes of hair shedding is iron deficiency. An iron deficiency can be caused by low iron or a copper deficiency.
