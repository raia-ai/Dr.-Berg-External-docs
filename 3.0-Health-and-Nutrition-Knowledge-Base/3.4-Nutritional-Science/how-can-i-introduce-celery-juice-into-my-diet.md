# How can I introduce celery juice into my diet?

**Incorporating Celery Juice into Your Diet**

**Selecting Fresh Celery:** Opt for fresh, organic celery to ensure high-quality juice free from pesticides and chemicals.

**Juicing Tips:** Use a high-quality juicer designed for fibrous vegetables. Drink the juice immediately to maximize nutrient retention. If storing, use an airtight container and refrigerate for no more than 24 hours.

**Optimal Timing:** For best results, consume celery juice first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. If needed, dilute with water or add a squeeze of lemon for flavor. Allow 15-30 minutes before eating other foods.

Incorporating these practices will help you reap the full benefits of celery juice, including enhanced hydration and nutrient intake.
