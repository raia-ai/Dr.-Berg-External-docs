# Exercise Considerations During a Prolonged Fast & Safety

An appropriate level of physical activity is acceptable during a prolonged fast.  Below are guidelines for exercise while fasting. 

1. **Choose Light Activities**: During a prolonged fast, engaging in light physical activities such as walking or yoga is advisable. These types of exercises help maintain muscle mass without excessively draining energy reserves. 

3. **Avoid High-Intensity Workouts**: High-intensity exercise is too demanding during a prolonged fast. It significantly increases fatigue and demands on nutrient reserves, increasing muscle loss risk due to the lack of calorie intake. 

4. **Focus on Recovery**: Since the body's recovery might be reduced during a fast, ensuring adequate rest and recovery time between physical activities is crucial. 

5. **Monitor Your Body's Response**: Pay close attention to how your body responds to exercise during fasting. If you experience unusual fatigue, dizziness, or other concerning symptoms, reducing the intensity or duration of your workouts is advised. 

These recommendations aim to balance the benefits of exercise with the need to conserve energy and prevent adverse effects during a prolonged fast.
