# What is the gallbladder?

The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile. Bile is the fluid that dissolves dietary fat into small particles, lubricates the colon, and alkalizes the stomach acid. Your bile also kills bacteria in your food. The gallbladder is located below the right ribcage, just below the liver.

The pancreas releases its enzyme (lipase) to fully break down fat into the smallest elements (fatty acids).

Without enough bile, you can experience:

• Bloating

• Dry skin

• Constipation

• Floating stool

• Anal leakage

• Bad stool odors

• Pale-colored stool

• Digestive pain

• Poor mood

• Inflammation

• Poor heart health
