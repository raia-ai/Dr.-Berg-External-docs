# Can I eat quinoa on Keto?

Quinoa is a seed from a tall leafy plant that grows up to 3 to 9ft. It is very low on the glycemic index but it can still spike your blood sugars. It is gluten-free but it is processed in many factories that also process wheat - so it could be exposed to glute. And it has a similar compound to gluten that could also create a similar inflammatory reaction in the gut.
