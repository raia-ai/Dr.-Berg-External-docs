# What are some really serious symptoms of potassium deficiency?

Extremely low potassium levels can be life-threatening. Seek immediate medical help if you experience the following potassium deficiency symptoms:

- Severe Muscle Weakness: This goes beyond general weakness and involves your muscles not functioning as they should. Severe muscle weakness might even lead to paralysis.

- Difficulty Breathing: This occurs because low potassium can disrupt the muscle function involved in breathing.

- Confusion and Mood Changes: This symptom is more than just brain fog. With severe potassium deficiency, you can become confused or disoriented and have sudden, extreme mood shifts.
