# Are there potential Hibiscus tea pregnancy risks?

Hibiscus increases blood flow to the uterus. This can stimulate menstruation during the early stages of pregnancy, which increases the risk of miscarriage. Hibiscus may also potentially trigger uterine contractions during the third trimester, increasing the risk of preterm labor.
