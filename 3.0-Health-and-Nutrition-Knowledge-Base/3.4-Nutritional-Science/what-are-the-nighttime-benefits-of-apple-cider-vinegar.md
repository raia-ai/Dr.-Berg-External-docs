# What are the nighttime benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar?

1\. Healthy blood sugar levels The main ingredient in apple cider vinegar is acetic acid, which can stabilize blood sugar when you go to bed. ACV can significantly improve insulin resistance. It slows the breakdown of sugar and starches to reduce the insulin spike after eating.

2\. Better sleep One to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water before bed can help you sleep better.

3\. Improved digestion Apple cider vinegar can reduce bloating and improve digestion. This can improve sleep and eliminate heartburn at night.

4\. Improves mineral absorption Apple cider vinegar can improve the absorption of important minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and potassium. It can alleviate symptoms of magnesium deficiency like tetany or leg cramps by improving magnesium absorption. If your stomach is too alkaline, mineral absorption will be inhibited.

5\. Weight loss ACV helps you lose weight by increasing insulin sensitivity and improving insulin resistance.

6\. Improved liver detoxification ACV can improve liver detoxification and increase the release of bile. Bile improves the digestion of fat.

7\. ACV for fuel The body can use acetic acid as fuel. This wonâ€™t keep you up at night because it takes a good amount of energy to sleep restfully!
