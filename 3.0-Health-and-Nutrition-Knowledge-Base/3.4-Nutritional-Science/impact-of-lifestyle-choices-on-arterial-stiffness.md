# Impact of Lifestyle Choices on Arterial Stiffness

While Vitamin K2 is a key player in arterial health, it's not the only factor to consider. Our lifestyle choices, from the foods we eat to the medications we take, can have a big impact on the flexibility and function of our arteries.

### **The Double-Edged Sword of Calcium Supplements**

[Calcium supplements](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-your-calcium-supplement-killing-you) are often touted as a way to support bone health, especially for older adults. However, taking high doses of calcium without adequate Vitamin K2 can actually do more harm than good.

Excess calcium that isn't properly directed into the bones can end up in the arteries, contributing to calcification and stiffness. In fact, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3690285) have shown that taking calcium supplements without Vitamin K2 can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

If you do take calcium supplements, make sure you're balancing them with adequate K2.

### **Medication-Induced Risks for Arterial Health**

Certain medications can also have unintended consequences for arterial health. Warfarin, a common blood thinner, works by blocking the activity of Vitamin K1 in the liver.

However, it also inhibits Vitamin K2, which can lead to increased arterial calcification over time. If you're on Warfarin or a similar medication, talk to your doctor about monitoring your Vitamin K2 levels and considering supplementation if necessary.

### **Diet's Role in Arterial Flexibility**

Finally, the foods we eat every day can have a big impact on the health and flexibility of our arteries. A low-carb, anti-inflammatory diet can be particularly beneficial.

By reducing inflammation in the body, a low-carb diet can help prevent arterial damage and stiffening that can lead to heart disease.

It's also important to limit omega-6 fatty acids, found in vegetable oils and processed foods, as these can promote inflammation in the arteries.

In contrast, omega-3 fatty acids from fish and fish oil supplements have anti-inflammatory properties that can help keep arteries supple and healthy.

By making smart dietary choices and being mindful of the medications we take, we can create a lifestyle that supports healthy, flexible arteries well into old age.
