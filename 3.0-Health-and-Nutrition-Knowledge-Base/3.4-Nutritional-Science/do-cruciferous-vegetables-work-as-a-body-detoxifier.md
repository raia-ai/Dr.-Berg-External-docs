# Do cruciferous vegetables work as a body detoxifier?

Cruciferous vegetables are able to help the liver detoxify by supporting phase 1 and 2 enzymatic biotransformations.

This means your body has the ability to dismantle poisons into harmless water-soluble particles.

Cruciferous vegetables—and a concentrated cruciferous vegetable phytochemical known as DIM—promotes healthy phase I detoxification and balances phase II detoxification. This allows your body to, once again, detoxify normally. The enzymes involved are called cytochrome P450.
