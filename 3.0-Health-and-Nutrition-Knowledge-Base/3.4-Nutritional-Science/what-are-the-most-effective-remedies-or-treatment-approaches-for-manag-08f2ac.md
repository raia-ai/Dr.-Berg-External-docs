# What are the most effective remedies or treatment approaches for managing cataracts, and how do these methods work to slow their progression or improve vision?

Typical treatments for cataracts have side effects, so today we’re going to talk about natural alternatives for cataracts.

The eyes are highly affected by your blood sugar levels. When your blood sugar is high, it creates a lot of oxidative stress in different tissues, including the eyes.

Our bodies produce antioxidants to protect against this oxidation and free radical damage. But certain things, like age and diet, can cause our bodies to make fewer antioxidants. However, plants also make potent antioxidants that we can take advantage of to help counter the effects of oxidative stress. The two categories that we’re focusing on today are carotenoids and anthocyanins.

**Foods high in carotenoids:**

• Yellow, orange, red, and purple vegetables

• Pasture-raised egg yolks

• Grass-fed meats

**Foods high in anthocyanins:**

• Bilberries

• Blueberries

• Blackberries

• Chokeberries

• Black currant

• Red cabbage

**Here is the best natural remedy to potentially help with cataracts.**

**Ingredients:**

• 1 cup berries

• 1 cup kefir (grass-fed, whole milk, unsweetened)
