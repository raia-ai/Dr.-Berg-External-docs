# What are some highly regarded magnesium supplements that have demonstrated effectiveness in addressing deficiencies and supporting overall health?

While getting magnesium from food is ideal, supplementation can be beneficial if you struggle to meet your needs through diet alone. However, it is advisable to consult with your doctor to determine the proper dosage and type of supplement best suited for you.

Several forms of magnesium supplements are available, including:

- Magnesium Citrate: Often recommended for its high bioavailability and potential laxative effects.

- Magnesium Glycinate: Known for its high absorption rate and ability to promote relaxation.

- Magnesium Oxide: A common form found in many supplements, but it has lower bioavailability compared to other types.
