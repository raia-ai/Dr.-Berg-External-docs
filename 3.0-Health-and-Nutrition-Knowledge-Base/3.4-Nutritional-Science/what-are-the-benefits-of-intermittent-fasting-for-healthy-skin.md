# What are the benefits of intermittent fasting for healthy skin?

Intermittent fasting has many great benefits for the skin. For instance, it can delay vascular cell deterioration while preventing oxidative stress. It can also stimulate autophagy (cell repair) and boost stem cell production. It also lowers inflammation because glycogen in the skin is reduced. Anti-aging effects can be seen in the skin through fasting as well, because more elastin is produced by the body.
