# What is ocular myasthenia gravis?

**Myasthenia Gravis and Vitamin D: A Promising Case Study**

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease that disrupts the communication between nerves and muscles, leading to muscle weakness. While steroids are a common treatment, they can have harsh side effects.

**A Brazilian Case Study**

Intriguingly, a Brazilian doctor treated an MG patient using high-dose vitamin D3 (80,000 - 120,000 IUs). Remarkably, the patient's symptoms went into remission.

**Potential Benefits**

- **Hormone-like Action:** Vitamin D may mimic some of the effects of steroids, potentially without the same side effects.

- **Immune Regulation:** Vitamin D supports T regulatory cells, which play a crucial role in preventing autoimmune reactions.

- **The Vitamin D Connection:** Many autoimmune diseases, including MG, are linked to vitamin D deficiency.

**Important Considerations**

- **Hypercalcemia Risk:** High-dose vitamin D can raise blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia), increasing the risk of kidney stones. Precautions like omitting dietary calcium and increasing fluids may be helpful.
