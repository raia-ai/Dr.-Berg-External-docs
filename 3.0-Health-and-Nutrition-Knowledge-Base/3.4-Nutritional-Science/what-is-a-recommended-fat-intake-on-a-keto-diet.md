# What is a recommended fat intake on a Keto diet?

When you first start keto and intermittent fasting, you’re going to need more fat. As you progress, you’ll need to consume less fat because your body is eating its own fat. The best way to judge how much fat you need is to base it on your hunger.

Eat enough fat to keep you comfortable and full between meals but not so much that you feel stuffed. On average, you’d consume:

**140 grams per day if you’re consuming three meals; 113 grams per day if two meals;**

**86 grams per day if you’re eating one meal per day.**

The meal plans on drberg.com, under Recipes, already have these keto macro amounts built into them.
