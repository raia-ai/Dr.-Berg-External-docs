# What are some effective strategies for managing sugar intake in children?

As parents, it's our responsibility to help children develop healthy eating habits, particularly in managing sugar intake. By implementing informed strategies, we can support their physical and emotional well-being.

**Understanding Labels:**

\- **Hidden Sugars:** Learn to identify added sugars on labels, such as high fructose corn syrup, glucose, and dextrose. Even "natural" sugars like honey and maple syrup contribute to overall sugar intake and should be consumed in moderation.

\- **Vigilance:** Familiarize yourself with the various names for sugar to make informed food choices for your family.

**Healthy Alternatives:**

\- **Whole Foods:** Replace sugary snacks with naturally sweet and nutritious options like fresh fruits (berries, apples) and vegetables (carrots, bell peppers) paired with hummus or nut butter.

\- **Beverage Choices:** Encourage water, unsweetened herbal teas, or low-fat milk over sugary drinks. For flavored drinks, try infusing water with fresh fruit slices or mint for a refreshing, natural sweetness.

By making these mindful changes, you can help your child maintain a balanced diet and develop healthy lifelong habits.
