# What are the most effective methods for eliminating candida overgrowth, and what steps should be taken to address and prevent it?

**Candida is a fungal infection that typically affects the mouth, private areas, or toenails. Candida often develops after antibiotics destroys the bacteria that keep yeast and fungus at bay.**

The majority of your gut microbiome is bacteria. However, you have a small percentage of yeast, fungus, and friendly candida. When antibiotics wipe out your friendly bacteria, this leaves room for candida overgrowth.

**Some of the symptoms of candida overgrowth include itchiness, burning, fatigue, cracks at the corners of the mouth, and ammonia odor.**

Candida changes your pH, making it more alkaline. Sugar is the primary fuel source of candida.

**Other conditions can lower your immune system and cause candida overgrowth. HIV/AIDS, organ transplants, medications like Prednisone, pregnancy, and excessive sugar consumption can all cause candida.**

**Oftentimes, candida overgrowth is paired with a vitamin D deficiency.** Vitamin D has antifungal properties and is also a broad-spectrum antimicrobial.

**If you have candida, there are three things that you need to do!**

1\. Take 20,000 to 30,000 IU of vitamin D

2\. Remove sugar from the diet

3\. Consume probiotic foods (sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, fermented vegetables)
