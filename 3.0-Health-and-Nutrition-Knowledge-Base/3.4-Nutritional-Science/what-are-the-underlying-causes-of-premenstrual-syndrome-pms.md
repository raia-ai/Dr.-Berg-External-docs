# What are the underlying causes of premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a condition that affects your emotions, behavior and physical comfort or discomfort, just before the menstrual cycle--and sometimes during it as well.

Symptoms that you may experience prior to or during the menstrual cycle:

- Cramps

- Mood swings

- Nervousness

- Fatigue

- Depression

- Irritability

- Breast tenderness

- Sugar/carb cravings

- Headaches

- Hot flashes

- Breast aches

**Cause #1: High estrogen**

There is a connection between high estrogen (female hormone) and PMS symptoms. If your body has high amounts of estrogen from your diet or from other causes, like having a high percentage of body fat, this factor can cause many difficulties prior to the menstrual cycle as well as during it.
