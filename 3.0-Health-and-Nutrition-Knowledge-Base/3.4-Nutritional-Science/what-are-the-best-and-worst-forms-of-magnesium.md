# What are the best and worst forms of magnesium?

Magnesium supplements aren't all created equal. Let's break down the different forms, ranking them from least to most effective, so you can make an informed choice.

### The Not-So-Great

1. **Magnesium Oxide:** While common and often pricey, it has a dismal 4% absorption rate, making it the least effective option.

2. **Magnesium Sulfate:** At 10% absorption, it's slightly better but known for its laxative effect. It might offer some superficial muscle relaxation.

### The Middling

3. **Magnesium Orotate:** With 15% absorption, it can penetrate cells for energy boosts, act as an antioxidant, and support DNA health.

4. **Magnesium Taurate:** At 20% absorption, it's good for your heart, blood pressure, and nervous system.

5. **Magnesium Lactate:** A gentler option at 25% absorption, it benefits your cardiovascular system, energy levels, and may be useful for muscle health when applied topically.

6. **Magnesium Citrate:** A solid 30% absorption makes it helpful for preventing kidney stones, improving cardiovascular health, managing blood pressure, and aiding detoxification.

### The Top Performers

7. **Magnesium Malate:** Boasting a 40% absorption rate, it's particularly beneficial for those with chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia.

8. **Magnesium Threonate:** An impressive 75% absorption makes it a brain booster, enhancing cognitive function and promoting better sleep.

### The Gold Standard

9. **Magnesium Glycinate:** The champion with the highest absorption rate. It's gentle on your stomach, helps prevent muscle spasms, promotes relaxation and sleep, and may even ease migraines without interfering with other minerals.

### Dosage Recommendations

- **Maintenance:** 400 mg of magnesium glycinate at night

- **Therapeutic:** Double the dose (800 mg) and spread it throughout the day

Remember, always consult your healthcare professional before starting any new supplements to ensure they're right for you.
