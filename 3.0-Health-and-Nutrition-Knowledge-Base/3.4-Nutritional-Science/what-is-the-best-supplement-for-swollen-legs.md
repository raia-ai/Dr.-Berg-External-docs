# What is the best supplement for swollen legs?

Swollen legs, commonly associated with edema, are often attributed to liver, kidney, or heart issues. However, there's a chance you can address edema and pitting edema without resorting to blood thinners or diuretics.

The root of water retention in the lower legs lies in the sodium-potassium pumps within your cells. If these pumps malfunction, fluid builds up outside the cells, causing interstitial fluid retention.

High blood sugar can lead to swollen ankles due to glycation, a process that hampers the blood's ability to transport oxygen and nutrients. Glycated proteins also obstruct circulation, further contributing to swelling in the legs and ankles. Additionally, high blood sugar promotes sodium retention, which exacerbates water retention and can even result in peripheral neuropathy, causing numbness and tingling in the feet.

To combat edema, prioritize potassium intake, which is challenging to obtain solely through diet. Aim for 4700 mg daily, incorporating foods like avocados and berries. Magnesium is also vital; strive for 420 mg daily through sources like pumpkin seeds and leafy greens. A quality electrolyte powder without added sugars can supplement your intake.

Vitamin B1 deficiency is often linked to sodium-potassium pump issues, as it's essential for converting sugar into energy. Excessive refined carbohydrate consumption can deplete Vitamin B1 levels.

While Vitamin B1, potassium, and magnesium can significantly improve edema, eliminating sugar from your diet is crucial for long-term relief.
