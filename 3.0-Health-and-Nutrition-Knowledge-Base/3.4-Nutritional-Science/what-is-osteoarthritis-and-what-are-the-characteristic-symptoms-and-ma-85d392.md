# What is osteoarthritis, and what are the characteristic symptoms and manifestations of this degenerative joint disease that can impact mobility and quality of life?

Osteoarthritis is a condition where you have degeneration of joints and of the underlying bone. It causes pain and stiffness especially in the hip, knee and thumb joints.

There are a few conditions that can cause osteoarthritis. One of them is similar to rheumatoid arthritis as it was found that there are certain bacteria (that normally live in the mouth) that can go into your joints and damage them.

Additionally if your body is too alkaline, it can also cause osteoarthritis. If your stomach is too alkaline, you will not be able to absorb the calcium that is needed to resolve osteoarthritis.

It has also been found that 75% of people who have insulin resistance (a result of a high- carb diet) also have osteoarthritis. This is because consuming too many carbs and having high amounts of insulin cause inflammation across the body.
