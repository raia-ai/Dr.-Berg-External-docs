# What are the potential causes of red skin spots?

When you have poor blood clotting you may have red, pink or purple spots on your skin. Let’s look at the known remedies for this condition.

**Cause #1: Lack of vitamin K1 and C**

Vitamin K1 and C are very important for a healthy flow of blood through your body. Low levels of vitamin K1 can cause poor blood clotting. If you have low vitamin C, then you may have impaired capillary strength. As a result you can have red, pink or purple spots.

**Cause #2: Poor digestion of the above vitamins**

If you have gallbladder or liver issues, they can cause difficulties in digesting the above vitamins. If you consume enough vitamins from the above sources but the condition doesn’t resolve, it could be due to poor digestion and lack of bile.
