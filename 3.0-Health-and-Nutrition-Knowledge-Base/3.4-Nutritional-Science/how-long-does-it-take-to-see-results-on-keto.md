# How long does it take to see results on keto?

It really depends. When someone begins to do keto and intermittent fasting, they typically lose a lot of water weight in the first week, maybe even 8 pounds.

But then, in the second week, they are hardly losing weight at all: maybe 2 pounds. Well, the maximum amount of fat you can lose per week with a healthy metabolism is only 2 pounds. One half to 2 pounds is actually very good.

Your metabolism is living and dynamic, and it adapts to the foods you eat. When youâ€™re not consistent with keto and intermittent fasting, this can slow down the weight loss and can potentially cause problems.
