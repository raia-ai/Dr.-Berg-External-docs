# How can I fix bad circulation in legs and feet?

According to Dr. Stephen Hussey, author of "Understanding the Heart," the heart spins the blood, acting as a mechanism to create structured water. Similar to the way a tree pushes water up from the roots, increasing structured water throughout the circulatory system can improve circulation. You can increase structured water in your blood with infrared.

Over 50% of the sun's energy is infrared! Increasing sun exposure can help improve the circulation in your legs and your heart function. Infrared increases nitric oxide, which supports the arteries and healthy blood pressure.

Vitamin D from the sun also increases nitric oxide. If you have edema in the feet, potassium is one of the best natural diuretics for getting rid of excess fluid. Eliminating sugar and starches from your diet can also stop fluid retention, especially in the lower extremities. High sugar consumption depletes vitamin B1.

If you’re experiencing tingling and pain in the bottom of your feet, consuming benfotiamine—a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1—may help. Cramping in your legs and feet can also be related to a magnesium deficiency. For the best results, take 800 mg per day in the evening for several weeks. It’s also important to avoid compression socks, which can further restrict blood circulation.

Diosmin is an excellent remedy for varicose veins. If you have varicose veins, edema, or any other problems with the lower part of your body, avoid intense exercise. Instead, aim for light exercise like walking and try these simple leg circulation exercises!

What about cold feet? Cold feet are generally caused by an iodine deficiency due to a low thyroid. Sea kelp is one of the best sources of iodine.
