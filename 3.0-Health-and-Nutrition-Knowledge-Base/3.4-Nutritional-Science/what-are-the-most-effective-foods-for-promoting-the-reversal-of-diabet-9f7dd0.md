# What are the most effective foods for promoting the reversal of diabetes, and how do their nutritional profiles support blood sugar control and overall metabolic health?

To improve blood sugar balance and reverse diabetes, it’s recommended to consume plenty of non-starchy vegetables, grass-fed beef, game meats, wild-caught fish, pasture-raised eggs, and full-fat organic dairy.  These foods don’t significantly spike blood sugar levels, which supports weight loss and helps restore cellular sensitivity to insulin.
