# How much Vitamin K2 and Magnesium do I need?

Vitamin K2 intake recommendations range from 120 mcg daily for men to 90 mcg for women.  

However, if you are taking vitamin D supplementation, it’s crucial to adjust your vitamin K2 dosage to a ratio of 10:1000, which means you should take 10 mcg of vitamin K2 per 1000 IU of vitamin D3.  

The daily intake recommendations for magnesium range from 420 mg for men to 320 mg for women and aren’t dependent on vitamin D supplement dosages.
