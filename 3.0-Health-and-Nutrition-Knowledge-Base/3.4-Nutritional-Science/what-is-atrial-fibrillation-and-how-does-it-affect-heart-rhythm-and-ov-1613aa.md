# What is atrial fibrillation, and how does it affect heart rhythm and overall cardiovascular health?

Atrial fibrillation is when the beats of the heart’s upper chambers—known as the atria—are out of sync with the lower chambers. This causes an erratic and abnormally fast heartbeat. This condition is usually triggered by a magnesium deficiency. It can also be a potassium deficiency. However, it is difficult to determine these mineral differences because of where most of the minerals are located - inside the cell. It is recommended to take a type of magnesium called angstrom, which is 1 million times smaller than other forms.
