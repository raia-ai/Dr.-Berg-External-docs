# What is the correct way to take vitamin D?

Vitamin D is the most important vitamin! It’s a fat-soluble vitamin involved in 10% of our genetics. Vitamin D won’t work unless you have enough magnesium, the second most important nutrient. Magnesium is involved with 300 different enzymes and plays a vital role in regulating excess calcium. Magnesium glycinate supplements have the best absorption rate.

The more vitamin D you take, the more magnesium you’ll need. Some negative side effects associated with vitamin D, such as nausea, heart palpitations, muscle cramps, and headaches, are actually symptoms of a magnesium deficiency. Don’t take vitamin D without the important cofactor, vitamin K2. Vitamin D helps you absorb calcium, but you need vitamin K2 to drive it into the bones and teeth to keep it out of the soft tissues.

Vitamin K2 is best for calcium buildup. Take 100 mcg of vitamin K2 for every 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3.

Zinc is another important cofactor that helps you convert cholesterol into vitamin D. If you’re taking 10,000 IU of vitamin D, you should also take 20 mg of zinc.

One of the biggest vitamin D mistakes is not taking enough! You need at least 6,000 to 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 every day. Vitamin D2 does not work like vitamin D3.

The vitamin D detected in the blood is not the active form. This means you could have normal blood levels of vitamin D but still have vitamin D deficiency. Statins and steroids can inhibit your ability to make vitamin D and its ability to work in your body. The best time to get vitamin D from the sun is between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
