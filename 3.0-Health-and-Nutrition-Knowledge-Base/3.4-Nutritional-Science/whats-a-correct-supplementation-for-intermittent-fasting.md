# What's a correct supplementation for intermittent fasting?

Supplementation of nutrients while fasting is essential for maintaining optimal health.  Here is a list of the fundamental nutrient supplements to take while fasting: 

1. **Electrolytes with Sea Salt** 

Using electrolytes with sea salt while fasting is beneficial for several reasons: 

1. **Hydration Maintenance**: Sea salt contains essential trace minerals that help maintain hydration levels. This is crucial during fasting, as the risk of dehydration increases due to the diuretic effect of fasting, which leads to increased urine production. 

2. **Electrolyte Balance**: Electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and magnesium, found in sea salt, are vital for maintaining proper electrolyte balance. This balance is crucial for various bodily functions, including muscle contraction and nerve function. 

3. **Prevention of Muscle Cramps and Fatigue**: Adequate levels of minerals and electrolytes can help prevent common fasting-related issues such as muscle cramps and fatigue, making the fasting experience more sustainable and safer. 

4. **Supports Energy Production**: Electrolytes play a crucial role in supporting the energy-making processes during fasting by maintaining proper cellular function and overall bodily operations. 

2. **B Vitamin Complex**: The complete B vitamin complex, including B12 and folate, is essential for energy production and maintaining proper nervous system function. 

3. **Trace Minerals** 

Certain trace minerals are vital during prolonged fasting due to their roles in maintaining bodily functions and preventing deficiencies that can be exacerbated during fasting periods. Here are some essential trace minerals and their significance: 

1. **Zinc**: A deficiency in zinc can impact overall health, and maintaining adequate levels helps support enzyme functions and immune health during fasting. 

2. **Iron**: Adequate iron levels are necessary to prevent anemia and ensure oxygen is efficiently transported throughout the body. 

3. **Selenium**: Maintaining selenium levels helps support immune function and protect cells from oxidative stress during fasting. 

4. **Iodine**: Adequate iodine is necessary to maintain metabolic rate and support overall thyroid health. 

A complete trace mineral complex supplement with those listed above is critical to a safe fast.

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do *not* encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records.
