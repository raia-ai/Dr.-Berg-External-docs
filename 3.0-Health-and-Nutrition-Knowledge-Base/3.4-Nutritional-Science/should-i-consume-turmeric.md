# Should I consume turmeric?

You can consume organic turmeric or take a supplement. If you want to take a supplement, it’s best to get a turmeric supplement and not just curcumin. Curcumin is only one of many phytonutrients in turmeric. It’s also important that it’s a freeze-dried supplement. Black pepper or white pepper can help you increase the absorption of turmeric. You can also consume a small amount of fat at the same time for better absorption. Keep in mind that the phytonutrients in turmeric are heat sensitive, so cooking with turmeric could make them less potent.
