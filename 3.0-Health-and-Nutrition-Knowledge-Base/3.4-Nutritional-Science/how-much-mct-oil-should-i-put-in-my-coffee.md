# How much MCT oil should I put in my coffee?

I would do a tablespoon of MCT.If you do too much, you'll have diarrhea or loose bowels.

If you exercise, you know, add another tablespoon, it'll give you more energy because it's gonna generate ketones. If you go too much you're gonna burn that as your fuel more than your own body fat. And if you're trying to increase your weight or maintain your weight, then that's totally fine. But if you're trying to lose weight, you wanna be careful about these extra added fats.
