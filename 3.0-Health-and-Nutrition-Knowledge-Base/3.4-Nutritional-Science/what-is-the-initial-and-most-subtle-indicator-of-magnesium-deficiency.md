# What is the initial and most subtle indicator of magnesium deficiency?

Magnesium deficiency is the most overlooked deficiency because it cannot be detected by a blood test. Sixty percent of magnesium is in the bone, 20% is in the muscle, 19% is in the soft tissue, and 1% is in the blood.

**Neuromuscular excitability, or tetany, is the number 1 earliest sign of a magnesium deficiency. Tetany is a twitching of the muscles, often affecting the left eye.**

Diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease are all associated with low magnesium.
