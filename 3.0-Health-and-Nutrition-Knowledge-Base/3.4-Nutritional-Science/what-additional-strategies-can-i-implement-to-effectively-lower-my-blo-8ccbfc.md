# What additional strategies can I implement to effectively lower my blood sugar and cholesterol levels?

When managing diabetes and insulin resistance, understanding medications like metformin is key. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity, but if blood sugars remain high despite a low-carb diet, it could indicate that insulin receptors need further support or that the liver is producing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources.

To address this, stick to your current diet and consider adding supplements like berberine, apple cider vinegar, and cinnamon, as well as herbs like ginseng and turmeric to support liver function. Healing the liver can take time, sometimes up to three years, but with consistent efforts, you can improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control.
