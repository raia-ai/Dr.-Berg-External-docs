# Which categories of foods are considered the most deleterious to cardiovascular health, potentially exacerbating the risk of heart disease?

**Consuming trans fats increases the risk of several serious health issues, including:**

• Heart attack

• Stroke

• Type 2 diabetes

• Cancer

• Increased LDL

• Decreased HDL

• Inflammation

• Autoimmune diseases

• Infertility

• Tendon and bone degeneration

Partially hydrogenated oils contain trans fats, but products that contain either partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated fats should be avoided to help protect against heart disease and other health problems.

It turns out that animal feed still contains trans fats. This means that you could consume trans fats indirectly by consuming animals fed trans fats. Restaurants also commonly serve foods containing trans fats.

There's even a loophole that allows half of a gram of trans fats in one serving size to claim that a product has zero trans fats. Overall, it's crucial to read food labels and be aware of what you're eating, especially at restaurants.
