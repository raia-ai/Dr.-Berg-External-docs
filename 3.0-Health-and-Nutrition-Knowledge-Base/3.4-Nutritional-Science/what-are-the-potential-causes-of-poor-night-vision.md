# What are the potential causes of poor night vision?

Poor night vision means it’s hard to see during the night or when it is dark. Let’s look at the root cause behind it.

**Symptoms:**

- Can’t see at night

- Disoriented when it’s dark outside

**Cause #1: Vitamin A deficiency**

One of the functions of vitamin A is to sensitize the cells in the eye to respond to light. Without vitamin A you will not be able to see at night. The active form of vitamin A is called retinol. Retinol is found mainly in animal products. If consuming vitamin A-rich foods doesn’t remedy the situation I suggest improving the absorption of it by assisting the liver with the production of bile (absorbs vitamin A).
