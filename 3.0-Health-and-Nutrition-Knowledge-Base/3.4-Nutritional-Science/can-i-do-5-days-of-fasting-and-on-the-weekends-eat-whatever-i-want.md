# Can I do 5 days of fasting and on the weekends eat whatever I want?

Here are two reasons why this is not recommended:

- You are not going to adapt to a full state of ketosis.

- This provides no standard for what to eat.

Recommendation: do intermittent fasting every single day and do it correctly â€“ start with 16:8 daily, then if you are comfortable with the ratio, start shortening the eating window a little bit at a time to notice better results.
