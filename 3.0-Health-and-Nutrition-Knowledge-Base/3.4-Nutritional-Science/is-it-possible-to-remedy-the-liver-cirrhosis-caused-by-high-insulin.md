# Is it possible to remedy the liver cirrhosis caused by high insulin?

If you have high insulin in your body this can cause inflammation and a fatty liver. Inflammation can cause damage to your liver and your body will attempt to heal it, creating scar tissue in your liver. This will result in cirrhosis. Insulin goes too high mainly due to consuming a lot of refined carbs and sugar and due to frequent eating over a long period of time.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid refined carbs and sugar

- Avoid snacking

- Do the Healthy KetoÂ® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

- Do periodic prolonged fasting

- Consume more potassium

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**
