# What are the most important benefits of Vitamin B5?

**Vitamin B5 is essential for the synthesis of:**

• Acetylcholine (good for focus and memory)

• Cortisol

• Epinephrine

• Serotonin

• Melatonin

Vitamin B5 is very important for creating stress hormones, as well as the hormones involved in sleep and your mood. Vitamin B5 can also directly support the cell that controls the circadian rhythm.

Vitamin B5 is needed to make cortisol. Vitamin B5 also helps regulate cortisol, so it’s not too high or too low. You’re not going to be able to sleep if you have high cortisol.

You can take pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) as a supplement. But, there is another version of pantothenic acid called pantethine that may be more powerful. Pantethine is like the active form of pantothenic acid. If you have adrenal problems or sleep problems, you may want to take between 500 and 1,000mg of vitamin B5 to help lower cortisol and promote better sleep.
