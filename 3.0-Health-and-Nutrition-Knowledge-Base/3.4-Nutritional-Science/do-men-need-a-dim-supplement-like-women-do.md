# Do men need a DIM supplement like women do?

DIM is a compound that is concentrated cruciferous. It is 25x stronger than just the vegetable itself. It is a phytonutrient, which can help not just support healthy estrogen levels but healthy testosterone levels too.

DIM inhibits aromatase, which is an enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen. Your fat cells make estrogen so the fatter you are, the more estrogen you may have.
