# Can bile salts and ox bile thin blood?

While ox bile and bile salts are not anticoagulants, they have the potential to indirectly thin blood. While this effect is generally mild at typical supplement-suggested usage, individuals with bleeding disorders, those on anticoagulant medications, and those who are undergoing surgery should exercise caution and consult a healthcare provider before use.
