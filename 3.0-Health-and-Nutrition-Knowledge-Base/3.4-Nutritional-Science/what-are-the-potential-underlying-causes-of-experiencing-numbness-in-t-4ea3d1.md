# What are the potential underlying causes of experiencing numbness in the hands?

Myelin, crucial for nerve function, can be compromised by conditions like diabetes and thiamine deficiency, leading to symptoms such as numbness in hands and feet. Benfotiamine and dietary adjustments may help address thiamine deficiency.

Numbness in hands can also stem from vitamin B12 deficiency, which presents with symptoms like gait imbalance and spinal discomfort. Age-related low stomach acid can hinder B12 absorption, countered by betaine hydrochloride to boost acidity.

Low vitamin B12 may result from dietary insufficiency, antacids, metformin use, genetic factors, or digestive inflammation. Methylcobalamin supplementation, potentially with methylfolate and vitamin B6, is recommended for effective B12 intake and absorption, especially for those with genetic susceptibilities.
