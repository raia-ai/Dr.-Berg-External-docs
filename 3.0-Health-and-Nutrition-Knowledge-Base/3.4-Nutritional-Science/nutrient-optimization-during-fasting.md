# Nutrient Optimization During Fasting

While intermittent fasting can be a powerful tool for improving health, ensuring you're still meeting your body's nutritional needs during your eating windows is crucial.

Keeping an eye on consuming adequate amounts of some often-overlooked heroes – namely magnesium, potassium, and B vitamins– is crucial for staying healthy; they’re fundamental for ensuring everything inside us operates correctly.

Fasting may make your body more prone to nutrient deficiencies, particularly if you don't consume a proper diet during your eating windows.

Consider incorporating nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens, nuts, and seeds into your meals to help prevent deficiencies and support overall health.

Additionally, some people may benefit from supplementing with specific nutrients during their fasting journey.

For example, taking a high-quality magnesium supplement before bed can help support restful sleep and reduce muscle cramps, while consuming citrate-rich foods like lemon juice can help counter keto flu symptoms by promoting hydration and electrolyte balance.
