# Is creatine an effective supplement for weight training?

Creatine is a combination of three amino acids. These are arginine, glycine and methionine. In your muscles, creatine combines with phosphate to help you recycle ATP (the energy currency in the muscles). It helps you to recover energy and assists with muscle development.

**Benefits**

- Can help you tolerate heavy weight training

- Can help with the recovery of the muscle

- Can help with the strength of muscles

- Can help the size of the muscle

**How to consume it**

There are different types of creatine. Some people can actually be allergic to creatine as well. You may want to try a small amount first, to make sure youâ€™re not allergic to it.

There are two versions of creatine that Dr. Berg recommends as better than others:

- Creatine ethyl ester

- Micronized creatine

Follow the manufacturer instructions for the right dosages.

**Where to get it**

You can get it at a health food or nutrition store, or order it online.
