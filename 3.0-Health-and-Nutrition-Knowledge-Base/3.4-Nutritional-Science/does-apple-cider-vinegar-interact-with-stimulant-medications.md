# Does apple cider vinegar interact with stimulant medications?

I've never heard any problems that it will stimulate medication. Maybe you're thinking of grapefruit juice. That could affect medications, but not apple cider vinegar. And there's not any vitamin C in apple cider vinegar either, so you don't have to worry about that.
