# What are some intriguing facts regarding vitamin D, including its physiological roles, sources, and the implications of deficiency on overall health?

Vitamin D is responsible for the 20x increase in calcium absorption in the small intestine. It also increases the absorption of iron, magnesium, zinc, and phosphate to mineralize the bone and support other tissues in the body. However, it has to be activated through an enzyme in the liver and kidney.

Vitamin D is very important in controlling immunity to viruses, especially in the lungs and in autoimmune diseases. Make sure to take vitamin K2 when you take vitamin D because it helps deliver calcium to the bone.
