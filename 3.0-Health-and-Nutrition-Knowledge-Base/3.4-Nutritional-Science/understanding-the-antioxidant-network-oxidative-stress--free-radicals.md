# Understanding the Antioxidant Network: Oxidative Stress & Free Radicals

A free radical is an atom with an unpaired electron and could create a lot of damage inside the body, while an antioxidant is an atom that has a paired electron, is stable and balanced and it also donates one of its electrons to make the free radical stable.

Examples of Free Radicals and Oxidants:

• Iron – In some of the enriched food

• Radiation • Sugar – Large quantities of sugar destroy the body
