# Why do Dr. Berg products include magnesium stearate?

Magnesium stearate is a necessary addition to our supplements to ensure consistent formulation in each of our capsules. Magnesium stearate serves these purposes:

Lubrication: Magnesium stearate helps prevent the various ingredients in our supplements from sticking to the manufacturing equipment, such as capsule-filling machines. This lubricating effect aids in the efficient and consistent production of our supplements.

Flow: It improves the flowability of powdered ingredients, making blending them uniformly without clumping easier and providing consistent ingredients in each capsule.
