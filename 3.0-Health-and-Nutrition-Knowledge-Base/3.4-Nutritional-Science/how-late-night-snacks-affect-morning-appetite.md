# How Late-Night Snacks Affect Morning Appetite?

Eating close to bedtime can disrupt your body's natural circadian rhythms and affect blood sugar levels throughout the night. When you consume food late at night, especially carbohydrate-rich snacks, your body releases insulin to process the glucose.

However, as you sleep, your body's insulin sensitivity decreases, which can lead to higher blood sugar levels.

As the night progresses, your blood sugar levels may drop, triggering a rebound effect in the morning. This can make you wake up hungrier than usual, even if you ate a substantial amount the night before.

To avoid this cycle, it's best to avoid eating large meals or snacks close to bedtime and instead focus on balanced, nutrient-dense foods throughout the day.
