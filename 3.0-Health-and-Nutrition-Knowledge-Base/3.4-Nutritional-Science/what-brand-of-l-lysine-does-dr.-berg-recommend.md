# What brand of L-Lysine does Dr. Berg recommend?

## L-Lysine: A Powerful Amino Acid for Viral Support and Hair Health

While Dr. Berg doesn't have a specific brand recommendation for **L-Lysine**, this essential amino acid is highly beneficial, especially for those managing **herpes (Type 1 or 2)** and **shingles viruses**, and even for **hair health**.

**L-Lysine for Viral Management:**

Herpes and shingles viruses often flare up after significant stress. These viruses rely on another amino acid, **arginine**, to reproduce. L-lysine works by **blocking arginine**, effectively stopping the replication of these viruses and potentially helping to put them into remission.

- **During an outbreak:** For intense conditions, a dosage of **3,000 mg of L-lysine** may be recommended.

- **For prevention:** A much smaller, preventative amount can be taken regularly.

- **Dietary considerations:** To further support your body, focus on consuming foods high in L-lysine while trying to limit foods high in arginine.

**L-Lysine for Hair Growth and Strength:**

Hair is primarily made of protein, which is composed of amino acids. L-lysine is a specific amino acid that can **significantly impact hair growth**, making it stronger and more elastic.

**Tips When Purchasing L-Lysine:**

When you're looking to buy an L-lysine supplement, here are a few tips to consider:

1. **Form:** Look for L-lysine in its free-form, which is easily absorbed by the body.

2. **Purity:** Choose products with minimal fillers and artificial ingredients. Reputable brands will often list their "other ingredients" clearly.

3. **Dosage:** Check the per-serving dosage to ensure it aligns with your needs (e.g., if you're aiming for 1000-3000mg, see how many capsules or tablets that requires).

4. **Certifications:** While not always necessary, third-party certifications can indicate quality and purity.

5. **Reviews:** Look at customer reviews from various sources to gauge product effectiveness and satisfaction.

6. **"L-" prefix:** Ensure it's specifically "L-Lysine" as this is the biologically active form the body uses.
