# How can I address body odor while on Keto?

There are a few things that could cause an odor in your urine or breath, like:

- Liver damage

- Infection

- Dehydration

- Asparagus

- Too much protein

As you transition to keto and intermittent fasting your ketones are going to go up. There
are three types of ketones, but the one that creates the most detectable odor on breath and in urine is acetone. If your urine is darker, cloudy, and has a strong odor chances are itâ€™s going to be acetone (not the nail polish remover; that is different). Your sweat and breath can also have a strong odor as a result.

Your body actually makes acetone as a natural consequence of consuming more fat and less carbohydrate. It is a normal thing and not a concern at all.

To get rid of the odor, increase chlorophyll in your diet. It is a deodorizer that comes from leafy greens. Increase your fluids, and not just by drinking water, but using electrolytes with your water to become more hydrated.

Lastly, as long as you are consistent with your diet, the odor will go away as your body gets adapted to ketosis.

We also recommend trying Dr. Berg's Electrolytes Powder drink. This drink is a perfect keto-friendly beverage! Here is the link: [https://shop.drberg.com/electrolyte-powder-raspberry-lemon-100-servings](https://shop.drberg.com/electrolyte-powder-raspberry-lemon-100-servings)
