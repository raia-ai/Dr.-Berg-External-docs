# What are the advantages of using fermented wheat germ extract?

Fermented wheat germ extract is made by treating wheat kernels with yeast. It is a non-toxic **anti cancer remedy**. This wheat germ extract increases something called apoptosis, which is basically what happens when a cell commits suicide because itâ€™s damaged. This is a good thing because damaged cells that continue to live can cause grave health problems.

Fermented wheat germ extract significantly boosts your chances of survival and decreases the odds of cancer recurring. This is important because cancer can occur over and over again. Wheat germ extract is approved as a medical support for cancer in many European and Asian countries, but not in America (of course).
