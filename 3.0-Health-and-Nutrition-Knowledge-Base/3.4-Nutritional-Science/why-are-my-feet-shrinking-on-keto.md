# Why are my feet shrinking on Keto?

This condition is called fluid retention. Glycogen is the storage of sugar in the body and when you are consuming a lot of carbohydrates, you are running your body out of the stored sugar. Each gram of glycogen is bonded to 2 grams of water. When you are doing a healthy ketogenic diet plan and intermittent fasting, it is very normal that you will dump a lot of the fluid.

• Glucose holds H2O

• Water follows glucose

• Glucose retains sodium

• Glucose rids excessive amounts of potassium
