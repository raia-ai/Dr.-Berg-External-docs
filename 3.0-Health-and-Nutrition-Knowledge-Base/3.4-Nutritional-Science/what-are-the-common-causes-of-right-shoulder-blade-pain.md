# What are the common causes of right shoulder blade pain?

There’s a connection between your liver and your right side shoulder blade. When you get pain in your right shoulder blade, there’s a good chance it could be your liver. Your liver is a huge source of this deferred pain.

The problem can also be the gallbladder or bile duct. This can also irritate the phrenic nerve, which is connected to the neck and shoulders.

**Inflammation and fatty liver are the two main causes of an irritated liver. This is often due to:**

1\. Alcohol

2\. High carb diets

3\. Too much iron

4\. Vegetable oils

5\. Medications

Your diet is by far the biggest factor in liver health. If we compare our diets now to back in the 70s, we can see just how bad things have gotten. Since the 70s, we have increased…

• Grains by 29%

• Corn by 300%

• Vegetable oil by 300%

All of these foods increase inflammation, which can cause liver issues.
