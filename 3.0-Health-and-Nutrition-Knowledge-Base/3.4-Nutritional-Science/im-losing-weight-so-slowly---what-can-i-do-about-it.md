# I'm losing weight so slowly - what can I do about it?

There’s a big difference between not losing any weight and losing weight slowly—and the actions you need to take for each will be entirely different. If you’re not experiencing any weight loss, you have to make a big change.

There’s something affecting your weight loss, and it could be related to your thyroid, adrenals, kidneys, and other parts of your body. To figure out what’s behind this issue, you have to dig deeper and do some testing. If you are experiencing some weight loss, you don’t want to make any huge changes. Instead, you want to strengthen your successful weight loss efforts.

Start by looking at the quality and quantity of your foods. Make sure you’re having moderate amounts of protein, plenty of healthy fats (avoid vegetable oils!), and very low amounts of carbohydrates and sugars (only get your carbs from low-carb vegetables). Avoid snacking. You should only eat 1-3 times a day. Intermittent fasting is a fantastic way to support a healthy body and avoid insulin spikes that block weight loss.

Problems with your sleep, digestion, or mensural cycle may also slow down weight loss. Insulin and Glucose Support is a great supplement for promoting weight loss if you have insulin issues.
