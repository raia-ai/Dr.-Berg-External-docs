# What are the health benefits of alpha-lipoic acid, and how does it affect different bodily functions?

Your body makes alpha lipoic acid, you can get it as a supplement, and it’s in foods like red meat and certain vegetables. When you take alpha lipoic acid as a supplement, you’re getting a lot more of it—like 1000x more than your body can make. 

Alpha lipoic acid is a very powerful antioxidant. If you’re a diabetic, alpha lipoic acid can protect the tissues from that. It can also help with damage within the mitochondria. Alpha lipoic acid acts as a sponge to soak up free-radicals and protect against oxidation. 

Alpha lipoic acid can act as a chelator to help detoxify mercury from the body, which can also produce oxidation. Alpha lipoic acid is also a lipid antioxidant, so it’s good for areas of the body that are lined with lipids (like your nerves).
