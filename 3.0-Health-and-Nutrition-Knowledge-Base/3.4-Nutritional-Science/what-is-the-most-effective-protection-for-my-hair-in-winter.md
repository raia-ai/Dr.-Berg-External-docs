# What is the most effective protection for my hair in winter?

If you have dry, brittle, frizzy, or dull hair during winter, this video is for you. 

**3 reasons why winter causes hair problems:**

1\. A lack of sun exposure can cause a vitamin D deficiency. A vitamin D deficiency can lead to a vitamin B deficiency. 

2\. People consume fewer vegetables rich in phytonutrients and nutrients that are important for hair, including vitamin C, magnesium, and vitamin E. 

3\. People eat more junk food, worsening subclinical deficiencies. 

**Tips to protect your hair during winter:**

• Take vitamin D 

• Eat more vegetables (especially Brussels sprouts, salads, avocados, and bell peppers)

• Take nutritional yeast (for B-vitamins) 

• Consume seafood (for trace minerals and omega-3 fatty acids)
