# What are the most effective interventions for managing and reducing elevated cortisol levels?

Cortisol is a vital hormone—you need small amounts of it to stay healthy. However, when you have way too much cortisol, you can run into many issues when it comes to your health and body weight. Cortisol is a stress hormone that can add pounds to your belly fat.

Here are six ways to help regulate your cortisol levels.

1\. Lower your body stress levels - Stress accumulates in your body. If you don’t release it, it continues to build up and cause issues throughout your body. Acupressure is a great way to get rid of stress in your body.

2\. Increase your sleep - You need to address both the quality and quantity of your sleep. Stress levels, sleep disorders, and insulin resistance can lead to poor sleep.

3\. Increase your aerobic exercise - Aerobic exercise is great for lowering stress and cortisol. Long walks are great for lowering cortisol.

4\. Take vitamins B1, B5, and D - These nutrients are vital for managing health cortisol and stress levels.

5\. Use adaptogens (herbs) - Adaptogenic herbs can help increase your resistance to stress, thus helping support healthy cortisol levels.

6\. Increase potassium and magnesium intake - These nutrients help activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which lowers the fight-or-flight stress response.
