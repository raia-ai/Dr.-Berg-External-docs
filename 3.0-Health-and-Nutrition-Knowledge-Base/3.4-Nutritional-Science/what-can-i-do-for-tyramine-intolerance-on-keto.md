# What can I do for tyramine intolerance on keto?

Addressing tyramine intolerance on a keto diet requires careful dietary management. While a long-term keto lifestyle can improve conditions like autoimmune diseases or insulin resistance, it doesn't mean you can revert to previous eating habits that triggered these issues.

**Genetic Factors and Epigenetics**: Even with genetic predispositions, you have the power to influence your health through lifestyle choices. Epigenetics shows that your actions can modify gene expression, helping you control conditions previously thought to be unchangeable.

**Maintaining Progress**: It's essential to avoid foods that contribute to your intolerances and health issues. Your improved health is sustained by continuing to make smart, health-conscious choices, not by returning to problematic foods.

By adhering to a keto diet and focusing on suitable food choices, you can manage tyramine intolerance effectively and maintain your overall well-being.
