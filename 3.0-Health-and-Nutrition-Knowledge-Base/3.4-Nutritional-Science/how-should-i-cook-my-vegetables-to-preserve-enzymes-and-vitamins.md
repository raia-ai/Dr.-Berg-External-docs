# How should I cook my vegetables to preserve enzymes and vitamins?

**Cooking Methods to Preserve Vegetable Nutrients**

To maintain enzymes and vitamins in vegetables, choose cooking methods that minimize heat and water exposure. **Steaming** is ideal, as it retains most nutrients. **Stir-frying** and **saut√©ing** are also effective due to their short cooking times.

**Boiling** can lead to nutrient loss, especially with water-soluble vitamins. If boiling, use the cooking water in soups or sauces to recover some nutrients.

For optimal nutrient retention, consider steaming, roasting, or stir-frying. These methods help preserve essential vitamins and minerals, including those beneficial for skin health, such as vitamin A in sweet potatoes and carrots.
