# I want to go on a ketogenic diet, but I donâ€™t want to cause kidney stones. What can I do to prevent them?

To prevent kidney stones or gout on the ketogenic plan, consider these tips:

1\. Increase citrates by adding 1 lemon to your water daily. Despite being acidic, lemon turns alkaline in the body, which helps prevent stone formation.

2\. Consume ample vegetables to ensure sufficient nutrient intake.

3\. Stay hydrated by increasing fluid intake, and consider adding 1 tsp of sea salt per day or electrolyte powder to maintain hydration.

4\. Avoid cruciferous vegetables and spinach to reduce oxalate intake. If you do consume foods high in oxalates, pair them with calcium-rich foods in the same meal to bind oxalates and prevent stone formation. Avoid consuming oxalates and calcium separately to prevent stone formation.\]
