# What are the symptoms of COVID 19?

Coronavirus or COVID-19 is a virus that can be spread by contacting an infected person or surfaces that the infected person has touched. It can also spread through droplets of body liquid- -if the infected person sneezes for example. Some people can get exposed to COVID-19 but show no symptoms because their immune systems are effectively countering it. That’s why it’s very important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and diet, so your immune system is bulletproof.
