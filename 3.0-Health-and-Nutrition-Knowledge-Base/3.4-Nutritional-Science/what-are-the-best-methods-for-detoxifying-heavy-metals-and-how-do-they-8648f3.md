# What are the best methods for detoxifying heavy metals, and how do they support toxin removal and overall health?

Unfortunately, our environment is very polluted, and we are bathed in toxins on a daily basis. Heavy metals are one type of these toxins. Today we're going to talk about the best strategy for detoxifying heavy metals.

Heavy metals can accumulate in our tissues and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Heavy metal poisoning can affect different parts of the body, including the heart, digestive system, neurons, red blood cells, and certain proteins. Exposure to heavy metals also creates a lot of free radicals and oxidation and forces our antioxidants to work harder. Heavy metals even block our endogenous antioxidants.

Our bodies have a very powerful detoxification system, but heavy metals block this important system. While you can avoid heavy metals to a certain degree, you really need to strengthen your detox enzymes: glutathione and SOD. These enzymes help break down chemicals and help prevent oxidation and free-radical damage.

**The best foods to support heavy metal detoxification:**

1\. Sulforaphane (broccoli sprouts or broccoli microgreens)

2\. Cilantro

3\. Allicin (garlic)

4\. Curcumin (turmeric)

5\. Cruciferous vegetables

**Two of the best ways to avoid heavy metals:**

1\. Consume organic foods

2\. Get a water filter
