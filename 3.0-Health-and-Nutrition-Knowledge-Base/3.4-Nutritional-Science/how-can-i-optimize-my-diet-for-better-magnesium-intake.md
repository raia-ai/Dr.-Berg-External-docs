# How can I optimize my diet for better magnesium intake?

To ensure adequate magnesium intake, it's best to focus on a diet rich in magnesium-dense whole foods. While supplements can be beneficial, dietary changes should be the first approach.

**Top Dietary Sources of Magnesium:**

Excellent sources include leafy greens like Swiss chard and kale, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains. Avocados, dark chocolate, and fatty fish such as salmon and mackerel also provide substantial magnesium.

When selecting grains, opt for minimally processed varieties like quinoa, buckwheat, and oats, which offer higher magnesium levels than refined grains.

**Improving Magnesium Absorption:**

Be mindful that phytates in grains can inhibit magnesium absorption. Techniques like soaking, sprouting, or fermenting grains can enhance bioavailability. Additionally, while spinach is rich in magnesium, its high oxalate content may hinder absorption. Lower-oxalate greens like Swiss chard and kale are better options for maximizing magnesium intake.
