# Can elevated insulin levels contribute to the development of clogged arteries?

Clogged arteries are created due to certain plaques in the blood routes. This can create a lot of difficulty and stress on your body because it lowers the ability of blood to freely move through its channels.

**Myth about cholesterol**

When it comes to clogged arteries, most people focus on cholesterol. They want to lower their cholesterol by eliminating things like fat, butter, eggs and animal meat. I want to go over some additional data that has to do with the chain reaction that occurs before cholesterol enters your arteries.

Not all cholesterol is bad. In fact, your body makes a ton of it--more than 3,000 mg a day. Keep in mind that an egg only contains 300 mg of cholesterol. If your body makes so much, why is it considered bad? Itâ€™s not. Every cell wall is made from cholesterol. Hormones, specifically sex hormones, are made from cholesterol.

When your artery gets damaged, cholesterol comes as a band-aid for the damage, creating a plaque along with calcium and fibrin (connective tissue). However, we need to fix the underlying issue, which is this: what is creating the damage to your arteries in the first place? Knowing the cause of the damage, you can resolve the plaques and avoid the clogged-artery condition.

**Cause #1: High amounts of insulin**

Frequent eating and a high-carb diet will cause your insulin to be very high. Insulin is a hormone that has the capacity to cause clogged arteries. This is because insulin creates inflammation in the body, which eventually will result in damaged tissue. If this damage occurs in the arteries, your body will try to heal it using a combination of cholesterol, calcium and fibrin (connective tissue) that creates a plaque.
