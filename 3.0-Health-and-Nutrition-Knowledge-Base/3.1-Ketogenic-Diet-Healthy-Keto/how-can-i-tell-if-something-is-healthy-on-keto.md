# How can I tell if something is healthy on Keto?

Not all foods marketed as "keto" are truly healthy. Despite being under 50 grams of net carbs, some contain resistant starches like tapioca and maltodextrin, classified as fiber but impacting insulin differently. These starches are often derived from corn starch and can be misleading on labels.

To ensure you're making healthy choices, read ingredient labels carefully and look for hidden starches and sugars. Stay informed by following reliable sources for up-to-date information on keto-friendly foods.
