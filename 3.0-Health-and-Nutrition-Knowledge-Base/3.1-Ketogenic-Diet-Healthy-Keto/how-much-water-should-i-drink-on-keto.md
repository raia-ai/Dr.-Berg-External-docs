It’s best to drink water only when you are thirsty. Water myths:

- 60% of the body is water – false

- The body doesn’t know when it’s thirsty – false

- Water flushes out fat – false

- Water flushes out toxins – false

- Water helps dry skin – false

The people who drink the most water are actually the most dehydrated because of the difference it makes in their electrolytes, since too much water can flush out the electrolytes you need in your body.

Hyponatremia is a condition where you can get really sick or even die because of drinking too much water.

Dr. Berg says he drinks about 2 to 3 cups of water a day.

Your body adjusts to maintain a natural balance. Just make sure to drink only when you’re thirsty.
