# I'm not hungry on keto but still feeling weak - why is that?

One of the best indicators to know if you’re in ketosis is the hunger goes away. But at the same time, you should not have low energy or fatigue on keto. If you’re feeling weak while on keto, it’s likely related to nutrient deficiencies. 

How to fix low energy or feeling weak on the ketogenic diet:

**Muscle weakness** \- Deficiency of vitamin E or sodium

Consume: Seeds, nuts, leafy greens, or a vitamin E complex supplement for a vitamin E deficiency. For low sodium, consume at least 1 tsp. of sea salt per day. 

**Brain Fog** - Insulin resistance 

Consume: MCT oil, and vitamin D

**Fatigue** \- A vitamin B1, vitamin B5, or potassium deficiency 

Consume: Nutritional yeast, potassium, and magnesium (electrolytes, and vegetables).
