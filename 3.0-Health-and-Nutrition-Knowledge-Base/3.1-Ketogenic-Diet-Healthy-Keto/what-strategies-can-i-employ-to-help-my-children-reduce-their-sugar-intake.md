# What strategies can I employ to help my children reduce their sugar intake?

Added sugars are everywhere, even in places you might not expect them. The average child consumes 66 pounds of added sugar every single year!

**Here are some sugary foods to avoid:**

• Sweetened milk

• Sweetened chocolate milk

• Sweetened tea

• Fruit juices

• Sodas

• Sports drinks

• Vitamin drinks

• Ketchup

• Sauces

• Breaded meats

• Chicken fingers

The best thing you can do for your kid’s health is to get them off of junk food! By removing sugar from the diet, you can get them to start burning fat instead of sugar.

**There are several benefits to burning fat instead of sugar:**

• Improved mood

• Improved cognitive function

• Improved ability to learn

• Stabilized blood sugars

The best way to get your kids to stop eating sugar is to substitute sugary foods with identical alternatives. Keto-friendly cookies, pies, and chocolates are all great alternative foods for kids, without the sugar. Keto bombs are also a great alternative to junk foods and other sugary foods. Keto bombs are similar to a cookie, but made completely of fat. You can use erythritol, xylitol, and stevia to sweeten treats instead of sugar. It may take a few days for your child to adjust, but removing sugar from your kid’s diet is a great choice for their health.
