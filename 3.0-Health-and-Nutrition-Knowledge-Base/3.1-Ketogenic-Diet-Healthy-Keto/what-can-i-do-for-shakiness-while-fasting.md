# What can I do for shakiness while fasting?

Shakiness during fasting often results from rapid adjustments in blood sugar levels. To address this, consider gradually easing into fasting rather than making abrupt changes, particularly if you are new to intermittent fasting or ketogenic diets. Allow your body to adapt at its own pace.

Additionally, ensure your carbohydrate intake remains low when you are not fasting. High carb consumption can prolong the adaptation period and exacerbate low blood sugar symptoms. Maintaining a consistent, low-carb diet will help stabilize blood sugar levels and ease the transition.
