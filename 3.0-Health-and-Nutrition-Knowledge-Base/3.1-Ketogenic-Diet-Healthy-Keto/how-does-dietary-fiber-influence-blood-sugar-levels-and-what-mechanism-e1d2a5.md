# How does dietary fiber influence blood sugar levels, and what mechanisms underlie its role in regulating glucose metabolism?

Fiber plays a crucial role in moderating blood sugar levels by affecting the glycemic load of foods. Foods high in fiber, like carrots, have a low glycemic load because fiber slows the absorption of carbohydrates, preventing rapid spikes in blood sugar. For example, despite carrots having a relatively high glycemic index of 72, their glycemic load is very low at 3 due to their fiber content. In contrast, foods with low fiber, such as potatoes, can have a high glycemic load, with a boiled potato scoring 31. Therefore, incorporating high-fiber foods can help stabilize blood sugar levels by reducing the glycemic load, just be sure to check the glycemic index before consumption.
