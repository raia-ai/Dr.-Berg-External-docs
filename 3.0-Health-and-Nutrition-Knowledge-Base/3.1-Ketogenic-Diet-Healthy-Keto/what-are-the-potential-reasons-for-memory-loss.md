# What are the potential reasons for memory loss?

Symptoms of memory loss have to do with the hippocampus. The hippocampus is an area of the brain that is responsible for short-term, long-term and spatial memory (remembering things that are located somewhere--for example where you parked your car).

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiency**

There are several nutrients that are vital for the healthy functioning of the brain. If you are deficient in those nutrients, the hippocampus is the part of your brain that will be affected most. The good thing is that it can regenerate if you restore your normal levels of the nutrients.

\- Vitamin B1 is a very important vitamin for healthy brain function, as well as for your nervous system.

\- Vitamin D has many health-related functions, including healthy development and upkeep of the brain. Out of all brain areas that are affected by a D deficiency, the hippocampus feels the lack of vitamin D most.

\- If you are deficient in zinc (mineral) your hippocampus won’t work properly, resulting in short- term memory problems.

\- Additionally, If your brain doesn’t have enough oxygen this can result in damage to the hippocampus.

**Remedies:**

- Restore vitamin B1 in your body:

    - take nutritional yeast

    - avoid refined carbs and sugar

    - avoid things and people that stress you out

    - take long walks

- Restore vitamin D in your body:

    - take vitamin D3 (10,000 to 20,000 IU daily)

    - take virgin cod liver oil

- Restore zinc in your body:

    - consume beef liver

    - consume shellfish

    - take a zinc supplement

- Restore oxygen in your body:

    - exercise

    - take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes)

    - hyperbaric oxygen therapy

**Cause #2: High-carb diet**

If you are on a high-carb diet this can result in a brain starvation as blood sugar is not the best source of fuel for your brain, including the hippocampus. There is another type of fuel that your brain loves: ketones (a byproduct of your body burning its own fat). Additionally, intermittent fasting will trigger certain processes that will regenerate your hippocampus.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid refined carbs and sweets

- Avoid snacking

- Take MCT oil (source of ketones)

- Take exogenous ketones supplement

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do intermittent fasting

**Cause #3: High cortisol**

Cortisol is a stress hormone that is being produced by your adrenals (stress-regulating glands). High amounts of cortisol can damage your hippocampus. The solution to that would be to improve your mental and physical stress resistance and recovery.

**Remedies:**

- Consume vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

- Improve sleep (take naps if needed)

- Take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes)

- Avoid things or people that stress you out

- You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support

- You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Other causes:**

- Aging (Healthy Keto + intermittent fasting will help)
