# What is the impact of frequently alternating between being on and off a ketogenic diet?

While engaging in a ketogenic diet, even intermittently, can yield benefits compared to not following any dietary plan, there are notable considerations. Each time you return to a ketogenic regimen, you may find it increasingly challenging to achieve the same results as before. This is often due to the development of insulin resistance, which can complicate the effectiveness of the diet over time. Therefore, consistency in following the ketogenic principles may be crucial for sustained progress.
