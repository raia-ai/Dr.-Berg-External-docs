# Will intermittent fasting help with a lack of good bacteria in the gut?

**This is how to supercharge your gut microbes with intermittent fasting:**

1\. Increase resistance to oxidative stress + xenobiotic stress (exposure to chemicals)

2\. Increase diversity of microbes

3\. Increase tolerance to bad bacteria

4\. Restores intestinal epithelium (lining of the colon)

5\. Microbes live long

6\. Starve off sugar for yeast and candida
