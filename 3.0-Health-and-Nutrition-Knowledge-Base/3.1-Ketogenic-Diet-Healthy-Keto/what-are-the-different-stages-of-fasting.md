# What are the different stages of fasting?

**Dr. Berg Nutritionals does not encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provides this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.**

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast. If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

The six stages of fasting:

Stage 1: 8-14 hours

• Stable blood sugar levels

• Using up stored sugar and sugar in the blood

• At 10 hours—the muscles use about 50% glucose and 50% fat (you’re starting to transition to fat-burning)

Stage 2: 14-24 hours

• Starting to get into ketosis

• Fewer cravings

• More energy

• Improved mood

• Improved cognitive function

Stage 3: 24-36 hours

• Full ketosis and fat burning

• The liver is making ketones

• Decreased appetite

• Decreased ghrelin

• Increased BDNF (new brain cells)

Stage 4: 36-48 hours

• Autophagy

• Kill cancer cells

• Decreased oxidative stress

• Decreased misfolded proteins

• Increased memory

Stage 5: 48-60 hours

• Insulin sensitivity super boost

• More autophagy

• Less inflammation

• Atrophy healing

• Protein sparing

Stage 6: 60-72 hours

• Immune system regeneration

• Spike in immune stem cells

• A 2014 study demonstrated that a 72 hour fast led to a complete rejuvenation of the immune system, and people on chemotherapy had less damage
