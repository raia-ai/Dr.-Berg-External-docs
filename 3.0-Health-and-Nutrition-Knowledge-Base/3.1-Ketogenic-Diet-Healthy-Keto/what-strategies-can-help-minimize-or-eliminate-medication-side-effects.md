# What strategies can help minimize or eliminate medication side effects?

Supporting phase 1 and phase 2 detoxification pathways in the liver is crucial for efficient metabolism of medications and toxins:

1\. **Nutritional Support**: Include cruciferous vegetables, allium vegetables, sulforaphane, or DIM in your diet to enhance detoxification enzymes.

2\. **Intermittent Fasting**: Incorporate fasting to promote detoxification processes.

3\. **Toxin Reduction**: Minimize exposure to toxins to lessen the burden on detox pathways.

4\. **Liver Support**: Opt for a Healthy KetoÂ® diet and consider supplementing with milk thistle to support liver function.

5\. **Herbal Remedies**: Consider incorporating curcumin, green tea, and garlic for their beneficial effects on detoxification.

These strategies can help optimize phase 1 and phase 2 enzyme activity, improving overall detoxification efficiency.
