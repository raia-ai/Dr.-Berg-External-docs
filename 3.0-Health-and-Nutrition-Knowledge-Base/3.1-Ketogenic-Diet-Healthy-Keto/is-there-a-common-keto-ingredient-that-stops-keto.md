# Is there a common Keto ingredient that stops Keto?

Keto is a low-carb diet. Most people know that, on keto, they need to cut out sugar and grains. But, it’s also important to cut out grain oils, or more specifically, seed oils. Many people call grain oils vegetable oils, but they’re really not vegetable oils. They don’t get the oil from vegetables—they get it from the seed of the plant. The problem with grain oil is omega-6 fats. Omega-6 fats are highly inflammatory. They can actually trigger insulin resistance just as much as sugar or refined grains. Grain oils can also get stuck in the body and clog up the liver and brain. Not to mention that many grain oils are GMO.

**Oils and foods higher in omega-6 fats:**

• Soy

• Cottonseed

• Canola

• Corn

• Safflower

• Sunflower

• Almond flour

• Peanut butter

I’m not saying you can’t have some things higher in omega-6 fats like almond flour and peanut butter, but you might want to balance it out by getting omega-3 fats. An average person in America has 15 times more omega-6 than omega-3.

**Top sources (some are keto, some are not)**

1\. Chicken

2\. Grain desserts

3\. Salad dressing

4\. Chips

5\. Nuts/seeds

6\. Pizza

7\. Bread

8\. Fries

9\. Pasta

**The definition of keto is low-carb, and it doesn’t really emphasize the type of fat you should be consuming. I believe healthy keto is the best way to go.**

**Healthier oils:**

• Coconut oil

• Butter

• Olive oil

• Avocado oil

If you’re plateauing on keto, you may be consuming too many grain oils, or you could be using too much almond flour or peanut butter.

**Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids:**

• Fish

• Cod liver oil

• Grass-fed beef and other animal products

• Walnuts

• Chia seed

• Brussels sprouts

**Do not use:**

**• Soy oil**

**• Cottonseed oil**

**• Canola oil**

**• Corn oil**

**Limit:**

• Safflower oil

• Sunflower oil

**Reduce these if you have a problem with inflammation or you’ve hit a plateau:**

• Almond flour

• Peanut butter
