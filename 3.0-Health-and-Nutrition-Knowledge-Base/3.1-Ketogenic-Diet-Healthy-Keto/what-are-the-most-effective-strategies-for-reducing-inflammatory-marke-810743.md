# What are the most effective strategies for reducing inflammatory markers in the body?

The first step I recommend is to eliminate all seed oils from your diet, including canola, soybean, and corn oils. These oils can contribute to inflammation. Additionally, it's important to assess your iron levels, as excessive iron intake can also lead to increased inflammation.

If you are not currently following a ketogenic diet, consider adopting it, as it may help reduce inflammation. Increasing your intake of vitamin D can be particularly beneficial in this regard. Some individuals find that niacin, along with niacinamide, can also aid in reducing inflammation, particularly at the cellular level, and may be worth incorporating into your regimen.
