# The Role of Keto in Stye Prevention

It might come as a shock that what you eat could affect your ocular health, even for styes. Yes, even those pesky styles. A ketogenic diet, focusing on healthy fats and reduced carbohydrates, may be an effective way to improve eye health.

Firstly, it's crucial to understand how this works. A [keto diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/keto-diet-for-beginners) may help regulate insulin levels. Insulin resistance is often linked with immune system impairment, which we know plays a role in stye formation. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2903931) supports this theory.

Besides managing insulin levels, the ketogenic diet also boosts the intake of essential nutrients like vitamins A and D and zinc â€“ all critical for maintaining good eye health.

These micronutrients are essential for properly functioning our mucous membranes, including those in our eyes.

A word of caution, though - while going keto might sound tempting as a potential way to prevent styes, always remember: moderation is key. Overdoing anything isn't beneficial; balance remains paramount regarding nutrition.
