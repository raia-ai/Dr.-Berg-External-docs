# Is tapioca starch ok to consume on Keto?

No. Tapioca is a starch that comes from the cassava plant. It’s actually quite high in carbohydrates. In fact, the carbohydrate content of cassava flour is 25% more than that of white flour.

If we compare tapioca flour to almond flour, this is what we find:

- 1/4 cup tapioca flour – 27 net carbs

- 1/4 cup almond flour – 3 net carbs

There is an ingredient found in many so-called “keto-friendly” products called soluble tapioca fiber. Soluble tapioca fiber is the same thing as “prebiotic tapioca” and “organic non-GMO tapioca fiber.”

Soluble tapioca fiber is a big source of IMO, which is a common sweetener. Dr. Berg no longer recommends it. Recent studies show that IMO has the same glycemic effect as glucose and dextrose. It’s actually worse to use than sugar. If you want to eat keto-friendly foods and stay in ketosis, you may want to stay away from tapioca flour and tapioca fiber.
