# How can I make keto cookies?

Here’s the recipe for some delicious cookies. Chocolate Chip Cookies

**Ingredients:**

1⁄2 cup butter, stored at room temperature
1⁄4 cup sugar substitute (one is Just Like Sugar)
1⁄4 cup brown sugar substitute
1 tsp vanilla
1 egg, plus 1 egg white
21⁄2 cups almond flour
11⁄4 cups sugar-free chocolate chips (King Arthur’s is one brand) 1⁄2 tsp baking soda
1⁄4 tsp salt

**Instructions:**

1\. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

2\. In a medium bowl, mix all wet ingredients and beat until creamy.

3\. In a larger bowl, mix all dry ingredients. Add wet ingredients to dry and mix well into a dough.

4\. Make into balls (you choose the size).

5\. Press slightly using your palm, as these do not spread as they bake. But don’t make them too thin – they have a great consistency when they are about 1⁄2 inch thick.

6\. Bake for about 13 to 15 minutes, till they are slightly brown on top. Do not overbake. If necessary, take out one early and let it cool to check consistency. Ovens cook differently, so go for a shorter time and test. You can always put the cookies back in for a minute to firm them up.

7\. Enjoy!
