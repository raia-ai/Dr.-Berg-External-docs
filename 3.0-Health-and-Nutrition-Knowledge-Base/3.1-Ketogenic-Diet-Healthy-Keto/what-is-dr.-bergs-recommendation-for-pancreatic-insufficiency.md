# What is Dr. Berg's recommendation for pancreatic insufficiency?

Dr. Berg recommends a couple of approaches for managing pancreatic insufficiency:

1. **Dietary Adjustments**: Lowering fat intake is suggested, especially if one is following a ketogenic diet, to help manage the symptoms associated with pancreatic insufficiency.

2. **Enzyme Supplementation**: Dr. Berg suggests using pancreatic enzymes to aid digestion. This can include both prescribed enzymes and over-the-counter options, depending on the individual's specific needs and the severity of their condition.

These recommendations aim to support the pancreas by reducing its workload and enhancing digestion, which can be compromised when the pancreas is not functioning optimally.
