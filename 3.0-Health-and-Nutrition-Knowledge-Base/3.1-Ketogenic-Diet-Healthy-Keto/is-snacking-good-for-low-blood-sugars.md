# Is snacking good for low blood sugars?

Snacking makes low blood sugar worse over time. Every time you eat a snack insulin is triggered, causing your blood sugars to drop again, which makes you want another snack. Snacks will not help improve low blood sugar meaningfully. Instead, try adopting a Healthy KetoÂ® diet, as this will aid your body in regulating blood sugar levels properly.
