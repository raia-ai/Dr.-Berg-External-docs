# What dietary recommendations do you have for a teenager?

For children and teenagers, I recommend a dietary approach similar to that of adults, while ensuring they receive adequate calories and essential nutrients to support proper growth and development. Depending on individual circumstances, I suggest providing three balanced meals per day without snacks. Although intermittent fasting with two meals may be suitable for adults, it is generally not advisable for growing adolescents unless there are specific weight management concerns.

A healthy version of the ketogenic diet, featuring three well-rounded meals, can be particularly beneficial for the health and development of adolescents. If I were a teenager, given my knowledge of nutrition, this would be the approach I would advocate.
