# What do I do if I have hormonal imbalances on Keto?

## **Hormonal Imbalances & Calcium Absorption**

Our bodies are complex systems, with various factors influencing nutrient absorption. Hormonal balance is one such factor. [Hormonal imbalances](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-hormonal-imbalance-really-occurs) can affect the absorption of minerals like calcium, which is crucial for bone health and nerve impulses.

During menopause, hormone levels can vary significantly - particularly a decrease in estrogen - which may lead to decreased mineral uptake, such as calcium.

Postmenopausal women tend to have lower bone density due to reduced calcium absorption, making them more susceptible to osteoporosis.

### **Balancing Hormones For Improved Mineral Absorption**

The good news? Adopting a healthy ketogenic lifestyle may help. The Healthy Keto Diet focuses on consuming nutrient-dense foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals for optimal body function.

- Foods high in healthy fats (like avocados) support hormone production by providing the necessary building blocks for hormones.

- Maintaining stable blood sugar levels through low-carb intake helps prevent insulin spikes, which could disrupt other hormone balances.

- Plenty of leafy greens provide an excellent source of calcium without the risk associated with dairy consumption.
