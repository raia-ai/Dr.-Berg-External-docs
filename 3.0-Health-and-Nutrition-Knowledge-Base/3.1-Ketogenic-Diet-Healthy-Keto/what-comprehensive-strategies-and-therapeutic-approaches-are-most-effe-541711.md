# What comprehensive strategies and therapeutic approaches are most effective in overcoming addictions to alcohol, drugs, or nicotine?

How to stop alcohol, drug or nicotine addictions? - Addiction depletes NAD, a vital coenzyme for energy, DNA repair, and cellular health, leading to symptoms like fatigue and brain fog. Boosting NAD with niacin (vitamin B3) can aid recovery by reducing withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Healthy practices like intermittent fasting, a ketogenic diet, and regular exercise also support NAD production. Consult a healthcare professional before starting supplements or making dietary changes during addiction recovery.
