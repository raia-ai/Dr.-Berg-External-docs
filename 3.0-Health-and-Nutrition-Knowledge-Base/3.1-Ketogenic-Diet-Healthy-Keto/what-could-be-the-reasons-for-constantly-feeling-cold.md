# What could be the reasons for constantly feeling cold?

If youâ€™re following a ketogenic diet and find yourself feeling cold, it may be beneficial to increase your intake of vitamin B1 (thiamine). B1 plays a role in temperature regulation and can help improve your tolerance to extreme temperatures. For example, if you struggle with ice bath therapy due to discomfort, this could indicate a deficiency in B1.

Similarly, if you find yourself overheating easily when exposed to sunlight, it may also suggest a B1 deficiency. Additionally, incorporating iodine from sources like sea kelp could be beneficial. Together, these two nutrients may support better thermal regulation.
