# Can I eat pomegranates on Keto?

In this video, Dr. Berg talks about pomegranate and is it okay to consume on a ketogenic diet. The juice is a bit too high in sugars despite having a moderate glycemic index, however, the seeds are low and they contain phytonutrients (antioxidants) that help your blood sugars and reduce insulin, so yes, on the seeds and NO on the juice.
