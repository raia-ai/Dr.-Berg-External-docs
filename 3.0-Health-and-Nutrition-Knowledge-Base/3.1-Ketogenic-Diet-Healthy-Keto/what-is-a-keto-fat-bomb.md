# What is a keto fat bomb?

A keto fat bomb is a keto dessert that is loaded with healthy fats. It is a great way to stay satisfied between meals if you’re doing the keto diet and intermittent fasting.

Just remember to only have one with your meal, as a keto dessert, and not as a snack between meals.

There is no sugar in these tasty keto-friendly treats – only healthy fats to help get your body move into fat-burning and stay in fat-burning.
