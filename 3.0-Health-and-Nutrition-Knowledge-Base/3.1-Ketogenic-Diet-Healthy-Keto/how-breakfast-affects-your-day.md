# How breakfast affects your day?

What you eat for breakfast affects your ability to focus, your creative ability to solve problems, and how well you sleep at night. A carb-heavy breakfast promotes insulin resistance, which inhibits your ability to absorb fuel. The first place you’ll notice this is in your brain.

Ketones are a much better fuel for your brain than sugar. To make ketones, you need to lower your carbs and sugar. You can also produce ketones by fasting. While fasting, your body must convert to making ketones for energy. Carbohydrate breakfast foods leave you hungry within an hour-and-a-half of eating. Sugary cereal is a poor choice for breakfast. Magic Spoon or keto-friendly granola without added sugar is a better option.

Oatmeal is generally one of the most ultra-processed foods. If you want to eat oatmeal for breakfast, look for regular oatmeal without sugar. The best option for oatmeal is steel-cut oats, although they take longer to cook. Oatmeal and wheat are heavily sprayed with glyphosate, which has been shown to cause cancer and problems with your gut. Choose organic to avoid this problem.

Replacing your breakfast food with protein such as meat, bacon, and eggs can significantly change your energy levels and cognitive function. Eggs and bacon are the perfect healthy morning breakfast. You can also add avocado or cheese. Cheese is very nutritious, a good source of protein, and has good bacteria due to the fermentation process. Yogurt is a great breakfast option. Choose organic Greek or Bulgarian yogurt without added sugar, or make your own yogurt. Instead of giving your kids Wonder bread, try a sprouted bread like Ezekiel bread. Add peanut butter for extra protein. Red meat and pork sausage are also great breakfast foods.

It’s important to prioritize sleep! Losing just one hour of sleep can significantly affect your blood sugar and cognitive state.
