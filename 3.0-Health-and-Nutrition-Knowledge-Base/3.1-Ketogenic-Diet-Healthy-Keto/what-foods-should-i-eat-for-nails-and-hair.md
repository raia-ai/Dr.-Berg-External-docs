# What foods should I eat for nails and hair?

If you want really nice healthy hair, healthy skin, and healthy nails, then you would want to consume healthy fats like avocado and eggs with the yolks. Not use them topically.

Avocados are loaded with carotenoids. Carotenoids are a fat-soluble phytonutrient. Because there is a good amount of fats in avocados, you’re going to absorb these phytonutrients much better. If you combine avocado and eggs, you will have even better absorption. Consuming eggs and avocados on the keto diet, while also doing intermittent fasting, can result in really nice hair, nails, and skin.
