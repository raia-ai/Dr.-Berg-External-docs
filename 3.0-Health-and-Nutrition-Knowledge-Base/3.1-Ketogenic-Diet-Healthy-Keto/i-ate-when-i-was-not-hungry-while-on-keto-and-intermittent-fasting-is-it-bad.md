# I ate when I was not hungry while on Keto and Intermittent fasting, is it bad?

Our body is not designed to eat at the frequency that people eat. You have social events, social events, birthdays, vacations, holidays, going out to dinner, etc.

**One of the best habits you can implement is:**

1\. Only eat when you are hungry

2\. Don't eat unless you are hungry.

If you are doing intermittent fasting and not hungry anymore, then do a gradient approach. The main point is keeping your nutrients high, but just eating less frequently. Eating spikes insulin.
