# Is there a better option for Ozempic?

Visceral fat surrounds the organs and keeps your body in a state of inflammation, preventing fat loss. Avoid these 6 foods that prevent fat loss.

1\. Low-fat yogurt

Low-fat yogurt is typically high in sugar and often contains industrial food starches like modified food starch, modified corn starch, or maltodextrin. Starch is not sweet, so people consume much more than sugar. It’s higher on the glycemic index than sugar and is used to add bulk to a product.

2\. Processed meat

Hot dogs contain industrial sugars such as corn syrup that will spike blood sugar. Adding sugar to meat creates advanced glycated proteins. Organic grass-fed beef hot dogs are a good option!

3\. Atkins products

These products are marketed as low-carb and keto-friendly but contain very low-quality ingredients such as soy protein isolates, seed oils, GMOs, and synthetic fibers. These can cause bloating and diarrhea and also prevent fat loss.

4\. Juice

Many products marketed as “juice” often only contain minimal amounts of fruit juice and have high amounts of sweeteners, such as high-fructose corn syrup. Juice from concentrate is devoid of nutrients. Fructose found in fruit juice can only be broken down by the liver, which can contribute more to a fatty liver than glucose.

5\. Agave nectar

This sweetener seems healthy but is very high in fructose, which is hard on the liver. Coconut sugar and honey are better options but should be avoided when focusing on fat loss.

6\. Mayonnaise

Processed mayo is mainly composed of soy oil. This type of fat is stored in the fat cells and isn’t burned by the body as quickly as saturated fat. Seed oils like soy oil may be at the root of chronic disease.
