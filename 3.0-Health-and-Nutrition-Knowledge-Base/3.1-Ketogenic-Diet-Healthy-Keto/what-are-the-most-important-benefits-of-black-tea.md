# What are the most important benefits of black tea?

Black tea is an oxidized version of green tea that gives a new compound called theaflavin. This is a powerful phytonutrient that gives black tea a red tint.

**Benefits**

It is important to note that you won’t see the following benefits in an unhealthy diet. Theaflavin can’t make up for poor diet choices. However, if you are on a Healthy Keto® diet, black tea can help support your body and promote these health benefits:

- Regulates glucose

- Lowers cholesterol

- Has antiviral properties

- Has antibacterial properties

- Helps prevent cavities

- Helps decrease the risk of osteoporosis

- Helps decrease the risk of metabolic syndrome

- Helps reduce gum disease

- Has anticancer properties

- Supports healthy blood pressure levels

- Lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease

- Lowers the risk of stroke

- Lemon and tea

If you preserve the vitamin C by having your lemon in a cold glass of tea, the vitamin C and citric acid can help you retain a certain phytonutrient in the tea, catechin, by 5x. This phytonutrient is responsible for a number of health benefits.
