# Is MCT Oil good or bad for the liver?

Omega-3 fatty acids are very good for a fatty liver. This includes fish oil and cod liver oil. MCT oils, which are medium-chain triglycerides, are a unique type of fat that can be very good for your liver.

**MCT fats are “burned” or oxidized into energy very quickly. Unlike other oils, MCT oil is water-soluble. Why is this significant? It doesn’t depend on bile or enzymes—you don’t have to break down MCT oil at all.**

MCT oil bypasses your digestive system and is absorbed directly into the body.

**MCT oil is great for:**

• Malabsorption

• Epilepsy

• Supporting a healthy heart

• Those with no gallbladder

Keep in mind that MCT oil doesn’t contain vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids—so you’ll still need to get these in your diet when using MCTs.
