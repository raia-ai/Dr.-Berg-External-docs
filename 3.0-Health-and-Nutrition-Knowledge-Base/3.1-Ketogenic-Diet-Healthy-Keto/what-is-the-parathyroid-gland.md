# What is the Parathyroid Gland?

**Understanding the Parathyroid Glands**

- **Location and Function:** Your body has four parathyroid glands located behind the thyroid in your neck. These glands are crucial for regulating calcium levels in your blood, ensuring a healthy balance.

- **Consequences of Imbalance:** Too much or too little calcium can lead to health problems. Parathyroid malfunctions can cause your body to withdraw excessive calcium from your bones, potentially leading to osteopenia, osteoporosis, fractures, bone pain, and hypercalcemia (excess blood calcium). Hypercalcemia may cause high blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, kidney stones, fatigue, memory issues, and GERD.

- **Hypocalcemia:** Parathyroid problems can also result in hypocalcemia (low blood calcium).

- **Potential Causes of Tumors:** Exposure to toxins like aluminum, ozone, and certain pesticides may increase the risk of parathyroid tumors.

- **Supporting Parathyroid Health:** A diet rich in cruciferous vegetables, choosing organic foods, and following a healthy keto diet may support parathyroid function.
