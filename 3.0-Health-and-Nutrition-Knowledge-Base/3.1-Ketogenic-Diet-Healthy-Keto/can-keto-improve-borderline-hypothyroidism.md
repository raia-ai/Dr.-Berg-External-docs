# Can keto improve borderline hypothyroidism?

Adopting a ketogenic diet can significantly benefit your thyroid and overall endocrine system. High-carb diets increase insulin levels, leading to insulin resistance, which can severely impact the thyroid and other endocrine functions. Some people believe they can't follow a keto diet due to conditions like diabetes or Hashimoto's, but these are actually reasons to consider it. Keto can reduce inflammation, which is particularly beneficial for autoimmune thyroid disorders. Therefore, implementing a ketogenic diet may improve your situation.
