# What are the underlying causes of air hunger?

When traditional causes like asthma, pneumonia, COPD, or heart conditions are ruled out, persistent difficulty breathing (pseudo-dyspnea) may persist. Here are some natural remedies for specific underlying causes:

1\. **Silent reflux**: Consider chlorophyll, wheatgrass juice powder, betaine hydrochloride (if tolerated), and diluted apple cider vinegar consumed through a straw (if no gut or esophageal irritation).

2\. **Alkalosis**: Address with betaine hydrochloride (if tolerated), diluted apple cider vinegar, Healthy KetoÂ® diet, intermittent fasting, and TUDCA supplementation.

3\. **Costochondritis**: Try massaging and stretching the spine, and using a mobility stick for relief.

4\. **COVID**: Consider thiamine (vitamin B1) for potential respiratory support.

These natural approaches aim to alleviate symptoms and address underlying causes of pseudo-dyspnea effectively.
