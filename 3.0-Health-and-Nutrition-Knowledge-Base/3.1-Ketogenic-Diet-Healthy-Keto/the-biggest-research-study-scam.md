# The Biggest Research Study Scam

**Understanding Research Manipulation and the Importance of Critical Evaluation**

Dr. Westman, an M.D. and Master's-level statistician, highlights how data in research studies can be manipulated to present misleading information. He emphasizes the crucial distinction between absolute risk and relative risk and how this difference can be exploited.

**The Limitations of Observational Studies**

Dr. Westman points out that observational studies often cannot prove causation. He cites examples like recent headlines demonizing red meat and fasting, which frequently stem from self-reported observational studies with unreliable dietary recall data.

While observational studies cannot establish definitive cause-and-effect relationships, they serve a purpose as "hypothesis-generating studies," providing a potential starting point for more rigorous experimental research.

**Case Study: The Stanford Twin Experiment**

Dr. Westman discusses the Stanford twin experiment, a study with flaws and funding from a plant-based interest group, as a recent example of potentially misleading research.

**Nutritional Epidemiology and its Weaknesses**

Harvard University's School of Public Health conducts research based on observational studies linking dietary elements to health outcomes. Dr. Westman cautions that nutritional epidemiology often only reveals weak associations and shouldn't be treated as definitive fact.

**Dr. Westman's Approach**

Dr. Westman's clinic uses a low-carb keto diet to successfully treat numerous chronic health conditions, including diabetes, obesity, heartburn, and IBS. He focuses on both treating and educating patients, offering online courses on health topics through his Adapt Your Life Academy.
