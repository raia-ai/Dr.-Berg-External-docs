# What steps can an individual take following an ischemic stroke for recovery and rehabilitation?

After an ischemic stroke, consider these approaches:

1\. **Ketogenic Diet**: Adopt a healthy ketogenic diet and practice intermittent fasting to support brain health and metabolic function.

2\. **Tocotrienols**: Supplement with tocotrienols to improve circulation in the vascular system, aiding brain and arterial health.

3\. **Methylene Blue**: Take 40 drops daily in water with electrolytes to support mitochondrial function and oxygenation of brain cells, promoting cell repair after stroke.

4\. **Garlic**: Incorporate garlic for its anti-thrombotic properties, which can help prevent blood clots.

These interventions aim to support recovery and reduce the risk of further complications post-stroke.
