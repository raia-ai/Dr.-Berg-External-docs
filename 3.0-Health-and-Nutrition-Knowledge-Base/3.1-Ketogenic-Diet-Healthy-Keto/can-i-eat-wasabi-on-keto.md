# Can I eat wasabi on keto?

Yes. Wasabi has various phytonutrients that, when combined either by grating, shredding, or crushing the plant, stimulate a very special phytonutrient in the plant called isocyanates, which is responsible for the pungent taste of mustard, radish, horseradish, and wasabi. This phytonutrient is 3,000 times more concentrated in wasabi than cabbage and may have anticancer effects.

Potential health benefits of wasabi:

• May have anti-cancer effects

• Has potent antimicrobial properties

• Can support the cardiovascular system

• Can support the respiratory system

• Has anti-inflammatory effects

• A powerful antioxidant

• Can help thin mucus

You should know that true wasabi is very hard to grow and is very expensive. Most wasabi available is fake. 95% of the wasabi sold at sushi restaurants is made from other ingredients – not wasabi. They use either green food coloring or spinach juice to give it the green color.
