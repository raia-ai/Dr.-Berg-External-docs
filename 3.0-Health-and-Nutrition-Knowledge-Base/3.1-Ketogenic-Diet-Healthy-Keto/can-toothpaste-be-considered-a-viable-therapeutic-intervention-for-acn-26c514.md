# Can toothpaste be considered a viable therapeutic intervention for acne management?

Toothpaste is formulated for your teeth, not your skin. There are actually several ingredients in toothpaste that are not good for your skin.

**A few of these ingredients are:**

1\. Sodium bicarbonate This is very alkaline and can irritate your skin. It can also disrupt the natural bacteria of your skin.

2\. Sodium lauryl sulfate This can be too harsh on the skin. It can remove the oil layer and can cause irritation or even a rash.

3\. Triclosan This may make your bacteria resistant to antibiotics.

4\. Fluoride This could create a condition called fluoroderma, which actually looks like acne. If you want nice skin, don’t put toothpaste on it.

**Instead, try these four things:**

• Lower your carbs (get on the healthy keto diet)

• Do intermittent fasting

• Take probiotics

• Avoid dairy
