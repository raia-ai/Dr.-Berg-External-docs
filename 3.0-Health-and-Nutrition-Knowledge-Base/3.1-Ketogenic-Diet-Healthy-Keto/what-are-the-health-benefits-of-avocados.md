# What are the health benefits of avocados?

**Avocado: A Nutritional Powerhouse**

Avocados pack a serious nutritional punch. Here's what you get in an average avocado:

- **Potassium Power:** 500-800 mg of potassium for energy, healthy blood sugar, and a happy heart. It's also a natural relaxant, potentially aiding sleep and blood pressure.

- **Essential Vitamins:** Folate, vitamin C, vitamin K, B vitamins, vitamin E, and more!

- **Fat-Soluble Boost:** Avocados are rich in fat-soluble vitamins, which help your body absorb other nutrients.

**Keto-Friendly Goodness**

- **Low Net Carbs:** Just 2g net carbs per cup fit within a keto diet.

- **Healthy Fats:** About 77% of an avocado is fat, primarily the heart-healthy monounsaturated kind.

**Fiber-Rich for Gut Health**

- **Insoluble Fiber:** Avocados are 75% insoluble fiber, speeding up digestion (but go easy, too much can cause issues!). This fiber is also a feast for those beneficial gut bacteria.

**Plant Power: Phytonutrients**

- **Anti-Everything:** Enjoy anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antimicrobial benefits.

- **Blood Sugar Support:** Certain phytonutrients may help manage blood sugar levels.

- **Types:** Avocados boast fat-soluble carotenoids and phytosterols.
