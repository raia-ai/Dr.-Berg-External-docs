# What is fat adaptation?

If you aren’t familiar with keto already, the goal is to go from burning sugar (glucose) for fuel to burning fat (ketones) for fuel.

Fat adaptation is a transition from sugar-burning into ketosis (the body burns fat for energy, and if you are doing keto to achieve weight loss, the body burns its own fat).

When you first start keto, here’s what to expect:

- Around 3 days in, you begin burning ketones (instead of glucose)

- At around 1 to 2 weeks, you lose a lot of water weight

- At around 3 weeks, weight loss may slow down temporarily

- At around 4 to 12 weeks, most people become fully fat-adapted (weight loss increases)

- At around 12 months, athletes become fully fat-adapted
