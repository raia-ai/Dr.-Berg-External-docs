# How can I visualize my plate instead of counting macros?

The three macronutrients are proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Most foods are not 100% one macro—they often contain multiple macros.

Let’s start breaking down your meal plate.

**You want the majority of your carbohydrates to come from vegetables.** The average person needs at least 7 cups/servings of vegetables every day. One cup of vegetables is roughly a fist full of salad. If you’re consuming more dense vegetables—broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers, carrots—then you only need about 3.5 cups/servings per day. You can also include a small number of berries in your diet, which count as carbohydrates.

**Olives, hummus, and avocados are a combination of carbohydrates and fats**. Fats and proteins are often combined. The fattiest proteins are the best to consume on a healthy keto diet. Avoid all low-fat proteins and do not trim the fat off of full-fat meats.

**3-5 oz of protein per meal is ideal.** For men, this is 1-2 pieces of protein that are about the size of the palm of your hand. For women, about 1 palm worth of protein. This would be similar to 2-4 eggs, one handful of nuts, 2 thumb-sized pieces of cheese, or 1-2 thumb-sized servings of nut butter.
