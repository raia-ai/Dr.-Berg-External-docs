# What's the best meal to clean arteries and keep them plaque-free?

The endothelial layer is the innermost layer of your arteries. It controls blood pressure, acts as a filter, prevents clots, and supports immune function. The inside of your arteries is very susceptible to problems with insulin. Most people have insulin resistance, which is caused by chronic carbohydrate consumption and constant snacking.

Nitric oxide relaxes the blood vessels and is vital for the health of the endothelial layer of the arteries. Vitamin D triggers nitric oxide, which is why many people who are low in vitamin D also have high blood pressure. Arginine, testosterone, and magnesium also trigger nitric oxide.

Vitamin D and magnesium can help prevent calcium from building up in the arteries, and vitamin K2 also helps to prevent calcium buildup.

Foods like whole grains and seed oils are deemed “heart healthy,” but they spike insulin. We’re also told to avoid saturated fats because of the cholesterol content. There’s a lot of false information regarding a diet that’s truly healthy for your heart.

The best meal to clean your arteries would involve foods that don’t spike insulin. A low-carb ketogenic diet is best for your heart. The primary part of the best meal to clean out your arteries should be grass-fed red meat. If you’re having a burger, melt raw cheese on top because it’s high in vitamin K2. Red meat is loaded with zinc, which can directly improve your testosterone. Include a salad with your meal. Arugula is a great addition to any salad, as it can increase nitric oxide and is rich in vitamins C and E. Pumpkin seeds are also beneficial due to their high magnesium, zinc, and selenium content. Vitamin D3 is vital for a healthy heart. Sunlight is the best source, but you may need to take a supplement in the winter. Take at least 10,000 IU daily as a maintenance dose.
