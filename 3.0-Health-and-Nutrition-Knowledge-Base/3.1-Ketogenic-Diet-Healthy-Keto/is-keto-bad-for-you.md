# Is keto bad for you?

Keto isn't inherently bad; it simply means fat burning. However, the quality of your food choices matters. Healthy KetoÂ® emphasizes high-quality, nutrient-rich foods, while regular keto may overlook this aspect. Ketoacidosis, a dangerous condition, is rare and typically only occurs in specific circumstances like uncontrolled type 1 diabetes. In Healthy Keto, fat burning occurs without risking ketoacidosis, making it a safe and beneficial approach.
