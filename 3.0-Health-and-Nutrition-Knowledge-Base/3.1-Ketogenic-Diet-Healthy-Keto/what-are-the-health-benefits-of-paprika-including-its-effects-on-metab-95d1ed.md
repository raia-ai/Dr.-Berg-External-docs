# What are the health benefits of paprika, including its effects on metabolism, inflammation, and overall nutrition?

Paprika is made from dried and ground red peppers. Hungary is a major source of paprika. The spice became popular in the 19th century. When we talk about the health benefits of spices, we’re primarily talking about the phytonutrients in the spice. These phytonutrients are often related to the color of the pigments in it.

In paprika, there are various colors—yellow, orange and red. The yellow and orange pigments are alpha-carotene and beta-carotene.

Zeaxanthin, lutein, and B-cryptoxanthin are also yellow and orange pigments contained in paprika. These are great for your eyes. Red pigments include capsanthin and capsorubin. Together, these phytonutrients create some amazing health benefits. Take a look:
