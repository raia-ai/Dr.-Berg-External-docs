# What strategies can be employed to effectively manage elevated bilirubin levels in the body?

To address high levels of bilirubin, consider incorporating a comprehensive approach:

Firstly, a gallbladder formula containing bile salts can aid in improving bile flow, which helps in the breakdown of bilirubin. Additionally, supplementing with milk thistle can support liver health and enhance its ability to metabolize bilirubin effectively.

Adopting a healthy ketogenic diet may also benefit liver function by reducing inflammation and supporting metabolic processes. This dietary approach can provide essential nutrients while minimizing stress on the liver.

Consulting with a healthcare provider is advisable to ensure personalized guidance and monitoring as you address elevated bilirubin levels.
