# Is SlimFast safe to consume on Keto?

The first problem with these products is the ingredient list. The ingredients include:

- Maltodextrin (110 on the glycemic index–sugar is only 70!)

- Dextrose (Synthetic sugar with the glycemic index of 100)

- Tapioca

- Soy (GMO)

- Canola oil (GMO)

- Synthetic vitamins (poorly absorbed)

- Caffeine

- Beet sugar (GMO)

These are poor-quality ingredients, which should have no place in a ketogenic diet.

A second problem with these products is that they are snack-based–meaning they are meant to be eaten as snacks or treats, like chips, bars and energy boosters. This isn’t compatible with intermittent fasting. Consistent blood sugar spikes will halt weight loss.

A final problem with SlimFast is their integrity. They are still producing the original SlimFast, which has 18 grams of sugar (beet sugar). We have a massive epidemic right now of people consuming too much sugar. Promoting more sugar consumption is not okay for a company that is supposed to be helping people improve their health.

Overall, it seems that SlimFast is just trying to tap into a trending market to make a big profit.
