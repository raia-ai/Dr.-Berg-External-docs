# Does stress affect my weight loss on keto?

Stress may actually prevent ketosis. When you spike cortisol, which is a stress hormone, you could start to break down your protein and turn it into glucose.

Basically, when you have a lot of stress, your blood sugars rise, which will cause insulin to spike to lower the elevated blood sugar.

Over time, this could create insulin resistance, which could lead to diabetes. Synthetic cortisol, like prednisone, may have the same effect.

**What may help:**
