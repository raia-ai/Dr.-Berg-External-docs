# What to do for Alzheimer's Disease if nothing is working?

Interestingly, smoking cigarettes and ibuprofen reduce LH and Alzheimer's risk. Now, I'm definitely not saying you should start taking ibuprofen and smoking cigarettes to prevent AD.

The drug Lupron—which is used for endometriosis, fibroids, prostate cancer, and breast cancer—also decreases the risk of Alzheimer's. Lupron also happens to lower LH. However, Lupron has numerous adverse side effects.

There is one drug without side effects that can also decrease LH: melatonin. Melatonin is stimulated by darkness, and it helps you get into a deep sleep. It also helps stimulate your immune system and offers powerful antioxidant properties.

Melatonin has significant effects when it comes to reducing Alzheimer's risk in women. Men can also see some benefits when taking much larger amounts of melatonin.

Here is what the book recommends for reducing Alzheimer's risk.

- Females: 75mg of melatonin per day

- Males: 120 mg of melatonin per day

- 300mg pregnenolone

- 3tsp MCT oil

- Regular exercise

- Fasting

Always check with your doctor before applying any of this information. This is just to educate you on these interesting links between hormones and Alzheimer's disease.
