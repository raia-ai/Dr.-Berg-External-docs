# How can I remove skin tags and warts overnight?

High insulin can increase one's susceptibility to skin tags. People with diabetes, overweight people, and women with PCOS are at a higher risk of developing them. When you produce too much insulin over a period of time, you can develop insulin resistance. Too much insulin is caused by eating too many carbs or frequent eating. Insulin resistance makes it difficult to absorb glucose. Over time, this deprives your brain cells of fuel, leading to memory problems, concentration problems, and early dementia.

**The solution** is to give your body an alternative fuel source, such as ketones, fatty acids, and protein. To do this, lower your carbs and do intermittent fasting. This will lower insulin and prevent growths like skin tags and warts.

A virus that comes out of remission can create warts if your immune system is compromised. Sufficient vitamin D can support the immune system and put these viruses back in remission. Take 10,000 IU of vitamin D daily, especially in winter.

**Povidone iodine** is an excellent remedy for skin tags. It has potent antiviral and antimicrobial properties, so it’s also good for warts. Iodine dissolves the protein in the skin tag and acts as a dehydrator.

**Garlic** contains allicin, a powerful antiviral compound effective against warts. Because it’s often difficult to differentiate between warts and skin tags, add garlic to ensure your remedy is effective.

**Crush one clove of garlic** and combine one drop of garlic with one drop of iodine. Apply the mixture to your wart or skin tag and cover it with a band-aid. Repeat this every day until your skin tag or wart is gone.
