# How can I increase fat intake on keto?

To ensure sufficient fat intake on keto and intermittent fasting:

1\. Incorporate healthy fats into your diet, such as:

\- Avocado

\- Olive oil

\- Coconut oil

\- Nuts and seeds

\- Fatty fish

2\. Listen to your hunger cues rather than focusing solely on reaching a specific fat percentage. Eat until satisfied, adjusting fat intake accordingly.

3\. Allow your body to utilize its own fat stores for energy by gradually reducing fat intake as weight loss progresses.

4\. During maintenance phases, increase dietary fat to maintain weight, but adjust intake as needed to align with energy requirements.
