# What should I do if I can’t make my kids eat healthy foods?

If your child only eats junk food, here’s what you need to know:

1\. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Picky eating often results from deficiencies in nutrients like zinc, DHA, and vitamin B1. These can affect taste, mood, and behavior.

2\. **Common Culprits**: Foods like sugary cereals, french fries, and packaged snacks often contain MSG and refined carbs, which can worsen these deficiencies and increase appetite.

3\. **Healthy Alternatives**: Switch to Healthy Keto® foods. Instead of banning junk food, find healthy substitutes and involve your child in cooking.

4\. **Supplements**: Consider supplements to address nutrient deficiencies and make the transition to healthy eating easier.
