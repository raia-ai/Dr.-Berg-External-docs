# Is cantaloupe juice beneficial?

While cantaloupe juice contains valuable nutrients, its high sugar content, especially when juiced, poses concerns. Juicing removes the fiber that helps regulate sugar absorption, leading to a direct intake of fructose, which may not be ideal, particularly for those managing blood sugar levels. I’ve learned from personal experience—once juicing large amounts of carrot juice until noticing a skin color change—that moderation is key. Cleanses involving sugary juices or glucose can prevent full adaptation to ketosis, making fasting more challenging and intensifying cravings. For effective cleansing and fasting, it's crucial to consider the impact of sugar and opt for methods that support metabolic balance.
