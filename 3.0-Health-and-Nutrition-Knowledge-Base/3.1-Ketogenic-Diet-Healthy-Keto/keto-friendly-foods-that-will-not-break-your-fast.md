# Keto Friendly Foods that Will Not Break Your Fast

The ideal fasting process is by only consuming water but the important part is keeping the insulin levels low so if you consume something that would keep the insulin low, it is not going to interfere with the benefits of fasting.

**Things that will NOT affect insulin:**

1\. Fiber (green salad)

2\. Fat (MCT Oil, Butter, Coconut Oil, Whole Cream)

3\. Tea / Coffee

4\. Supplements

5\. Green Powder
