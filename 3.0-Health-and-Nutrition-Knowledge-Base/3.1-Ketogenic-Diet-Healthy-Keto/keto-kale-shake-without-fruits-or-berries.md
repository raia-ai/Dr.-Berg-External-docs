# Keto Kale Shake without Fruits or Berries

I want to tell you about making kale shakes without berries or fruit since some people don’t want the carbohydrates those items contain. First, blend the kale. I use the organic frozen kale from Trader Joe’s, and fill the blender about two-thirds full with the frozen kale.

Next, I add water to the same level as the kale, then blend for four minutes. Make sure you use a high-powered blender, or else the kale doesn’t come out smooth. The reason I blend the kale first is that otherwise, it foams up too high if you put in other ingredients before blending it.

Then add the rest of the ingredients, blending briefly after you add each one: one to three teaspoons of lemon juice, which helps prevent kidney stones and calcium deposits. One scoop of raw wheatgrass juice powder, lemon-flavored, which contains stevia and adds some sweetness without the carbs. One teaspoon of electrolyte powder, to get the benefit of its trace minerals and extra potassium.

Be sure to blend only briefly! If you do it too long, the shake will foam and overflow the blender. If you want to consume this shake as a meal, add one teaspoon of coconut oil. You can add more if you want. This gives you some seriously good fat. I love 100 percent organic, virgin, cold-pressed, and unrefined coconut oil.

There aren’t many carbs in the kale and low in protein. This is a very low-glycemic drink. If you’re on a two-meal per day schedule, you can drink this shake during your eating window, or in the morning when you wake up. What I do is drink half of it with a meal, wait an hour, then drink the rest. I store the shake in mason jars.

This shake is sometimes my entire salad for the day! It doesn’t really matter exactly when you drink it, it’s a matter of how much you can consume with a meal without feeling stuffed. If you need to, break it up into portions and consume a little at a time.
