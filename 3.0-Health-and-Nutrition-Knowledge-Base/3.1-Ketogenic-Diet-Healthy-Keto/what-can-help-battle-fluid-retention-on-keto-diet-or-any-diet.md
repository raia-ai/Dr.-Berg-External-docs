# What can help battle fluid retention on Keto diet or any diet?

Let's discuss water retention and weight gain in the context of the ketogenic diet.

Water retention, characterized by an excessive buildup of fluid in the circulatory system, can be influenced by various factors in the ketogenic diet. It's important to note that the weight gain observed is typically related to water rather than actual fat.

Let's discuss water retention and weight gain in the context of the ketogenic diet. Water retention, characterized by an excessive buildup of fluid in the circulatory system, can be influenced by various factors in the ketogenic diet. It's important to note that the weight gain observed is typically related to water rather than actual fat. Causes of Water Retention:

1\. Low Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): A deficiency in Vitamin B1 can lead to fluid retention and ankle edema. Adding nutritional yeast to your diet can help address this deficiency.

2\. Low Potassium: Inadequate vegetable consumption can result in low potassium levels. However, if you're still experiencing fluid retention despite consuming many vegetables, it could be due to an inability to digest excessive fiber. Leafy greens are an excellent source of potassium.

3\. Fiber: Both soluble and insoluble fiber can contribute to fluid retention. Fiber demands fluid to bulk up and facilitate the passage of stool through the digestive system.

4\. High Salt Intake: Excessive salt consumption can contribute to water retention.

5\. High Carbohydrate Intake: Consuming too many carbs is associated with fluid retention because carbohydrates have the ability to retain fluid.

It's crucial to understand that on the ketogenic diet, any observed weight gain is predominantly water weight, not fat. Adjusting your diet to address specific nutrient deficiencies and moderating fiber intake can help manage water retention and promote a healthier balance.
