# Can eating salad contribute to weight gain?

Hidden carbs from croutons, dried fruit, or salad dressings can cause weight gain, but if you're following keto and intermittent fasting, they are likely not the issue.

Increased salad intake may lead to digestive issues if your body lacks the necessary microbes and enzymes. Vegetables contain two types of fiber: soluble (retains water) and insoluble (does not). Inadequate fiber breakdown can slow digestion and cause water retention, leading to weight gain.

To prevent this, try:

1\. Steaming vegetables to break down fiber.

2\. Choosing easier-to-digest vegetables like squash, cauliflower, broccoli, and asparagus.

3\. Gradually increasing vegetable intake to build up gut microflora.

This approach helps reduce bloating and water retention while your body adjusts to digesting fiber efficiently.
