# Have you seen any data that indicates intermittent fasting increases the risk of gut and liver cancer?

There is no evidence to suggest that intermittent fasting increases the risk of gut or liver cancer. In fact, throughout human evolution, periods of fasting were common, and our genes are well-adapted to this pattern. Intermittent fasting can help regulate insulin levels, unlike frequent eating, which can lead to constant insulin spikes. Humans, like animals in the wild, are not designed to graze continuously but to eat when genuinely hungry.
