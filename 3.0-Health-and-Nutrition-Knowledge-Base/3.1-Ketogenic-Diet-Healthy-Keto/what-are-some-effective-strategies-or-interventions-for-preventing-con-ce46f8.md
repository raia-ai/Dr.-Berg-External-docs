# What are some effective strategies or interventions for preventing constipation and promoting optimal digestive health?

Incorporate these strategies to optimize your gut health for the long term:

- Listen to your body. Ignoring your bodyâ€™s signals is like silencing a smoke alarm.

- Find what works for YOU. It often takes some trial and error to discover the specific combination of strategies that brings you relief.

- Embrace a well-formulated ketogenic diet. A healthy keto diet emphasizing whole foods like lean meats, healthy fats, and low-carb veggies can be remarkably transformative.

- Stay adequately hydrated with electrolytes. This goes beyond just plain water. Those minerals are key.
