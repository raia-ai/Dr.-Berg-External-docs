# What are the most effective strategies for stress management?

1\. Increase your sleep - If you aren’t getting enough sleep at night, you’re not going to be able to be patient and stress-free throughout the day. Avoid blue light before bed and get 7-8 hours of quality sleep.

2\. Get plenty of vitamin B1 - Vitamin B1 directly affects your tolerance to stress. Get vitamin B1 from a natural source, like nutritional yeast.

3\. Lower your carbohydrates - A high-carb diet will cause significant blood sugar and insulin fluctuations, which can cause significant irritability and boost your stress.

4\. Avoid the news - The news can be overwhelmingly negative, and it can add unnecessary fear and stress to your life.

5\. Exercise - Exercise increases the oxygen in your blood and lowers your stress naturally. Long walks are especially good for lowering your stress levels.

6\. Magnesium - This mineral is great for lowering your stress levels. 7 cups of vegetables and a bottle of mineral water a day will give you plenty of magnesium.

7\. Vitamin D - Get plenty of sunlight or supplement vitamin D. Vitamin D helps reduce stress and anxiety as well as support healthy sleep.

8\. Ketones - Ketones elevate your mood and promote healthy stress levels. Get on keto and intermittent fasting.

9\. Change your environment - Get outside and enjoy nature. This can really help slow down your pace and get rid of stress.
