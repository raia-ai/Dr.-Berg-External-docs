# Can I eat bananas on keto?

No, due to high sugar and fat content.

Many people think that bananas are the best source of potassium. Although bananas do have some potassium, you would have to consume 12 bananas, on average, to get the amount of potassium that your body needs on a daily basis.

We need about 4700 mg of potassium each day and bananas only have between 300 and 400 mg. To put this amount of potassium in perspective, that would be 7 to 10 cups of salad per day.
