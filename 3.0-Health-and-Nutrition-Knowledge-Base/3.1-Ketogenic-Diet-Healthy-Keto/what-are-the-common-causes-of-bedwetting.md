# What are the common causes of bedwetting?

Bedwetting is a common problem in children, but many adults can have accidents or near accidents too. Getting up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night has the same root cause as bedwetting.

**Cause #1: High insulin**

Bedwetting is caused by high levels of insulin. And that results from a high-carb diet. Carbohydrates spike your insulin levels. Over time, this causes the cells to develop a resistance to insulin--which then causes higher insulin production by your body. As you know, Insulin lowers blood sugar. When the blood sugar goes down your body lets go of excess liquid. This can happen at night.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid sugar and refined carbs

- Avoid grains

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

- Do a Healthy Keto® diet

- Consume vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)

- Consume vegetable shakes

**Get plenty of insulin-regulating nutrients**

• chromium
• potassium
• B vitamins (nutritional yeast)
