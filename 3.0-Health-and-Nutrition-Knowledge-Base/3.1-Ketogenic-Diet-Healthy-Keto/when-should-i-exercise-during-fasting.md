# When should I exercise during fasting?

Typically a big mistake people make is adding too many things like keto, intermittent fasting, and exercise too fast. Maybe they’re trying to go to two meals a day right away and are exercising on top of that. This could be too much too soon.

A good indicator to know if you’re ready for exercise is how you feel when you start to exercise.

You may not want to do things like cardio or interval training early in the morning if you’re fasting. You could deplete your glycogen reserve, and if you’re not adapted, you’re going to get really hungry. You may want to exercise just before your meal, in-between your first and second meal, or just after your last meal. Some people may benefit from adding more protein to their diet when they workout.

Some people may also need to add a meal when they work out if they are too hungry and haven’t fully adapted yet. Another thing that may help is creatine. Creatine could potentially help improve recovery and increase muscle mass. Creatine doesn’t have to be taken with a meal.
