# What are the most reliable predictors of a heart attack?

Calcium and cholesterol act as band-aids to help repair the artery. But this is late on the chain of events after inflammation and after high insulin. High insulin starts this chain of events in place with the eventual hardening of your arteries, high blood pressure, and plaquing.

The coronary artery feeds the heart muscle blood and if this muscle does not get its oxygen, then it cramps and you get a heart attack. A simple test (CAC) costing under $100 and taking 2 seconds, can give you valuable feedback on your past lifestyle and score things for you. Reducing insulin with healthy ketosis and intermittent fasting is the first action to start with since high insulin triggered this problem in the first place.
