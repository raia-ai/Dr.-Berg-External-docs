# What are the most common factors and dietary habits that contribute to flatulence, and how do they affect digestive health?

**#1 Low stomach acidity:** Flatulence is hydrogen and methane gas created by microbes in the process of carbohydrate and fiber fermentation. Your stomach pH should be between 1 and 3—this is highly acidic. Without high stomach acidity, your digestive process is put under stress, causing many digestive issues.

The best remedies for low stomach acidity:

• Betaine hydrochloride

• Apple cider vinegar

**#2 Food intolerance:** Another cause of gas is food intolerance. Lactose intolerance is a common problem that happens when your body lacks the enzymes that break down lactose. In turn, this causes excess gas. You can avoid lactose or take enzymes that help break down lactose. Gluten intolerance is also common—if you’re on Healthy Keto®, you don’t have to worry about gluten or grains. Probiotics can help fortify your microbes and potentially increase enzyme production.

**#3 Gas-producing foods:** Avoid these common gas-producing foods:

• Fruit

• Beans

• Legumes

• Starches (like potatoes and rice)

• Sugar

• Certain cruciferous vegetables (Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage)

• Onions Instead, consume more:

• Lettuce

• Tomato

• Zucchini

• Olives

• Avocado

**#4 Sugar alcohols and fiber:** Keto-friendly low-calorie sweeteners, sugar alcohols, and fiber can cause digestive discomfort when consumed excessively. If you begin to experience gas, reduce your intake of these keto treats.

**#5 Chewing gum:** Chewing gum and chewing with your mouth open can cause you to swallow excess air. Avoid chewing with your mouth open.

**#6 Carbonated Soda:** Carbonated drinks can increase gas in your system, leading to flatulence.
