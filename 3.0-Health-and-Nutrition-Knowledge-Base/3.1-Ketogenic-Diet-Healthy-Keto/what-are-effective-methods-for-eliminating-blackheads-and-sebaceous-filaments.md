# What are effective methods for eliminating blackheads and sebaceous filaments?

We will also explore the root causes and how to address these issues to achieve long-term results.

**Many people mistake sebaceous filaments for blackheads and try to remove them by using tweezers or other methods. However, this can damage the skin.**

**The presence of sebaceous filaments and blackheads is often linked to the overproduction of sebum. This production is regulated by a hormone called androgens, which can increase during puberty, pregnancy, or other hormonal imbalances.**

So, how do we address the root cause of sebaceous filaments? **One way is to regulate and balance our androgen levels through dietary changes. Consuming foods high in vitamin A, D, and omega-3 fatty acids while reducing the intake of seed oils found in processed foods can help decrease sebum production.**

**Another way to reduce and balance androgen levels is through intermittent fasting and the keto diet, which helps lower insulin levels. High levels of insulin can also contribute to the overproduction of sebum.**

Additionally, zinc deficiency has been linked to raised sebum production. Consuming zinc-rich foods such as shellfish and red meat can help address this deficiency. Managing stress levels is also essential, as chronic stress can deplete our zinc levels.
