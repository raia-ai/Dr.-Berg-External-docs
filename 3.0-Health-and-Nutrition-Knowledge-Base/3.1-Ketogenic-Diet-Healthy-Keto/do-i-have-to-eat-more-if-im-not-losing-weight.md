# Do I have to eat more if I'm not losing weight?

The reason that you're not losing weight is that you're not eating enough. So the solution is to just eat more food, right?

This just doesn't make any sense. How could adding more food cause you to lose calories?

**What you do want to do to support healthy weight loss is to increase your nutrients. Vitamins, minerals, and other vital nutrients can help support a healthy body and promote weight loss.**

**The best way to lose weight is to cut out your carbohydrates and eat less frequently.** This doesn't mean you need to lower your caloriesâ€”just avoid any calories from carbohydrates and eat less often. What this does is decreases insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the cause of a slow metabolism.

**If you can't seem to lose weight, this is a sign of insulin resistance.** Chances are, you are eating way too many carbohydrates. Keep in mind that lowering your calories is not a good idea either. Lowering your calories can deplete the body of nutrients and low down your metabolism further. Avoid low-calorie diets! In summary, Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting are the best ways to lose weight and support a healthy body.
