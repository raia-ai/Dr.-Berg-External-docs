# Can I eat chocolate on Keto diet?

Yes, in small amounts. Always consume chocolate that is organic and doesn’t contain sugar. A couple of brands are Lily’s Sweets and Choc Zero. Cacao and dark chocolate are high in oxalates. So if you’re at risk for kidney stones, you may not want to consume either one.

Potential health benefits of dark chocolate and cacao:

• Decreased blood pressure

• Increased HDL and decreased LDL (especially oxidized LDL)

• Decreased risk of heart disease (decreased endothelial dysfunction)

• Decreased cortisol and adrenaline

• Decreased risk of certain cancers

• Decreased insulin (may improve insulin resistance)

• Decreased risk of strokes

• Better mood and increased serotonin (it can act as an antidepressant)

• Increased physical performance

• Increased skin circulation, texture, hydration

• Decreased metabolic syndrome
