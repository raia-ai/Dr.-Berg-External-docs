# Is it possible to alleviate migraines by following a ketogenic diet?

There are many things that can cause a migraine headache. But ketones can potentially help your brain in many ways.

A study in 1930 demonstrated that 28% of migraine sufferers reported having no migraines after being on keto. 25% of migraine sufferers reported less frequent migraines after being on keto.

Recent evidence suggests that migraines may stem from a cerebral energy deficiency. Part of the brain may not be getting energy. This could also relate to insulin resistance, which could be one reason why ketones may be effective. Ketones actually provide an alternative fuel to the brain.

The other factor that may contribute to a migraine is too much oxidative stress compared to how much antioxidant capacity you have. Ketones can act as an antioxidant.

Ketones may not only protect you from free-radical damage, but also they may act as an anti- inflammatory. Your brain loves ketones and actually prefers ketones over glucose.

**Potential benefits of ketones for the brain:**

- Can help improve your mood

- Can help improve your cognitive function (memory, focus and concentration)

- May help improve epilepsy

- Could help increase mitochondria function

- Can help reduce oxidative stress

If you have migraines, you may want to get on the ketogenic diet. It may also be beneficial to consume MCT oil and even exogenous ketones to help boost your ketones further.

**How to help supply the brain with ketones:**

- Do Healthy KetoÂ®

- Eliminate snacks (do intermittent fasting)
