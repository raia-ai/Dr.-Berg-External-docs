# What mechanisms explain how elevated cortisol levels can lead to weight gain?

Cortisol increases your energy in stressful situations by converting energy into sugar. However, when this energy isn't used—such as in a sedentary job—it gets stored as fat. Worse, cortisol can convert muscle into sugar, reducing muscle mass. Additionally, cortisol prevents fat burning, making it difficult to achieve ketosis. To manage cortisol effectively, identify and reduce sources of stress. Follow a Healthy Keto® diet and practice intermittent fasting. Ensure you get plenty of vitamin D, vitamin C, and potassium to support overall health.
