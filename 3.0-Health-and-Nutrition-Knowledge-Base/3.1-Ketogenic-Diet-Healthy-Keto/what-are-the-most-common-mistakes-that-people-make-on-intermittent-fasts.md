# What are the most common mistakes that people make on intermittent fasts?

Intermittent fasting provides a ton of health benefits. But some common intermittent fasting mistakes could cause it to be more difficult than it should be. For example, starting to quick and fasting for too long instead of slowly adjusting your eating window will cause many people to quit. Intaking more potassium, B vitamins and trace minerals can help with this.

Overindulging in carbs during an eating window will also make fasting more difficult as it spikes your insulin levels. Not eating enough nutrients or consuming low-quality ingredients during your eating window will also ruin your fasting experience. Finally, not consuming enough fat during your meals causes you to feel much hungrier during your fast, and can make you want to quit.
