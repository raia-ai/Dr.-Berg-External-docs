# What is the most potent treatment for eradicating candida infections?

Now, we normally have candida living in our bodies without any issue. But when you take an antibiotic, your defenses are lowered and you end up with an overgrowth of candida. This is a fungal infection caused by yeast, the most common being candida Albicans.

If this infection turns your tongue white, that’s a condition called thrush. Sometimes the white patches are on the inside of your cheek; sometimes there are small red patches on your tongue. If the infection is in your vagina, it’s called a yeast infection. If in your esophagus, it’s called candida esophagitis.

Garlic is, hands down, the most powerful fungus killer. It also works on toenail fungus. Garlic has a natural phytochemical called ajoene that’s responsible for its power to kill fungus. Ajoene is also a natural blood thinner; drug companies are researching it to use in medication for blood clotting disorders.

Crush up fresh garlic and put it in your food on a regular basis. But you also have to fix your diet! Lower your sugar intake. Reduce your consumption of milk sugar. I recommend a healthy keto plan with intermittent fasting. If you’re consuming garlic but your sugar and carb consumption is still high, I doubt your fungal infection will go away. You want to starve off the fungus and re-establish the friendly flora in your body.

I also recommend a type of probiotic called effective microbes, to help your gut flora. Garlic has many other phytochemicals that provide you with health benefits. Not only is it anti-fungal, but antibacterial and antiviral as well. Garlic has been shown to be very effective for basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer.

Now you can see how effective garlic is to kill candida.
