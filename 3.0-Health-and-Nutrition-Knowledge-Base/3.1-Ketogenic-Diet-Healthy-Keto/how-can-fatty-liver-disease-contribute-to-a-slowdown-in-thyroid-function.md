# How can fatty liver disease contribute to a slowdown in thyroid function?

Fatty liver disease can stem from excessive alcohol consumption or a diet high in sugars and refined carbohydrates, leading to insulin spikes and insulin resistance. This condition, known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), causes liver inflammation and scar tissue formation.

Common signs include abdominal obesity and can be diagnosed via ultrasound, revealing diminished liver function and reduced bile production. A fatty liver impairs cholesterol regulation and interferes with thyroid hormone conversion (T4 to T3), potentially leading to hypothyroidism and metabolic slowdown.

Addressing these issues with a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting can alleviate insulin resistance symptoms. Increasing intake of cruciferous and other vegetables, along with choline supplements, supports the removal of fat from the liver, aiding in the reversal of fatty liver disease over time.
