# How can I make keto waffles?

**Amazing Low-Carb Waffles Ingredients:**

1 cup almond flour

1 pinch of salt

1 tsp baking soda

4 eggs (organic, pasture-raised)

1⁄4 cup FiberYum

cooking spray (avocado spray)

**Instructions:**

1\. Heat waffle iron per the directions that came with it.

2\. Mix all ingredients above; do not overmix.

3\. Spray both sides of iron with oil before batter is poured in.

4\. Pour batter in and cook per the directions that came with your waffle iron. All are different!

Best served right away. If not, put on a cookie sheet and don’t stack them because they tend to get soft when stacked. Add butter and sugar-free syrup or peanut butter, and enjoy!
