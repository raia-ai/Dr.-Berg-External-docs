# What happens when I overeat?

Overeating can lead to increased stress on the digestive system, causing gas, bloating, nausea, and constipation. Regularly elevated insulin levels can result in insulin resistance (prediabetes) and an overworked pancreas. Poor digestion and excess food intake can also decrease sleep quality and cause the body to convert surplus food to body fat. The following day, you may experience increased cravings, moodiness, inflammation, and a slowed metabolism.
