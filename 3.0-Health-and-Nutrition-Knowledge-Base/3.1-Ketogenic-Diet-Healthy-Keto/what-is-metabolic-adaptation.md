# What is metabolic adaptation?

### **Understanding Metabolic Adaptation**

Your body's metabolism is incredibly adaptable. When you change your diet or fasting routine, your metabolism adjusts accordingly. This process is known as metabolic adaptation.

[During ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-know-you-are-in-ketosis), your body shifts from using glucose as its primary fuel source to [burning fat for energy](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-surprising-ways-to-speed-up-fat-burning-and-lose-weight-faster). This metabolic switch can initially lead to decreased energy levels as your body adapts to using fat for fuel.

However, as you become more fat-adapted, your energy levels stabilize, and you may experience increased mental clarity and physical endurance. [Intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-intermittent-fasting-okay-for-a-diabetic) also triggers metabolic changes.

When you fast, your body enters a ketosis metabolic state, breaking down fat for energy. This process can lead to increased fat burning and potential weight loss.
