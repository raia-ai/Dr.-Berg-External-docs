Bibb butter head lettuce isn't just a salad ingredient anymore. Now, this verdant option provides an excellent and crunchy substitute for the usual bread slices surrounding your burger.

Its sturdy leaves can hold up to even the juiciest of burgers, ensuring you get that satisfying crunch with every bite.

But it's not all about texture; choosing lettuce over bread slashes carbs and adds [nutrients like vitamin A](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-is-vitamin-a-named-retinol) and potassium to your meal.

Moreover, they're scant in [carbohydrates](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-carb-more-deadly-than-sugar-surprising) yet abundant in fiber and protein, offering a dual advantage for those vigilant about their nutritional intake.
