# What is too much fat on a ketogenic diet?

Too much dietary fat can cause:

\- Floating stool

\- Bloating

\- No weight loss

\- Right shoulder/rib pain

\- Nausea

\- Oily stool

\- Lack of appetite

If you have these symptoms, reduce fat to 75 grams per day.

For hypoglycemia, you might need more fat but avoid gallbladder overload. Excess fat between meals prevents burning body fat in ketosis. Combine ketosis with intermittent fasting.

Aim for 70% of calories from fat (20-40g per meal). Gradually increase fat to adapt. Once adapted, you'll burn stored fat more efficiently.
