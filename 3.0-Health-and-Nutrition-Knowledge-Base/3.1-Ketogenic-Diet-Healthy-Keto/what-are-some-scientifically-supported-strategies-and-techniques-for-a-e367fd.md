# What are some scientifically-supported strategies and techniques for accelerating the process of falling asleep, and how can they enhance sleep onset and overall sleep quality?

**First, let’s take a look at the reasons why you might be having trouble getting to sleep.**

1\. Overtraining or too much exercise causes the sympathetic nervous system to go up, keeping your adrenaline high and preventing sleep.

2\. If your room is too hot, it can interfere with your sleep quality.

3\. High carb consumption and stress deplete vitamin B1. Vitamin B1 is essential for the parasympathetic nervous system, so a deficiency will keep you up at night. Try taking vitamin B1 before bed for better sleep.

4\. Too much caffeine is a common cause of poor sleep.

5\. Poor gut health can inhibit good sleep. Kefir as a probiotic can help!

6\. Insulin resistance inhibits the absorption of tryptophan, a precursor to melatonin. This can interfere with your ability to fall asleep fast.

7\. Some people have trouble sleeping after being on keto or the carnivore diet for a long period of time. This is because their insulin is very low. Try having a cup of berries with your last meal to fix this problem.

8\. Sodium deficiency can cause problems with your sleep. This can be caused by fasting, OMAD (one meal a day), or not adding enough sodium to your diet. Low sodium can cause your sympathetic nervous system to go up which can keep you from sleeping.

If you want to know how to fall asleep instantly, try this simple sleep technique! You’re going to breathe in a way that synchronizes your heartbeat and blood pressure to the rhythm of your breathing. This will help stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, inducing sleep very quickly. Try practicing with a timer first! Breathe in for 5 ½ seconds and breathe out for 5 ½ seconds. This will give you about 5 ½ breaths per minute. When doing this technique, breathe through your nose, and within minutes you will fall asleep.
