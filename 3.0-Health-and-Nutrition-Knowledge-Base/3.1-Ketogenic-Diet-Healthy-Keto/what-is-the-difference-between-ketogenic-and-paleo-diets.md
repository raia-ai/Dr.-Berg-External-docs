# What is the difference between ketogenic and paleo diets?

A paleo diet is a dietary plan based on foods similar to what might have been eaten during the Paleolithic era, which dates from approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago.

A paleo diet typically includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds â€“ foods that in the past could be obtained by hunting and gathering. A paleo diet limits foods that became common when farming emerged about 10,000 years ago. These foods include dairy products, legumes and grains.

Paleo, despite being healthy, allows more carbs from fruit and sweet potato or yams. Paleo also allows you to eat a greater percentage of protein compared to the ketogenic diet, where your only carb source is vegetables and you consume high amounts of fat and moderate amounts of protein.
