# How do avocados benefit you?

Avocado consumption supports healthy weight, improves skin and vision health, and lowers the risk of developing diseases, including heart disease, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, certain cancers, and arthritis. 

Avocados promote weight loss and support weight maintenance. They contain around 75% fat and are high in fiber, promoting satiety and reducing hunger. Avocados also contain a fat molecule called avocatin B, which boosts your metabolism and promotes fat-burning.  

Avocados are rich sources of insoluble fiber linked to digestive health and improved detoxification. This type of fiber helps the beneficial bacteria in your gut to thrive, supporting immune function and lowering inflammation. 

Several of the nutrients in avocados have potent antioxidant properties, including vitamin E, vitamin C, and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin. Antioxidants protect your cells from harmful oxidative damage linked to premature aging and the development of diseases.
