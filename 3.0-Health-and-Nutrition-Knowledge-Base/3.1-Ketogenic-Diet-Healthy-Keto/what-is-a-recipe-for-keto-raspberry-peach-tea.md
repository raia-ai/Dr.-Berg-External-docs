# What is a recipe for Keto Raspberry Peach Tea?

This is an amazing keto raspberry peach tea. It has muddled raspberries, mint, and lemon in a nice peach tea.

This fantastic keto-friendly drink is not only tastyâ€”it has some health benefits as well. It has a little bit of collagen in it, and it's great for the skin! To keep it keto-friendly, we don't actually use fresh peaches in this drink. The peach flavor comes from the peach tea. This means that it doesn't have all of the extra sugar that peaches have.

Of course, drinking plenty of water is great! But, drinking only water can get old for some people. With this drink, you can switch things up on occasion with something that's fresh, super tasty, and healthy! This keto drink recipe is very simple and doesn't take long to make, which also makes it perfect for serving when you have company.
