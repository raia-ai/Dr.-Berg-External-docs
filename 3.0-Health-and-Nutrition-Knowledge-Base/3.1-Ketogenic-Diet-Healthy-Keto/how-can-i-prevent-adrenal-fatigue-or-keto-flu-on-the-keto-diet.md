# How can I prevent adrenal fatigue or keto flu on the keto diet?

If you are suffering from fatigue and keto flu, you may need to consume more sea salt. Low blood pressure and lightheadedness are two more signs you may be suffering from a lack of salt. Starting a keto plan prompts significant water loss, as high-carb diets typically lead to water and sodium retention. Opt for sea salt over table salt; Himalayan pink sea salt, being unrefined, is preferable. Table salt often contains additives like dextrose, making natural salts like Himalayan pink sea salt a better choice for overall health.

Himalayan pink sea salt is beneficial because it:

• Is unrefined

• Has 84 minerals

• Is unpolluted

• Contains trace minerals

• Is antimicrobial

• Can help support healthy blood sugars
