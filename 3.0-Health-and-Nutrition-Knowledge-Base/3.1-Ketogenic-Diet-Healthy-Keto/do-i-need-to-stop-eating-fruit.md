# Do I need to stop eating fruit?

You don't need to eliminate fruit entirely on a keto diet. Berries are a suitable option as they are lower in sugar compared to other fruits.

Some individuals, particularly those following a carnivore keto approach, incorporate fruit and honey due to their improved metabolic flexibility and lack of insulin resistance. However, this is not suitable for everyone. Many people may struggle to metabolize higher-sugar fruits, leading to potential complications.

For most individuals, it is advisable to limit fruit intake to maintain ketosis and avoid metabolic issues, unless they are highly active and can effectively burn off the extra sugars.
