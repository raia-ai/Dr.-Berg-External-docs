# What's the difference between ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting?

The ketogenic diet (keto) and intermittent fasting are two different dietary approaches with different focuses. Keto is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that aims to induce ketosis, where the body burns fat for fuel, by strictly reducing sugar and carb intake. In contrast, intermittent fasting centers on the timing of meals, alternating between periods of eating and fasting, without specifying what foods to eat.

While keto requires significant changes to food choices to maintain specific macronutrient ratios, intermittent fasting offers flexibility and can be combined with various diets, including keto. Combining keto and intermittent fasting can have many health benefits, including weight loss and autophagy (cellular renewal).
