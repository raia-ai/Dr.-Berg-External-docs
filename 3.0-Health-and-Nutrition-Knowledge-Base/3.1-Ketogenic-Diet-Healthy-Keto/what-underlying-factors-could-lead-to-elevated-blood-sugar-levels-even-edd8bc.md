# What underlying factors could lead to elevated blood sugar levels even in the absence of sugar consumption?

Even if you don't consume sugar, you can still have high blood sugar due to your liver and kidneys producing glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis. This process generates sugar from non-carbohydrate sources like fat and protein, and is regulated by insulin. If your insulin levels are too low or if you have insulin resistance, gluconeogenesis may not be properly turned off, leading to elevated blood sugar levels. Addressing insulin resistance could help manage and lower your blood sugar more effectively.
