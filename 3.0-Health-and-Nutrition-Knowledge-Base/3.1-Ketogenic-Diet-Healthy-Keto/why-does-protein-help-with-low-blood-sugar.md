# Why does protein help with low blood sugar?

With hypoglycemia, insulin lowers high blood sugar, often too much, resulting in low blood sugar. This happens because people with hypoglycemia have high insulin levels and lack counteracting hormones. While glucose, fat, and ketones are common fuels, protein can also be converted into glucose via gluconeogenesis, providing energy and helping stabilize blood sugar.

Consuming protein helps balance blood sugar by stimulating both insulin and glucagon, unlike carbohydrates, which can cause a temporary spike followed by a drop. We recommend adopting a Healthy KetoÂ® diet and intermittent fasting for those with hypoglycemia.
