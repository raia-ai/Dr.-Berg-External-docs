# Can I follow the keto diet if Iâ€™m prone to kidney stones?

Number one, you have to keep your fluids a little higher because you're gonna lose a lot of fluid on the ketogenic diet, right? So we want to keep the fluids to at least two and a half liters of fluid a day, and then you'll be good.

The most common type of kidney stone is the oxalate version, and so making sure that your urine is acidic would be a smart thing, okay? Because when you become too alkaline, that's when you can start developing more stones. But if you have a uric acid stone, you want to do the opposite, and you want to alkalize the body.

And then one last point. Make sure that you avoid spinach, almonds, chocolate, because they're very high in oxalates.
