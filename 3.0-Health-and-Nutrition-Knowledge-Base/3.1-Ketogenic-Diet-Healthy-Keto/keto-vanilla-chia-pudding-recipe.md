# Keto Vanilla Chia Pudding Recipe

This low-carb vanilla chia pudding makes a great ketogenic snack. It contains chia seeds, which gives it a great consistency. Not to mention, chia seeds are really healthy. Chia seeds have omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, they're high in protein, and they're nutritious. Women especially need omega 3 fatty acids to help balance hormones. We sweeten this with vanilla cream stevia.
