# Does fat put me in ketosis on keto?

Many people think it takes consuming more fat to put your body into the state of ketosis.

The truth is, you don’t necessarily need to consume more fat. Instead, you need to lower your carbohydrates. Carbs affect insulin, and insulin blocks ketosis. The key is to lower your carbs.

Ketosis is also not a high-protein diet. You want to consume only a moderate amount of protein. 3-8 oz of protein is fine. You also don’t want to consume lean protein—low-fat protein can exacerbate insulin spikes. Always consume full-fat foods.
