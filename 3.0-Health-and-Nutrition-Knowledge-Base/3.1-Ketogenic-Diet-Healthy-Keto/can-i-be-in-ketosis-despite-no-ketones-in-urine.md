# Can I be in ketosis despite no ketones in urine?

**The first thing you need to know is that there are three types of ketones:**

1\. Acetate

2\. Acetoacetate

3\. Beta-hydroxybutyrate

**The specific type of keto that keto urine tests test for is acetoacetate.** Keto urine tests do not test for the other two forms of ketones. As you adapt to keto, you convert acetoacetate to beta-hydroxybutyrate. The problem is that keto urine tests cannot test for beta-hydroxybutyrate, so they may give you a false reading.

Keto urine tests can’t tell you what’s going on in the blood and other places in the body.

If you want to check for beta-hydroxybutyrate, you can get a blood test. Unfortunately, these tests can be expensive. Look for other signs that you’re in ketosis. Are you losing weight? Are you feeling good? Is your waist size getting smaller? These are signs that you’re in fat-burning mode. If your carbs are 20 grams or less each day, you’re likely in ketosis.
