# Keto Quiche Recipe

If you’re in a rush or maybe you even hate to cook, this quick and simple recipe is for you. You can make this keto-friendly quiche recipe in advance to enjoy later. You can also make the pie crust and egg mixture separately and freeze them both to have on hand.  You can double or triple this recipe to make a variety of quiches to freeze and have at any time of the day. What Karen Berg did, was made a large batch of the egg mixture, poured it into six different pie crusts, and then filled them with different things. You can really customize these however you’d like.

**The different keto-friendly quiches Karen Berg made are:**

• Chicken and sharp cheddar 

• Veggie 

• Bacon, onion, and cheddar 

• Ham and swiss

• Spinach and salmon 

• Cheese and sausage 

The crust for this quiche is not wheat. It’s made with almond flour. These crusts are also super fast and easy to make. 

**The secret if you want a quiche with different things in it: Cook the meat and saute the vegetables ahead of time, add those ingredients to the crust first, then pour the egg on top of that.**
