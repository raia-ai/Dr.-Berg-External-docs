# What are the potential health benefits of incorporating lupin flour into the diet?

Lupin flour comes from the lupin bean, which is a legume similar to a peanut. It’s non-GMO, and it has a neutral taste. It also has a great texture that’s very similar to other flours. It has been consumed in certain parts of the world for a very long time, and it’s loaded with antioxidants. Lupin flour is even very low on the glycemic index.

It should be noted that lupin flour does have some lectins and phytic acid, which some people are sensitive to. But most people shouldn’t have a problem with it.
