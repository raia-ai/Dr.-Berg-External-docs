# What is the role of dietary cholesterol for healthy heart?

### **The Role of Dietary Cholesterol in Heart Health**

First, let's talk about [cholesterol](https://www.drberg.com/blog/cholesterol-basics-101-by-dave-feldman-and-dr-berg)—specifically, dietary cholesterol—the kind found in foods like eggs, meat, and dairy.

For years, conventional wisdom held that dietary cholesterol was public enemy #1 for heart health. The thinking went: you eat cholesterol, your blood cholesterol levels rise, and your heart suffers.

However, fresh investigations have questioned this long-held belief, suggesting it might not be as straightforward as once thought. Emerging research indicates that ingesting cholesterol doesn't significantly alter blood cholesterol figures for most people.

Interestingly, a 2018 investigation unveiled that consuming as many as a dozen eggs weekly doesn't elevate heart disease risk in individuals with no pre-existing health issues.

So, what gives? It turns out that the relationship between dietary cholesterol and heart health is a lot more complex than we once thought.

Factors like genetics, overall diet quality, and lifestyle habits all play a role in determining how your body responds to cholesterol intake.

### **Observational Studies vs. Clinical Trials**

To really understand the egg-heart connection, we need to discuss the different types of nutrition research available.

On the one hand, you've got observational studies. These look at large groups of people and try to find links between specific foods or nutrients and health outcomes.

The problem with observational studies is that they can't prove cause and effect. Just because egg-eaters have a higher risk of heart disease doesn't necessarily mean that eggs are to blame.

On the other hand, you've got clinical trials. In these meticulously designed studies, participants are randomly sorted into varied dietary factions, and their well-being is monitored over time.

In nutrition research, clinical trials reign supreme due to their ability to definitively demonstrate causality. And when it comes to eggs and heart health, the clinical trial evidence is pretty reassuring.

## **Heart-Healthy Choices** 

When comparing brown [eggs to hot dogs](https://www.drberg.com/keto-recipes/eggs-grassfed-hot-dog-and-kaleshake), the health benefits are clear: brown eggs are a rich source of protein, vitamins, and minerals essential for overall health.

Hot dogs often contain high levels of sodium, saturated fats, and preservatives, which can increase the risk of heart disease and other health issues.

Brown eggs provide nutrients like vitamin D, B12, and selenium, supporting immune function, bone health, and metabolism. In contrast, hot dogs are processed meats linked to an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease.

We must make informed choices about what we consume, opting for nutrient-dense foods like brown eggs over processed options like hot dogs to support optimal health.
