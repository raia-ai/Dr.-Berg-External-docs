# What are the primary causes of low testosterone, and how do factors such as age, hormonal imbalances, and medical conditions contribute to this issue?

Low testosterone in men mainly is caused by the excess amount of other hormones in your body that counter testosterone. These hormones are cortisol, insulin and especially estrogen. The main remedy is to decrease the amounts of these hormones, which should greatly improve this condition.

**Symptoms:**

- Decreased libido

- Decreased erections

- Decreased vitality

- Weight gain (midsection)

- Can’t build muscle mass

- Skin thinner and softer

- Voice higher

- Prostate enlargement

- Breast tissue (man boobs)

- Loss of body hair

- Loss of collagen

- Reduction of sperm

**Cause #1: High estrogen**

High amounts of estrogen (the female hormone that is also produced in small amounts in a male body) can greatly lower the amounts of testosterone in your body. Consuming foods that are high in estrogen (like soy or GMO foods) can do that. If you have high amounts of body fat, it can do that too, as human body fat contains certain proteins that convert testosterone to estrogen.

**Remedies:**

- Consume foods that will lower estrogen levels:

    - cruciferous vegetables (natural estrogen blockers)

    - DIM (concentrated cruciferous)

    - white button mushrooms

    - mushrooms in general

    - celery

    - parsley

    - olive oil

- Avoid foods that will increase estrogen:

    - soy

    - vegetable oils

    - GMO foods

    - alcohol

    - soy-fed chicken

    - soy-fed beef

**Cause #2: High insulin**

One of the effects of insulin (the fat-storing hormone) is to lower testosterone in your body. If you are on a high-carb diet, this will increase the amount of insulin produced by your body to lower the blood sugar spikes after meals. Consuming snacks too often will raise insulin level after each of those snacks, too.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid refined sugar and carbs

- Avoid snacking

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

**Cause #3: High cortisol**

Your body is producing the stress hormone called cortisol to help you adapt to stressors from your environment. Cortisol in itself will lower testosterone levels in the body. If the stress is constant, or chronic, this can overwork your adrenals--making them produce excess cortisol too often.

**Remedies:**

- Take vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

- Improve your sleep

    - avoid blue lights (computer/phone) before going to bed

    - disconnect electronic devices from the outlets before going to bed

    - take naps if needed

    - try to go to bed before 10:30 p.m.

- Avoid watching news (bad news can keep you in a bad mood)

- Take magnesium

- Take vitamin D

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Take long walks outside (at least 45 minutes)

- Regularly exercise (don’t overtrain)

- You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support

- You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Cause #2: High amounts of stress**
