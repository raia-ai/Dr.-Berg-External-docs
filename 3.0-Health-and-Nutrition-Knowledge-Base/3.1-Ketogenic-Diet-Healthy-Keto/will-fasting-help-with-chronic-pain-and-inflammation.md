# Will fasting help with chronic pain and inflammation??

Fasting has a significant influence on chronic pain management. Regular intermittent fasting or prolonged fasting can help generate ketones, which serve as an alternative fuel source with antioxidant properties that protect neurons and have anti-pain effects. Fasting also releases and recycles serotonin, a mood-related neurotransmitter that can reduce neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, conditions often exacerbated by low serotonin levels.

Additionally, fasting stimulates neurogenesis, the regrowth of nerve cells, which can expedite recovery from nerve damage and alleviate pain. The process releases endorphins, improving mood and decreasing pain. Fasting also affects neurotransmitter receptors and increases BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which supports brain health and repair. In contrast, frequent eating or overeating may lead to increased oxidation in the vascular system, negatively impacting nerve health.
