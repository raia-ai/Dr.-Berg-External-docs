# What are kidney stones, and what effective strategies and treatments can be employed to eliminate them and prevent their recurrence?

To prevent kidney stones, maintain hydration by drinking 2-3 liters of fluids daily, ideally with electrolytes like potassium citrate. Limit oxalate-rich foods such as almonds and spinach, especially on a ketogenic diet. Increase dietary calcium from sources like cheese to bind oxalates in the gut.

If fat malabsorption is an issue, additional calcium may help reduce oxalate absorption. Supplementing with citrates—like lemon juice or potassium, magnesium, and calcium—can lower oxalate levels. Balance urinary pH by increasing vegetable intake or using potassium citrate, especially for uric acid stones.

Support gut health with probiotics and ensure sufficient magnesium and vitamin D intake. Additionally, consider adding salt and vitamin K2 to help prevent calcification.
