# Does my diet affect my knee pain and arthritis?

The foods you eat can have a significant impact on knee pain and arthritis. It all comes down to the balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in your diet.

[Omega-6 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-6-fats-and-inflammation) are found in many common foods, such as vegetable oils and processed snacks. While some omega-6 is necessary for health, consuming too much can contribute to inflammation in the body, which can worsen [knee pain](https://www.drberg.com/blog/knee-pain-relief) and arthritis symptoms.

### **The Impact of Omega-6 Fatty Acids on Inflammation**

These compounds can contribute to joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in people with knee arthritis. Some common sources of omega-6 fatty acids include:

- Soybean oil

- Corn oil

- Sunflower oil

- Safflower oil

- Processed snacks and baked goods

- Fried foods
