# What's healthier chicken or pork?

Typically, commercial chicken and pork from a grocery store are highly processed. I never recommend consuming that type of meat.

**Problems with processed meat:**

• It’s factory farmed 

• The animals consume GMO grains 

• The animals are given antibiotics 

• The animals are given drugs that are arsenic-based 

• The animals are given formaldehyde 

Personally, I prefer pork because it’s fattier meat. If you have chicken with skin, the skin does provide some fattiness. Just remember that if you’re on the ketogenic diet, you want more fat in your diet. Lean meats stimulate insulin levels more than fatty meats. Pork would be better on your insulin levels.
