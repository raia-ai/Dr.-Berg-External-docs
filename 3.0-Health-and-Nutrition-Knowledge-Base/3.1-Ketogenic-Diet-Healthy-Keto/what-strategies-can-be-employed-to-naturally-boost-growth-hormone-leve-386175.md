# What strategies can be employed to naturally boost growth hormone levels as you age?

In adults, growth hormone is essential for muscle building, fat burning, and overall health, including joints and bones. Aging leads to declining levels, affecting muscle, cognition, mood, and metabolic health.

Factors hindering growth hormone include insomnia, sleep apnea, high blood sugar, insulin, chronic stress, and liver issues. Rather than synthetic replacements, supporting natural production through methods like intense exercise, milk thistle for liver support, a Healthy KetoÂ® diet, and intermittent fasting is recommended.

For ketogenic dieters experiencing muscle dehydration, adequate electrolyte-rich hydration and adjusting carb intake to around 50 grams per day from sources like berries can help maintain muscle health without refined carbs and sugars.
