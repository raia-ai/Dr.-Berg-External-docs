# Can anyone do Keto?

The ketogenic diet is generally considered safe and well-tolerated by most people and has been found especially beneficial for obese individuals and those with type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, PCOS, metabolic syndrome, and elevated cholesterol levels. 

However, individuals with eating disorders and those taking medications that impact fat metabolism should consult a healthcare provider before starting a ketogenic diet to minimize the risk of side effects.
