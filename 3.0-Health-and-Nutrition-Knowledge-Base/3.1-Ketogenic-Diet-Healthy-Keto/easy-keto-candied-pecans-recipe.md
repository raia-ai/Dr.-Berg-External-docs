# Easy Keto Candied Pecans Recipe

My favorite nut is the pecan, and these sugar-free candied pecans are just amazing. If you’re looking for healthy snacks, you can add this to the list. I would put these on a salad or even keto-friendly ice cream. These are incredible. They are really sweet but yet they are low-carb, and there is no sugar in them. Pecans are also loaded with vitamin B6. 

**Keto Candied Pecans Recipe:**

**Ingredients**

• 1 egg white 

• 1 pound pecan halves

• ½ cup sugar substitute (we use Just Like Sugar)

• 3 tsp ground cinnamon

• ½ tsp sea salt

**Directions**

1\. In a large bowl, beat the egg white until frothy but not stiff. Add the pecans into the bowl and mix well so all the nuts are covered with egg whites. 

2\. In a small bowl, combine the cinnamon, salt, and sugar. Sprinkle the sugar mixture onto the nuts and mix bit by bit until all the mixture has been added. Mix well to coat thoroughly. 

3\. Pour candied nuts onto a parchment or silicone mat-lined baking pan and spread them out as evenly as you can. 

4\. Bake at 325°F for 20 minutes, stirring about halfway through. It is vital not to overcook. Let it cool. Break nuts apart a bit with hands. Store in a ziplock bag or airtight container.
