# Why my hypoglycemia is back and I'm on Keto?

Someone was having an issue with keto where they said that keto didn’t work because even though they did keto and felt better after doing it for a month, they went back on their diet, and their hypoglycemia came back.

What causes hypoglycemia (low blood sugars) is something you ate that’s triggering insulin, and the insulin is pushing your blood sugars down. When you have hypoglycemia, you may think you need to consume sugar because your sugar is low. But, the problem with this is that you’re just going to activate insulin again, which will bring the blood sugar back down. I don’t believe you can correct hypoglycemia by consuming more carbs.

When someone starts the keto diet, they also really need to commit to it for longer than one month. If a person has hypoglycemia, they have very severe insulin resistance. It could take several years before this person could get into a stabilized position, and if the person was to go back to carbs, the situation would just come back. The keto and intermittent fasting plan is designed to be a lifestyle change.
