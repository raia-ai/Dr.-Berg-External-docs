# How long does Keto flu last?

Usually 1 to 2 days. It can span up to 6 weeks or longer depending on how long you have been living on sugar and how bad your liver is.

If you support yourself during the transition period with the right nutrition (electrolytes and B vitamins) keto flu should go away pretty fast.
