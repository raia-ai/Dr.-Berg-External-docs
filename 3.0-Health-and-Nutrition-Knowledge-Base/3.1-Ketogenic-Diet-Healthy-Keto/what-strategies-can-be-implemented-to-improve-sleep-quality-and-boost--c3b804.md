# What strategies can be implemented to improve sleep quality and boost overall energy levels throughout the day?

**To improve sleep:**

1\. Add more vegetables - 7-10 cups per day.

2\. Avoid excess protein - 3-6 ounces.

3\. Avoid too much caffeine

4\. Don't snack in the evening

5\. Avoid sugar - excess insulin causes your bladder to more active.

6\. Avoid over-training - and walk regularly.

**If you can't get to sleep - you need minerals (calcium, potassium and magnesium)**

**If you wake up at 2am in the middle of the night, then support your adrenals.**

**If your bladder is waking you up too much, then this is insulin resistance. Get on the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting.**
