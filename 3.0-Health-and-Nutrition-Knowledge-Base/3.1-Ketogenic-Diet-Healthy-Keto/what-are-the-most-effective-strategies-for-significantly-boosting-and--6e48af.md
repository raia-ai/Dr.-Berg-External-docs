# What are the most effective strategies for significantly boosting and sustaining energy levels?

**Coffee doesn't give you energy. I**t gets rid of the fatigue molecule so that you don’t feel tired. Glucose and sugar might seem to give you an energy boost, but they actually make you tired!

**Here are 7 ways to raise your energy levels naturally without a crash.**

**1\. Magnesium**

Magnesium is a cofactor to make ATP, which is like the battery source for the body. The #1 symptom of low magnesium is fatigue. Magnesium-rich foods include spinach, almonds, avocado, and fish.

**2\. Sodium-potassium pump**

The sodium-potassium pump in your cells allows you to generate an electrical charge that powers your muscles and your nervous system. Adequate sodium and potassium intake is crucial for healthy energy levels. Electrolyte powder can help if you’re not consuming enough sodium and potassium from your diet.

**3\. Mitochondrial biogenesis**

Creating more mitochondria through consistent exercise can boost energy levels. Fasting, intermittent fasting, cold therapy, and polyphenols can also increase mitochondria. Polyphenols are found in certain vegetables, herbs, berries, and dark chocolate.

**4\. Ketones**

If you follow a keto diet, you can get your body running on ketones. Ketones produce more energy than glucose.

**5\. Carnitine**

Carnitine is a compound that can help transport fat into the mitochondria. Carnitine helps increase exercise endurance, delays the fatigue factor, and acts as an antioxidant to decrease damage in the muscles. Red meat is the best source of carnitine.

**6\. Apple cider vinegar**

Apple cider vinegar can be used by the mitochondria as fuel. Add one tablespoon to a glass of water each day.

**7\. B vitamins**

B vitamins are intimately involved with every part of your mitochondria that generates ATP from your food. Nutritional yeast is one of the best sources of B vitamins.
