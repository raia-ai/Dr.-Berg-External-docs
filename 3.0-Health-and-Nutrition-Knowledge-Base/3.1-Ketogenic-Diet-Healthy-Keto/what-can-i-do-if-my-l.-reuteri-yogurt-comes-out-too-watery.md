# What can I do If my L. Reuteri Yogurt comes out too watery?

The watery portion is whey, a natural resultant of the fermentation process.  The whey can be stirred into the yogurt and eaten as-is or enjoyed with berries or stevia.  

How to Help Reduce the Whey 

The more thoroughly and rapidly the components are mixed, the greater the potential reduction in whey. 

First, add your starter culture, either an L. reuteri capsule or three tablespoons of yogurt from a previous batch, to your mixing bowl. Then, as you add one tablespoon of inulin, stir vigorously for a few secondsâ€”longer if you're using yogurt from a previous batch. Stir by hand; machine mixing can harm bacteria. Keep your container of organic half-and-half ready near your mixing bowl while you do this.\*\*\*\* 

Next, after the starter culture and inulin are mixed immediately add your half and half, it can be more than 2 tablespoons, it can even be 2-4oz, stirring vigorously.   

The key is that it all mixes well with no lumps at all, without any sticking to the spoon/fork (which you don't want) or the bottom of the mixing bowl itself, as it's easy to miss, so make sure you do a quick check.   

Once quickly and thoroughly mixed, put the mixture in your bowls/ jars evenly (with jars, it helps to use a 1/2 cup measuring cup) and make sure your water levels are even or slightly above the water line just to be sure:)
