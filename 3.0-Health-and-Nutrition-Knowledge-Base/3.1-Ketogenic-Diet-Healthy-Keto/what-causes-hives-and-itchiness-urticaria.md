# What causes hives and itchiness-urticaria?

**Understanding Itchiness, Hives, and Bile Salts**

Itchiness and hives can sometimes be linked to low bile salt levels. Here's why:

- **Bile's Role in Digestion:** Your liver produces bile, which is stored and concentrated in your gallbladder. When you eat, your gallbladder releases bile into your small intestine. Bile works with enzymes to break down fats and absorb essential vitamins and fatty acids from your food.

- **Bile Release and Stomach Acid:** Adequate stomach acid (a specific pH level) is needed to trigger bile release.

**Conditions Linked to Itchiness, Hives, and Low Bile Salts:**

- **Acid Reflux and GERD:** These digestive issues can interfere with proper bile release.

- **Gallbladder Removal:** Without a gallbladder to store bile, its release could be disrupted.

- **Liver Dysfunction:** Liver problems can impair bile production.

- **High Cholesterol and Gallbladder Stones:** These conditions may affect bile flow and function.

**Potential Remedies for Low Bile Salts:**

- **Purified Bile Salts:** Bile Salt Supplements

- **Healthy Ketosis and Intermittent Fasting:** These dietary approaches should be discussed with a healthcare professional to see if they could improve bile production and function.
