# What is the recommended protocol for managing and treating calcified plaque in the arteries?

**What you could do for calcification in the arteries:**

1\. Allicin  This is a phytonutrient in garlic. There is some interesting research on the association of allicin and decreased artery calcification in animals. 

2\. Butyrate  This is a compound that the microbes in the gut make when you feed them fiber (vegetable fiber). It’s a type of fat, a small-chain fatty acid. Butyrate has been associated with a decreased risk of artery disease. 

3\. Lycopene  This is a phytonutrient in certain vegetables. There is some interesting data showing how lycopene can decrease the thickness of the wall of the arteries and decrease the stiffness. 

4\. Omega-3 fatty acids  You can find this in cod liver oil or fish oils. Omega-3 fatty acids may help decrease inflammation.

5\. GLA (gamma-linolenic acid)  This is a type of omega-6 fatty acid that is actually friendly to your arteries. A few examples would be borage oil, black currant seed oil, and evening primrose oil. GLA may help decrease inflammation, decrease the thickness of the arteries, and decrease plaque formation in the arteries. 

6\. Vitamin K2 (MK-7 version) You may want to consider consuming 300mcg of vitamin K2 every day. Vitamin K2 can activate a certain protein that inhibits calcium from forming in the arteries. 

7\. Tocotrienols  This is one form of the vitamin E complex. Tocotrienols can greatly decrease inflammation in the arteries. 

8\. Decrease insulin resistance  Do whatever you can to decrease and reverse insulin resistance. There is a direct relationship between having insulin resistance and having calcification in the arteries. A lot of these other remedies may not work unless you also fix insulin resistance. You can help fix insulin resistance by doing the healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting. 

**The most important combination:**

• Address insulin resistance 

• Tocotrienols 

• Vitamin K2 

• Allicin 

• Omega-3 fatty acids 

**Secondary**:

• Butyrate 

• Lycopene 

• GLA
