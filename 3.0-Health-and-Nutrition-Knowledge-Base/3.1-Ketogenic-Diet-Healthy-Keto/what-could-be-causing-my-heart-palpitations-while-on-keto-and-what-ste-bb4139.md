# What could be causing my heart palpitations while on keto, and what steps should I take?

As your body gets rid of stored sugars it doesnâ€™t need, you lose a lot of water and this flushes out minerals. Add more potassium. We recommend trying Dr. Berg's Electrolytes Powder. 1 scoop of this formula is loaded with 1000 mg of potassium! This drink is 100% keto-friendly!
