# Does eating fat lower cholesterol?

Your body makes 3000 milligrams of cholesterol each day. That’s the equivalent of 14 eggs or a pound of butter every single day. If you lower your dietary cholesterol, your body will make more to compensate.

**High-fat diets are often associated with high cholesterol, but fat isn’t the problem! Low-fat diets are also high in carbohydrates, which spike insulin and raise cholesterol. A high-fat diet like keto is an ideal diet for a healthy cholesterol level.**

On keto, it is still important to avoid unhealthy fats like trans fats, hydrogenated oils, soy oils, and deep-fried foods. Instead, opt for healthier fatty foods.

**Here are a few examples:**

•Avocado

•Nuts

•Grass-fed meat

•Grass-fed dairy

•Grass-fed butter

•Wild-caught fish

•Cod liver oil

These healthy fats are not harmful to your cholesterol or your heart. A low-carb, high-fat diet can prevent insulin spikes and help lower cholesterol. The majority of the population will experience lowered cholesterol by following a low-carb diet. As fat cells release stored fat, you may notice a temporary increase in blood cholesterol levels when you begin a ketogenic diet, but remember this is only temporary. Try keto for one month and check your cholesterol levels!
