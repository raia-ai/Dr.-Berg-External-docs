# Are granola bars keto-friendly and safe to consume?

No.

When you see a box of granola bars, you may note that the packaging says it’s 100% natural and organic, and it contains no artificial flavoring or coloring. That means that it must be healthy – right?

If you read the back label of the granola bars, the “healthy” granola bar may not seem so healthy. Here’s what is in a typical granola bar:

- Whole oats

- Sugar

- Canola oil

- Yellow corn flour

- Soy flour

- Brown sugar syrup

- Baking soda

- Natural flavoring

Keep in mind that the first few ingredients on a particular label typically make up the majority of the product.

These ingredients make up 29 grams of carbohydrates per serving. They are very high on the glycemic index, which means they have the potential to contribute to blood sugar issues and weight gain.

In summary, granola bars are not keto-friendly at all. They contain a massive amount of sugar that will knock you out of ketosis very quickly. Avoid these products at all costs.
