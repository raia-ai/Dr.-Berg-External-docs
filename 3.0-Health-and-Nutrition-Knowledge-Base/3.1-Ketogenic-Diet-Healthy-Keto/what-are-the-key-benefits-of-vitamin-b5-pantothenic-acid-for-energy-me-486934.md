# What are the key benefits of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) for energy metabolism, skin health, and hormone production?

The name of the B5 vitamin is pantothenic acid and it is a cofactor of energy metabolism, specifically for the enzymes that help you break down fat. When you are converting from sugar- burning to ketosis by burning fat, you need vitamin B5 big-time.

The Greek word for this vitamin is “Pantothen” which means “from all quarters” indicating that it is very easy to get from all your foods. When you read about this vitamin you are going to find that it is almost impossible to be deficient in it, because it is everywhere, but actually a lot of people are deficient in it.

B5 allows macronutrients (fats, carbs, protein) to be converted to energy.

**Benefits**

- Vitamin B5 is needed to support enzymes for energy metabolism from carbs, protein and especially fat

- Supports during keto adaptation

- Supports the production of melatonin (sleep hormone)

- Supports the production of acetylcholine (to help you feel awake during the day)

- Is a key nutrient for adrenal function

- Is needed to make cortisol

**Symptoms of deficiency**

- Stress

- Neuro pain

- Inflammation

- Insomnia

- Keto fatigue

**Where to get it**

Typically, B5 is in our foods, but if your gut flora, the friendly bacteria, are incomplete, there will be fewer B vitamins made. Your gut flora also need vitamin D3 to function and low D3 will lessen the number you have of these microorganisms, which are needed to make B5—leading to a deficiency.

**Best foods for vitamin B5:**

• Mushrooms

• Liver

• Avocados

• Cauliflower

• Eggs
