# What are the best snack foods for low blood sugar?

A person with low blood sugar might be accustomed to snacks like protein bars and an apple with peanut butter. There is so much hidden sugar in these snacks that such snacks are nor recommended; with them, every time you snack you are worsening the problem of low blood sugar. You can become a real hypoglycemic which is almost a pre-diabetic situation. Normal blood sugars are between 80 to 90, but not over 100.

When you eat a snack, no matter what you snack on, you elevate your sugars. Once the sugar goes high it triggers the hormone insulin to drive the sugar down, so you end up with a low blood sugar situation. Snacking keeps the blood sugar levels going up and down, up and down, and perpetuates the problem.

The way out of this is to change what you eat at your meals. Watch Dr. Eric Berg’s videos about the Healthy Keto® and intermittent fasting plan; this diet will help you keep your blood sugars under control.
