# Is it possible to lose weight on a ketogenic diet without exercising?

Yes. The diet contributes 85% of the progress with weight loss and exercise contributes only 15%. But then, there are benefits of exercise for your weight goal.

Benefits of exercise:

- Increases oxygen

- Lowers stress

- Increases fitness

- Tones

- Atrophy (Women going through menopause may experience atrophy in thighs and butt. Exercise helps overcome this atrophy.)

- Increases and prevents the loss of muscle mass

- Stabilizes blood sugars

- Improves sleep

- Improves stiff joints

- Increases / improves blood flow

- Strengthens heart

If you have an adrenal problem, the key is to keep the duration of exercise very short, the intensity very high, and the recovery very long. It is also important not to overtrain.
