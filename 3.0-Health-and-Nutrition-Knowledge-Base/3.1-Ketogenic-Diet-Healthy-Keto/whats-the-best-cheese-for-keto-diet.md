# What's the best cheese for Keto diet?

The main names you will see would be "Natural" which means nothing and "Organic" which means without pesticides but you want to see "Grass-Fed." To make it even better look for "100% Grass-Fed" but make sure you do not get low-fat cheese, do the whole milk cheese.

**With 100% Grass-Fed Cheese you will get:**

\- Fat-soluble vitamins A-D-E-K2

\- Omega 3 fatty acids

\- CLA/DHA/EPA/ALA

\- Available Calcium

\- B12

\- Protein
