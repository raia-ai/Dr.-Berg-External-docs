Dietary oxalates aren’t correlated with oxalates in your urine. Just because you consume foods high in oxalates doesn’t mean you will develop any problems. But, preexisting damage to your kidneys, liver, or metabolism can cause you to be unable to process oxalates like you should. Diabetes, prediabetes, insulin resistance, and carb consumption can lead to kidney problems. A lack of certain microbes can also prevent you from breaking down oxalates, causing them to end up in the kidneys. Many people who go on the ketogenic diet no longer have a problem dealing with oxalates. But if you’re still experiencing issues, you can try these tips.

**What to do if you have high oxalate levels or are prone to kidney stones:**

1\. Limit foods high in oxalates or consume them with cheese

2\. Take a probiotic with a mixture of lactobacillus

3\. Maintain higher levels of magnesium and citrates (by consuming magnesium and lemon)

4\. Get plenty of vitamin D

5\. Drink at least two and a half liters of fluid a day
