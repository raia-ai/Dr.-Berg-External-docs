**Cortisol is a stress hormone that turns protein into sugar. It causes your liver to make new sugar out of non-carbohydrate sources, such as fat, ketones and protein. If your cortisol is really high, your body will make a lot of sugar. This increase in sugar will elevate insulin, and insulin makes belly fat. Consuming a high-carb diet and sugar, or eating too frequently can also cause your insulin to spike, leading to belly fat.** **You'll typically notice belly fat after the liver is already fatty because a lot of the visceral fat around the organs comes from a spill-off of fat from the liver.**
