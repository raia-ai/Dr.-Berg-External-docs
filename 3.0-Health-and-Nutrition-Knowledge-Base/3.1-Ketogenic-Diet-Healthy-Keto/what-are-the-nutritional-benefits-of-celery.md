**How to consume it**

Consuming the whole celery will be more beneficial than drinking it as a juice. This is because some of the phytonutrients are in the fiber part of the celery. If you are juicing the celery, you might not get enough of the phytonutrients that are in the fiber part.

Celery seed extract may also be very beneficial.
