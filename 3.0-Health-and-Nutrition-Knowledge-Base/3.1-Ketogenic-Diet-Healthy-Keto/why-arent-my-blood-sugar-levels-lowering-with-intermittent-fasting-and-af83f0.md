# Why aren't my blood sugar levels lowering with intermittent fasting and ketosis?

You likely have severe insulin resistance with high insulin and poor cell absorption, leading to high blood sugars. To lower your blood sugars, try the following:

**1\. Reevaluate Your Diet:** Ensure you're consuming protein, carbs, and fats properly and eating enough vegetables. Consider reducing your carbohydrate intakeâ€”if you eat 50 grams a day, cut it to 20; if 20 grams, reduce to 10 grams.

**2\. Reduce Meal Frequency:** Shorten your eating window by consuming fewer meals.

**3\. Increase Nutrients:** Add B vitamins (from nutritional yeast), potassium (from electrolytes), zinc, and chromium to your diet.

**4\. Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve insulin resistance.

**5\. Address Health Issues:** Focus on the most significant health issues you have and work on improving them.

**6\. Improve Sleep and Manage Stress:** If you have insomnia or high stress, take steps to address these.

**7\. Be Patient:** It may take more time on keto and intermittent fasting to see improvements in your blood sugars.
