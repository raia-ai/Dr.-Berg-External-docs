# Best Keto Crackers

I believe the best keto cracker is the “Finn Crisp Thin Rye Crispbread.” You might be able to find these at a health food store or online. You could add sour cream, cheese, guacamole, or hummus with these as well.

These keto crackers are whole-grain rye crackers. They have a very small amount of gluten, but if you’re gluten-sensitive, these might not be an option.
