**Einkorn is an ancient grain with a texture and mouthfeel similar to gluten-containing bread.** It's often well-tolerated by those with sensitivities.

**Modern grains are high in phytic acid, which can bind with minerals.** This can lead to deficiencies in zinc, iron, magnesium, manganese, calcium, and copper.

**Bread in the U.S. may contain harmful additives like BVO, potassium bromate, and glyphosate.** Toasting bread can also create acrylamide.

**By choosing Einkorn bread, you can enjoy a healthier, more nutritious option.**
