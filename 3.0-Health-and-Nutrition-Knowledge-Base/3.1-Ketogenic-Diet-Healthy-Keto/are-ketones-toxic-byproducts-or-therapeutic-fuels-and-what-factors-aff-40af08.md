# Are ketones toxic byproducts or therapeutic fuels, and what factors affect their role in metabolism and health?

A woman asked me how to respond to her doctor, who told her that being in ketosis is life-threatening. This is completely untrue - yet it’s a surprisingly common mistake that medical professionals make. They confuse nutritional ketosis with another condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, which is indeed life-threatening. It happens if you’re a type 1 diabetic who runs out of insulin, which allows your ketone levels to rise to dangerous amounts. But if you’re not a type 1 diabetic, you won’t run out of insulin, and you aren’t at risk for ketoacidosis.

By contrast, you get into ketosis by dropping your carbohydrate consumption. Your body turns its own fat, and the fat you eat, into ketones. Ketones are therapeutic for your body. They aren’t dangerous!

A lot of research is being done on the benefits of ketones for someone with a brain injury. Ketones are a more efficient fuel. They need less oxygen and produce less waste than glucose. They’re neuroprotective; they guard against nerve damage caused by high levels of glucose. When you switch to a ketogenic diet, you can actually recover damaged brain cells. Your energy goes up; your need for sleep decreases; you can actually decrease your blood flow by nearly forty percent.

Being in ketosis can help prevent protein from accumulating in the brain, preventing the amyloid plaques that lead to Alzheimer’s.

A real danger is high levels of glucose, which can cause substantial health problems, including:

• Brain Shrinkage

• Fluid retention

• Memory loss

• Mood disorders

• Oxidative damage

• Glycation

• Fatigue

• Lowered oxygen levels

• Amyloid plaques
