# Can I eat cauliflower on Keto?

What’s cool about cauliflower is that its low carb, and it tastes like a potato! It seems like a starchy food but without the starch. One cup has 2.6 grams of carbs, but 1.4 grams of fiber makes it a net carb amount of 1.2 grams.

Besides being low carb, cauliflower has a lot of vitamins, especially B vitamins and vitamin C, vitamin E, and vitamin K1. It also has many minerals and trace minerals, especially manganese which is a great antioxidant. But that’s not all. Cauliflower has some serious amounts of phytonutrients (as do all cruciferous vegetables). Phytonutrients act as specialized antioxidants that help with turning certain genes on and off, as well as the maintenance of your DNA.

Keep in mind that the longer you cook cauliflower, the more you destroy its nutrients. 3 minutes of boiling, for example, equals ten minutes of steaming. So steam it for just 5 minutes; but, the way I recommend is to saute it. Ultimately, even if you cook it for a relatively long time, you still get the benefits of cauliflower being a low-carb food along with its fiber. Sometimes when I go to a restaurant I find they have the entire head of cauliflower roasted with cheese on it! And I pretty much eat the whole thing. Cauliflower truly is the ultimate keto food!
