# Can I gain weight from antibiotics?

Yes, antibiotics can contribute to weight gain. You have approximately 1,000 trillion microbes living in and on your body. When antibiotics eliminate beneficial bacteria, it can increase hunger, lead to cravings for unhealthy foods, and cause inflammation. This inflammation can then result in insulin resistance and subsequent weight gain.
