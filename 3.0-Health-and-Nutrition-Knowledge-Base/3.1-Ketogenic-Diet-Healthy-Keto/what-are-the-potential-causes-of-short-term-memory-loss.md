# What are the potential causes of short-term memory loss?

Short-term memory loss can create a lot of difficulties that make life harder. The area of the brain that is responsible for your short-term memory is called the hippocampus. Any type of damage to the hippocampus can cause problems with memory in general.

**Symptoms:**

- Asking the same questions repeatedly

- Forgetting where you just put something

- Forgetting recent events

- Forgetting something you saw or read recently

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiency**

There are several nutrients that are vital for the healthy functioning of the brain. If you are deficient in these nutrients, the hippocampus will be affected most. The good thing is that it can regenerate if you restore your normal levels of those nutrients.

\-Vitamin B1 is a very important vitamin for healthy brain function as well as for your nervous system.

\-Vitamin D has many health-related functions, including healthy development and upkeep of the brain. Out of all the brain areas that are affected by vitamin D deficiency, the hippocampus feels the deficiency most.

\-If you are deficient in zinc (mineral) your hippocampus won’t work properly, resulting in a short-term memory problem.

\-If your brain doesn’t have enough oxygen this can result in damage of the hippocampus.

**Cause #2: High-carb diet**

If you are on a high-carb diet this can result in brain starvation because blood sugar is not the best source of fuel for the healthy functioning of the brain, including the hippocampus. There is another type of fuel that your brain loves: ketones (a byproduct of your body burning its own fat). Additionally, intermittent fasting will trigger certain processes that will regenerate your hippocampus.
