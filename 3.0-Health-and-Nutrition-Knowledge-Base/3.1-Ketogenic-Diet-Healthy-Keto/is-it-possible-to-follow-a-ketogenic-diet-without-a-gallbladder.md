# Is it possible to follow a ketogenic diet without a gallbladder?

Yes.

With the keto diet, 75% of your calories are coming from fat. The purpose of the gallbladder is to store and concentrate bile, which is the detergent that breaks down fats. Foods, especially fats, trigger the release of bile. Bile helps absorb fat-soluble vitamins, essential fatty acids, etc.

Without a gallbladder, you could have incomplete fat digestion or a deficiency in important fat-soluble vitamins.

You could try taking Dr. Berg’s Gallbladder Formula (see drberg.com) if you don’t have a gallbladder, to get more purified bile salts. This could potentially help you have enough bile to support complete digestion. You may also want to do intermittent fasting along with the keto diet.
