# Does intermittent fasting affect eyes and vision?

Diabetes is a major cause of poor vision, affecting the kidneys, heart, nervous system, and eyes, and can lead to diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, macular degeneration, and cataracts. These eye issues stem from insulin resistance, so addressing this can improve eyesight. Intermittent fasting is effective for reducing insulin resistance, normalizing blood sugar, and promoting autophagy, which helps clean up damaged proteins in the eyes. If vision worsens initially on keto and intermittent fasting, it indicates your body needs more time to adapt.
