# Can I do ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting if I'm underweight?

The answer is keto and IF is not just good for weight loss, but for anti-aging, inflammation, cognitive health, mood, and the list go on and on. If you don't need to lose weight, just add more fat to your meals. This will stop the weight loss, so your body will burn the dietary fats and not your own fat.
