# What factors contribute to the ongoing need for increased medication among individuals with diabetes?

What is diabetes? It’s a disease of high blood sugar, caused by eating a lot of carbohydrates. The purpose of diabetes medication is to lower blood sugar. But — this is key — it lowers only sugar in your blood, not in the rest of your body. The medication crams the sugar into other parts of your body. Usually, the sugar is converted into fat.

Your fat cells get bigger, and they spread to your liver, around your other organs, into the pancreas and your brain. Type 2 diabetes is a diet problem, which is why medication will never fix it. The medication hides the real problem and allows it to continue. Eventually, you’ll need more powerful medications for the health problems that chronic high sugar causes.

Then, you experience side effects, leading you to need more drugs for different conditions, and the chain reaction goes on and on! If this is your first time hearing this concept, and you’re a diabetic, I urge you to go on the ketogenic diet and boost your chances of getting off diabetes medication.
