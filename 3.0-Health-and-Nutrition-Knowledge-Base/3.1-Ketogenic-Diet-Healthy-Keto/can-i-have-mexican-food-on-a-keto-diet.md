# Can I have Mexican food on a Keto diet?

Yes, you can enjoy Mexican food on a keto diet by making a few adjustments. Focus on high-quality ingredients and avoid corn, corn tortillas, and wheat products. Instead, opt for dishes featuring guacamole, almond tortillas, and low-carb sauces.

Avoid rice and beans, and you'll still have plenty of flavorful options. For keto-friendly Mexican recipes, you can visit my YouTube channel, which offers a variety of delicious and compliant dishes. It's crucial to know what's on the "okay" list and what to avoid to maintain your keto lifestyle.
