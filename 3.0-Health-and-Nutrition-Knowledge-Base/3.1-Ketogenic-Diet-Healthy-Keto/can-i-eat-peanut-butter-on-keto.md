# Can I eat peanut butter on keto?

Yes. The peanut butter or nut butter should be organic and shouldn’t have any added sugar. There also shouldn’t be any oils in the peanut butter other than peanut oil. Consume in small amounts and don’t overdo it.

Also, peanuts are high in oxalates and those can cause kidney stones. You can add some calcium or cheese with the meal (not separately) to make the oxalates bind in the digestive tract instead of going to the kidney.
