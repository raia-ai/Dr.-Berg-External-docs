# What are some Keto-friendly foods?

Dr. Berg talks about Acceptable Pleasure Foods on the ketogenic diet. These foods are not meant to be consumed as a snack but after the meal as a dessert. These recipes are low carb, however, the bread recipe contains a bit more carb due to a tiny bit of molasses and arrowroot flour, however, it's still a lot smaller than typical bread due to no wheat flour. Also, test the waters with these recipes because some people are sensitive to sugar alcohol and can experience some bloating. Then some people consume excess amounts of these treats and because of the delicious recipes, they eat WAY TOO MUCH- so be careful.
