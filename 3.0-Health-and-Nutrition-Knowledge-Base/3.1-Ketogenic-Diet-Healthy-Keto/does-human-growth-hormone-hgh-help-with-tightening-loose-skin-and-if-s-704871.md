# Does Human Growth Hormone (HGH) help with tightening loose skin, and if so, how does it contribute to skin elasticity and firmness?

**HGH is considered the anti-aging hormone. One of its key functions is anything to do with protein: prevention of muscle mass loss, improvement of the collagen surrounding your joints, and providing a healthy glow to your skin.**

Some people actually get it injected, which I don’t recommend because of the side effects. And it’s expensive, about $1,500 per month. Don’t buy it! Your body makes it in the pituitary gland, and activates it through the liver.

**There are a number of things that will decrease your human growth hormone, including:**

● Stress, with its high levels of cortisol

● Sugar

● High levels of insulin, the result of frequent eating, excessive protein, being diabetic or pre-diabetic

● Overtraining, if you’re exercising too much without enough sleep

● Alcohol

**Now, I’ll explain what increases HGH. They include:**

● Exercise, which can trigger a 400 to 700 percent increase. The key is to do short bursts of high intensity training such as sprints or spin bike intervals.

● Intermittent fasting can increase HGH by up to 1,300 percent in women and 2,000 percent in men. It’s the most potent stimulator of human growth hormone.

● Going on keto, because you decrease insulin

● Getting better quality sleep

● Having a healthy liver. If your liver is fatty or you have cirrhosis, that inhibits the production of HGH.

When you take action to stimulate your own human growth hormone, you can help tighten your sagging skin.
