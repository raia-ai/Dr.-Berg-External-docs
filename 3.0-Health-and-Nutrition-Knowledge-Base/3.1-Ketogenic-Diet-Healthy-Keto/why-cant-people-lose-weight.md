# Why can't people lose weight?

At 18, most people can burn fat easily. But, once a person gets into their forties or older, they start having a more difficult time with weight loss. So, what happens? Well, at age 18, you have the most fat-burning hormones that you will ever have. After 18, these hormones decrease. 

The problem with taking hormones to combat this problem is that your body will start to make even fewer hormones, and it will become dependent on the hormones you're taking. 

You're also born with fat-making hormones that peak around age 18. But, the fat-making hormones don't decrease—they stay the same. This makes trying to lose weight the same way you did when you were 18 impossible.  These fat-making hormones are really what's keeping your last little bit of fat-burning hormones from working. So, instead of taking hormones, why don't we just stop triggering the fat-making hormones? 

Insulin is the hormone that regulates blood sugars. Insulin is triggered by sugar, and it's a fat-making hormone. Cortisol is a stress hormone that's triggered by stress, and it's also a fat-making hormone. 

**How to help lower fat-making hormones to lose weight:** • Avoid sugar  • Reduce your stress
