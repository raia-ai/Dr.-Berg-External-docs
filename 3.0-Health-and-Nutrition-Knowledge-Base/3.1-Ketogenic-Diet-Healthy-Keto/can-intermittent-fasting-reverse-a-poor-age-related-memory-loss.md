# Can intermittent fasting reverse a poor age-related memory loss?

**Age-related memory loss is not normal.** You can improve memory loss, and if it’s not too far gone, you may even be able to reverse poor memory. The key to getting memory, focus, and concentration back is to understand the basic problem and the different factors that relate to it. 

Certain areas in the brain make insulin. These areas are also the same areas that are involved with memory problems that are related to diseases like Alzheimer’s. 

**Areas of the brain that make insulin:**

• Hippocampus – memory, and learning 

• Prefrontal Cortex — short term memory, planning, decision making, goals, differentiating good and bad, trivial vs. important, consequences, selective attention 

• Olfactory Bulb – Sense of smell

If there’s too much insulin, the body protects itself by developing insulin resistance around the blood-brain barrier. After that, the body may start to develop amyloid plaques. Amyloid plaque is a type of protein that sticks together, making the protein unusable and difficult to leave the body. 

**Fasting is one of the most powerful things you can do to avoid amyloid plaques. Starting at 16 hours of fasting, the body starts the process of autophagy (the body starts eating up damaged and misfolded proteins that turn into amyloid plaque).**  

**Action steps for those with Alzheimer’s disease or memory loss signs:**

• Get on healthy keto

• Start fasting

• Take MCT oil

• Take exogenous ketones
