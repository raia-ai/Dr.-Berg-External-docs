Aside from the previously mentioned resveratrol, the following natural methods can also help support healthy mitochondrial function:

- Following a [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-ketogenic-diet-too-extreme) (a way of eating thatâ€™s higher in healthy fats and very low in carbohydrates, causing the body to burn fat for fuel).

- Incorporating cold therapy (think ice baths or cold showers).

- Regular exercise (even moderate activity can make a difference).

- [Intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/intermittent-fasting).
