# I'm on the weight loss journey - can I eat healthy snacks?

People will tell you that in order to lose weight, you need to snack before you get too hungry, or snack to trigger your metabolism or snack to prevent overeating. 

It's snacking camouflaged as "Healthy snacking". All these extra meals even if they are small and healthy create a spike in insulin - this adds up. 

Insulin is the FAT-MAKING hormone, AND IT PREVENTS FAT BURNING. We snack on liquids too. The grocery store is filled with all sorts of new snacks protein bars, jerky, drinks, and granola bars, with added buzz words like "gluten free" or "organic" or "natural", but it's still food. 

Even fruit between meals can block weight loss. I myself cut fruit out between meals and went from 211 pounds to 185 pounds in 6 weeks.
