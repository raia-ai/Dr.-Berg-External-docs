# What are the most effective strategies or therapeutic interventions for managing and alleviating the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)?

One theory is that too much testosterone can cause an enlarged prostate. This is false. In fact, your risk of an enlarged prostate increases with age, and you also have less testosterone (DHT) as you age. High estrogen is the real cause of an enlarged prostate.

Testosterone and estrogen oppose each other. So when you have high estrogen, your testosterone levels lower.

The most common reasons for high estrogen are consuming foods high in estrogen, adrenal fatigue, and having too much body fat.

**The best ways to reduce estrogen are:**

• Get on healthy keto to reduce your body fat

• Consume cruciferous vegetables

• Avoid estrogenic foods (GMOs, foods with added hormones, soy, etc.)

• Sea kelp

• Stinging nettle root (to reduce aromatase, which converts testosterone into estrogen)
