# Cauliflower "Non-Potato" Pancakes Recipe

One of the biggest comfort foods for Karen growing up in Pennsylvania was potato pancakes. She really wanted to find a low-carb alternative to potato pancakes, and cauliflower works perfectly. 

This is a really easy recipe. You don't have to steam the cauliflower, you just mix up the ingredients, and it fries up really nicely. We love to make them in a cast iron pan and serve them warm with sour cream. This is another great recipe to help you get plenty of cruciferous. I think you're really going to love it. 

**Cauliflower 'Non-potato' Pancakes**

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup shredded cauliflower

- ½ cup shredded mozzarella

- 1 egg (If small, use 2.)

- ¼ cup almond flour

- ¼ cup finely chopped onion

- 1 tbl parsley

- 1 tsp salt,

- ½ tsp pepper  

**Directions:**

- Mix all ingredients.

- Heat skillet and add oil until hot. I love the cast iron skillet for this. 

- Drop a mound in the hot pan (about ¼ cup) and press down gently. Let one side become fully brown before turning.  Brown second side.

- Move to a plate with a paper towel to remove excess oil. 

- You may want a little more salt on top.

- Serve warm with a dollop of sour cream.

These are AMAZING!!!
