# How do I boost my discipline for keto and exercise?

Discipline is self-control, not laziness. If you feel lazy, you may just need more energy. Start with the keto diet for increased energy and exercise. Boost your emotions to naturally enhance discipline—listen to music, partner with friends, or surround yourself with upbeat people. Speed up your activities, as moving and talking quickly can boost discipline.

Get a trainer or coach to push you further and provide valuable information. Keep your word to build willpower and integrity. Simplify your meals and workout routines—opt for easy meals and try working out for 10 minutes instead of skipping exercise altogether.
