# Why am I gaining weight on keto?

If you're not losing weight on keto, it might be due to frequent eating or hidden sugars, which keep insulin high and store fat. However, if youâ€™re exercising, muscle gain can make you weigh more even as your waist gets slimmer, indicating keto is working.

To optimize keto:

\- Double-check your carb intake

\- Adjust your fasting pattern

\- Reduce vegetable intake if bloating

\- Limit fat to about 75g

\- Exercise regularly

\- Add 30 minutes to 1 hour of sleep

\- Include apple cider vinegar, potassium, vitamin B1, magnesium, and vitamin D

\- Reduce stress

\- Address underlying health issues
