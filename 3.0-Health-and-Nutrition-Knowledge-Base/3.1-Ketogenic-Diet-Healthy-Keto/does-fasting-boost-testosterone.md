# Does fasting boost testosterone?

Intermittent fasting can potentially increase testosterone by 180%. It does this by triggering the hypothalamus and releasing GRH. Insulin will kill your testosterone levels, and fasting prevents you from having insulin spikes.

As you lose weight, it will likely get easier and easier to stimulate testosterone. Consider fasting for at least 16 hours with an 8-hour eating window. It may also be beneficial to work up to 20 hours of fasting with a 4-hour window of eating.
