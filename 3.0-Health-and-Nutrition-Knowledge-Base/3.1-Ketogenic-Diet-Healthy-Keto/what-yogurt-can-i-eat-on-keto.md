# What yogurt can I eat on keto?

One that’s recommended is a special type of yogurt called Trimona. A few reasons why Trimona is recommended:

- It’s grass-fed

- Its producers use milk from cows that generate A2 protein versus A1 (less allergies)

- It’s organic

- It’s whole fat

- It’s fermented for 30 hours

- It’s not strained

- There are no thickeners or additives

- It’s plain, so it has less sugar

- It’s non-GMO

A serving of Trimona contains:

- 10 g carbs

- 6 g sugar

- 8 g protein

- 8 g fat

Trimona also contains friendly bacteria, including lactobacillus bulgaricus. A few potential benefits of lactobacillus bulgaricus:

- Could help improve lactose intolerance

- Stimulates the immune system

- Supports the liver

- Could help decrease diarrhea

- Could help decrease inflammation in the gut

- Could help decrease constipation
