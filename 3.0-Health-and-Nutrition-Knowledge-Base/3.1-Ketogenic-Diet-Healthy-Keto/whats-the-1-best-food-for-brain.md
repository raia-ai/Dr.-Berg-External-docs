# What's the #1 best food for brain?

It’s a misconception that the brain can't regenerate—certain parts of the brain can regrow.

**The top foods to avoid to support a healthy brain are:**

1\. Omega-6 fatty acids (soy oil, corn oil, canola oil, and cottonseed oil)

2\. Sugar

3\. Refined carbs

The best food to support brain health is wild-caught salmon.

**Wild-caught salmon can help enhance the brain in many ways, including supporting:**

• Memory

• Focus

• Thinking

• Problem-solving

• Learning

It may also be beneficial for those with mood disorders or brain inflammation. Consuming more wild-caught salmon may even help reduce insulin resistance, which is at the core of many brain problems. The brain is the fattiest organ in the body. Omega-3 fatty acids are the healthy fats your brain needs. They’re the building blocks of your brain. Wild-caught salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids.

Wild-caught salmon is keto-friendly. It’s low-carb and has a good amount of protein and nutrients. But, to get these incredible benefits for the brain, be sure the salmon you choose is wild-caught and not farm-raised. Try having your salmon with a kale salad topped with olive oil and unfortified nutritional yeast to take your brain health to the next level.
