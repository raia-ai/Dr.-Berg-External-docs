# What are the benefits of insulin beyond glucose regulation, and how does it support metabolic health and manage certain conditions?

The main reason why the keto diet and intermittent fasting work so well to support a healthy body is that they both help lower insulin. However, insulin has certain benefits. This is where the confusion starts. How can insulin be harmful and also have health benefits?

**Potential health benefits of insulin:**

• It helps lower blood sugar levels

• It supports muscle growth

• It protects against muscle atrophy

• It supports the arteries

• It helps lower LDL cholesterol

• It helps lower blood pressure

• It lowers the production of glucose in the liver

• It supports the absorption of potassium and magnesium

• It suppresses lipolysis

• It is a potent anti-inflammatory

• It has antioxidant properties

• Insulin nasal spray is used to help people who have dementia

• It helps increases testosterone

• It helps lower uric acid

The real problem is with the insulin receptors. When the receptors become resistant, as in insulin resistance, we lose the function of insulin. When someone has insulin resistance, they actually have an insulin deficiency. You may have excess insulin in your blood, but it’s not affecting the receptors. A high level of insulin is what creates insulin resistance. The more you increase insulin, the less the receptors will work.
