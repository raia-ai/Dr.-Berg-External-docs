# What are effective treatments or strategies for managing vascular calcification and osteoarthritis?

To manage vascular calcification and osteoarthritis, vitamin K2 is essential. It helps prevent calcium deposition in the arteries and works synergistically with vitamin D3 to alleviate arthritis and stiffness. Ensure you follow a healthy keto diet and practice intermittent fasting to reduce oxidative stress. While chelation therapy can be considered, prioritizing vitamin K2 is key.
