# How can I grow taller?

To support height increase and promote growth, consider incorporating the following strategies: Ensure adequate intake of trace minerals, particularly zinc found in foods like red meat and shellfish, or through a quality trace mineral supplement. Pituitrophin PMG (SP) can also aid in supporting growth processes.

Prioritize sufficient sleep, as it plays a crucial role in growth hormone production. Avoid phytates, which can inhibit mineral absorption necessary for bone health and growth. Ensure adequate vitamin D3 through regular sunlight exposure, essential for bone development. Adopting a Healthy Keto diet and intermittent fasting regimen can also support overall health and potentially optimize growth processes.
