# What are some effective remedies or treatments for managing and alleviating symptoms of OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder)?

Common treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder come with potential side effects, so it’s worth talking to your doctor about natural alternatives. OCD is a condition where you have obsessive thoughts or impulses to repeat routines. In my opinion, the best diet for obsessive-compulsive disorder is the Healthy Keto® diet. Intermittent fasting could also be beneficial.

There are also incredible natural remedies for OCD that you can try, along with the keto diet and fasting.

**The best natural remedies for OCD:**

1\. Myo-inositol

2\. NAC

3\. Glycine

4\. L-serine

5\. Thiamine (vitamin B1)

6\. Probiotic foods
