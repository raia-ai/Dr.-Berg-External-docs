# What are the benefits of Keto Fasting Tea?

Dr. Berg’s KetoFast Tea makes losing weight easier. It provides you with natural full-body support and helps fight the distractions that make dieting tough.

Keto and intermittent fasting are some of the best ways to lose weight... but it still isn’t easy. Giving up sugary drinks and not being allowed to eat during big chunks of the day also are tough. This unique blend of herbs keeps your appetite suppressed, fights irritability, and supports normal blood sugars. All so you stay happy as you lose.

Cravings mean that your body thinks it has to eat when it really doesn’t. While this can be because of habit, there are also body-related reasons. This tea supports good health to prevent those cravings from happening.
