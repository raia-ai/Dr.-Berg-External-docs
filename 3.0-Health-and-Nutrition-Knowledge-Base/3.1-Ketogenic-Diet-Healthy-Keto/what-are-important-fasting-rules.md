# What are important fasting rules?

The 7 most important intermittent fasting rules are as follows:

**1\. Hydration is Key**: Drinking water, tea, and coffee while fasting is beneficial. Certain teas can help extend your fast and reduce hunger. Coffee is fine, but avoid excessive consumption.

**2\. Supplement Wisely:** Taking supplements like vitamins, electrolytes, trace minerals, nutritional yeast, and omega-3 fatty acids is important while fasting. A green drink without fiber, like wheatgrass juice powder, is acceptable. Avoid protein powders and branched-chain amino acids. Bone broth or MCT oil can be tried but may not suit everyone.

**3\. Listen to Your Hunger Cues**: Only eat when you're truly hungry. If you reach your fasting goal and feel like you can go longer, it's okay to extend your fast. However, donâ€™t push yourself to the point of weakness, fatigue, irritability, or dizziness.

**4\. Refeed Gradually:** After fasting for 48 hours or more, reintroduce food slowly. Start with a small amount of food and wait before gradually increasing your intake.

**5\. Monitor Insulin Resistance:** Your ability to fast can indicate your insulin resistance level. If fasting is easy, your insulin resistance may be improving. Difficulty fasting may suggest you still have insulin resistance and need more time and effort.

**6\. Combine with Healthy Keto:** Pair intermittent fasting with a healthy keto diet. This combination helps keep insulin levels low and offers numerous health benefits. A high-carb diet could undermine the benefits of intermittent fasting.
