# Keto Zucchini Goat Cheese Rolls

This homemade zucchini goat cheese roll recipe is a great low-carb snack. But, by snack, we mean that you should have them more as a small meal rather than in-between your meals. Zucchini can be pretty bland, but this healthy keto recipe really spices it up. This is a zucchini roll with herb goat cheese and capers. It’s really lovely and delicious. You can make these rolls as small or as large as you want. They also make a really beautiful side dish. 

**ZUCCHINI GOAT CHEESE ROLLS**

**Ingredients:**

- zucchini goat cheese (or your favorite soft cheese)

- Your favorite herbs (or make it easy and buy herb cheese!).

- You can go Italian, with oregano and garlic, or savory, with Thyme and parsley - whatever you like.

- capers

**Directions:**

- Mix herbs into cheese until fully blended.

- Slice zucchini thinly, about 1/8 inch.

- Press slices between two paper towels to pull out extra moisture.

- Grill until tender, or bake at 375 until tender but not mushy for about 15 minutes.

- Cool slightly. Press again between paper towels.

- Spread cheese onto ¾ of zucchini slice.

- Add 2-3 capers to the end with cheese on it. 

- Roll them up! You can put toothpick in them or just rest on a plate and serve.

- The larger/thicker the slices of zucchini, the larger the roll.   

- For small bites (appetizers) you’ll want to keep them thinner. But a larger roll is a gorgeous side, for the dinner plate. 

**Enjoy!**
