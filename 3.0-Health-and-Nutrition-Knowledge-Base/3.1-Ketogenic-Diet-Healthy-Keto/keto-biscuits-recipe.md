# Keto Biscuits Recipe

A lot of people love to have a nice biscuit or piece of bread with butter. While on the ketogenic diet, you can have grass-fed butter, but traditional breads and biscuits are not an option. This is the perfect low-carb alternative if you’re on the keto diet, but you still want to have something that’s like bread or a biscuit. Put grass-fed butter on it or oil with Italian spices. They’re easy and delicious. 

These biscuits are very bread-like, so you could slice it for sandwiches or toast it! Yum! This recipe is for ONE biscuit. But you can easily double it, triple it, etc. - as much as you want and fill as many muffin cups as you like. Make enough, and you can even make a loaf. 

**Keto Biscuits Recipe:**

1 tbl coconut flour

2 tbl ground flaxseed

1 egg

1 tsp Kerrygold butter ½ tsp baking powder

2 grinds (pinches) of salt

**Directions:**

Mix and put in greased ramekins/muffin cups/loaf pan. Bake at 350 for 15 minutes. When using a loaf pan, 25 minutes will be needed. Test with knife or toothpick, to see to it that it comes out clean and to ensure doneness.

Enjoy!
