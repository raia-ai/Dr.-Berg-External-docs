# What steps should I take if I've plateaued on a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting?

The primary objective is to manage insulin levels effectively while promoting a healthy metabolic state. To achieve this, consider the following strategies:

1. **Avoid Snacking**: Eliminate snacks throughout the day to maintain stable insulin levels.

2. **Adopt a Two-Meal Structure**: Limit your meals to twice a day, ensuring they are sufficiently high in healthy fats. This will help sustain satiety between meals and support metabolic function.

Implementing these changes may help you overcome the plateau and enhance your overall progress on a ketogenic diet combined with intermittent fasting.
