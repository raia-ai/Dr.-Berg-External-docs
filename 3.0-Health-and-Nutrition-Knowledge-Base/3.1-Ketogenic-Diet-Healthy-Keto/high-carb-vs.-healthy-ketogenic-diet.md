# High-Carb Vs. Healthy Ketogenic Diet

## **High-Carb Vs. Healthy Ketogenic Diets**

A diet abundant in refined carbs can lead to a heightened need for vitamins B1 and C. This is because refining strips away much of their nutritional value, leaving you with empty calories that do little to nourish your body.

### **Why Does Consuming Refined Carbs Increase Our Need For Vitamins?**

The more processed carbohydrates you take in, the harder your body has to work to break them down. This increased metabolic activity requires additional nutrients for support - hence the heightened need for vitamins such as B1 (thiamine) and C (ascorbic acid).

Thiamine is crucial in converting food into energy, while ascorbic acid helps protect cells from damage.

### **Transitioning From Carb-heavy Meals To Balanced Ketogenic Plates**

A healthy ketogenic lifestyle is a diet focused on low-carb, high-fat foods that promote balanced nutrition without overloading your system with unnecessary sugars.

By reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with healthy fats, the keto diet puts your body into a metabolic state known as ketosis, where fat becomes its primary fuel source instead of glucose derived from carbohydrates.

This helps maintain steady blood sugar levels and reduces insulin resistance, promoting better nutrient absorption. To make transitioning easier, gradually reduce your carb intake while increasing healthy fats.

[Incorporate healthy fats into your diet](https://www.drberg.com/ketosis-approved-foods), such as avocados, nuts/seeds, and fatty fish, and include plenty of green leafy vegetables.

## **Conclusion**

Healthy Keto is excellent for weight loss and promotes overall health. A high-fat diet can lower the risk of insulin resistance, help balance hormonal levels, and promote digestive health.
