# Is there a Keto mayonnaise?

This will help if you're not sure what to eat on keto, or if you're looking for ingredients to include in some great keto-friendly recipes. This week, we have Sir Kensington's mayonnaise. I have no affiliation with this company—I just think it's a great company. I like to use Sir Kensington’s mayonnaise and mustard on my hamburgers. 

Many of the other types of mayonnaise out there contain soy oil which is GMO.
