# Can I have beets on Keto?

Yes, beets are keto-friendly. Beets are low in net carbs, high in dietary fiber, and a highly nutritious vegetable that you can regularly incorporate into your keto menu plan.

While beets are an excellent keto-approved food, itâ€™s best to avoid drinking beetroot juice. Beet juice is high in carbs, contains no dietary fiber, and can quickly push you out of ketosis.
