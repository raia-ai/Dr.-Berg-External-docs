# What are the potential therapeutic benefits of vitamin E supplementation in the context of hepatic health and liver disease management?

There is a condition called NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), which is basically a fatty liver that has some inflammation. There have been many studies on using vitamin E for NASH.

Vitamin E has demonstrated significant improvement in:

1\. Steatosis (the fatty liver portion)

2\. Inflammation

3\. Ballooning of the liver cells (degeneration)

Essentially, vitamin E may have the power to reduce the fat, inflammation, and the death of the liver cells in adult patients with NASH that don’t have diabetes or cirrhosis. In one study, they used a natural version of only one part of the vitamin E complex. However, it may be beneficial to have the whole complex. They also used 800 IUs of this one part. Other studies have used up to 1000 IUs, while others only used 400 IUs. Between 800 and 1000 IUs may be the best idea.

Vitamin E may help stop the transition of going from having a fatty liver to an inflamed liver. It’s a very powerful antioxidant that may help calm free radicle damage, prevent inflammation, and prevent fibrosis.

Taking vitamin E alone may not change anything very much. But, changing the diet as well may make a more significant difference. The healthy keto diet with intermittent fasting may be the best way to go. Adding vitamin C in a food complex with choline may also be beneficial.
