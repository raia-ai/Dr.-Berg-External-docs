# What can I eat for breakfast on keto?

You can consume bacon and eggs, or many other foods, as your first meal of the day. But it’s not recommended that you have a morning meal, because it will cause you to lose the benefits of the morning fasting time added to your fast during the night. Try to push your first meal to a little later in the day – even to noon or early afternoon.

Ideally, you would combine a ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting, to get the most benefits for health and weight loss.
