# What can I do if I'm extremely hungry on Intermittent Fasting?

1\. Go slower and gradually ease into it.

2\. Increase fat in the meal or increase more protein.

3\. Decrease carbs (20-50g/day). If your carbs are too high, you'll never get into ketosis.

4\. Increase your vegetable intake (7-10 cups) to get your potassium and magnesium.

5\. Add apple cider vinegar to your meals.

6\. If you have to snack, consume fat as your snack.

**It takes 4-5 days to start getting into ketosis.**
