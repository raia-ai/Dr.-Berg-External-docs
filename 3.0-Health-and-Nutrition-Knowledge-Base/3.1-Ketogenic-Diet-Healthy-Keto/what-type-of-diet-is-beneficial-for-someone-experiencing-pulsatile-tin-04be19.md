# What type of diet is beneficial for someone experiencing pulsatile tinnitus, and how might dietary choices impact symptoms and overall management?

Pulsatile tinnitus may be linked to potassium deficiency, often exacerbated by a ketogenic diet due to water and glycogen loss. To address this, ensure adequate potassium intake—about 4,700 mg daily—by incorporating potassium-rich foods like meats and salads. Additionally, complement your diet with B vitamins and electrolytes to support overall health and alleviate symptoms.
