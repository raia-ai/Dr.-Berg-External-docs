# Keto Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe

It’s hard to make chocolate chip cookies that taste good and are still keto-friendly and low carb. Getting the consistency right can be tricky. But, we’ve done it. 

This is a really easy recipe that we actually got off of the almond flour bag we bought, and Karen Berg just changed it a tiny bit. Almond flour is so easy to get, and it’s an excellent flour alternative. Instead of using brown sugar, Karen uses white powder sweetener with a tiny touch of molasses. 

Enjoy these cookies with a meal.  

**How to make Dr. Berg-approved Chocolate Chip Cookies**

**Ingredients:**

½ cup butter, stored under room temperature

¼ cup sugar substitute (I use Just Like Sugar.)

¼ cup brown sugar (as a sugar-free substitute.

I use ¼ cup of Just Like Sugar PLUS 1 tsp of Black Strap Molasses.)

1 tsp vanilla

1 egg, plus

1 egg white

2 ½ cups almond flour

1 ¼ cup sugar-free chocolate chips (I use King Arthur’s brand.)

½ tsp baking soda

¼ tsp salt

**Directions:**

In a medium bowl, mix all wet ingredients and beat until creamy.

In a larger bowl, mix all dry ingredients.

Add water to dry and mix well, into a dough. Make into balls (Choose the size!). Press slightly using your palm, as these do not spread as they bake. But don’t make them too thin, as they have a GREAT consistency when they are about ½ inch thick.

Bake at 350 for about 13-15 minutes, and get slightly brown on top. Do not overbake. 

If necessary, take out one early and let it cool to check consistency. You can always put the cookies back in for a minute to firm them up. Ovens cook differently, so I go for a shorter time and test, and pop back in the oven if I need to.

Enjoy!
