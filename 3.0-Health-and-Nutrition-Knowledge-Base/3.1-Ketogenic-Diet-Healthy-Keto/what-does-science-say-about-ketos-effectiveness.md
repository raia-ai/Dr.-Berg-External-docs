# What does science say about Ketoâ€™s effectiveness?

Science confirms keto is a highly effective tool for preventing or managing insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity, elevated cholesterol, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and PCOS. 

Research also suggests that a high-fat diet reduces hunger and cravings, which makes the keto diet a sustainable long-term tool to improve health, maintain a healthy weight, lower the risk of chronic diseases, and potentially increase longevity.
