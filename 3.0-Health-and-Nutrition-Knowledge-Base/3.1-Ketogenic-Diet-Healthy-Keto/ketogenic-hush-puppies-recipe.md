# Ketogenic Hush Puppies Recipe

A lot of people on the ketogenic diet have this idea that you have to give up a lot of your favorite foods. But, what they may not know is that a lot of your favorite foods cab become keto-friendly foods with just a few adjustments—this the case for these delicious ketogenic hush puppies. 

For this recipe, I salted the tops of the hush puppies at the very end with sea salt to give them a little something extra. But, salt is actually very important for your health. This can be a great salty alternative to chips and other unhealthy salty foods. If you’re on keto, it’s important to consume 1 tsp. of sea salt per day. If you don’t, you will have more cravings for chips and those other unhealthy salty foods. Always use sea salt.
