# What are top foods to lose belly fat?

Cortisol, a stress hormone, converts protein into sugar, prompting the liver to produce sugar from non-carbohydrate sources like fat, ketones, and protein. High cortisol levels lead to increased sugar production, which elevates insulin, and in turn, contributes to belly fat. Consuming a high-carb diet, sugar, or eating frequently also spikes insulin, leading to belly fat.

Belly fat typically appears after the liver becomes fatty, as visceral fat around the organs often results from fat spill-off from the liver. Therefore, the best foods to reduce belly fat are those that lower insulin, decrease cortisol, or support liver health.

Ten foods that help reduce belly fat:

1\. Eggs

2\. Salmon

3\. Cod liver and cod liver oil

4\. Sauerkraut

5\. Cruciferous vegetables

6\. Hamburger

7\. Avocados

8\. Broccoli sprouts

9\. Asparagus

10\. Nutritional yeast (non-fortified)
