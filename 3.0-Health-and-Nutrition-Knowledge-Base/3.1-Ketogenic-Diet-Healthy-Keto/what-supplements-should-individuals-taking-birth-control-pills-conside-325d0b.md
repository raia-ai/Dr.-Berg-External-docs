# What supplements should individuals taking birth control pills consider incorporating into their regimen?

Birth control pills can lead to nutrient depletion and may contribute to issues related to bile production. Itâ€™s not always necessary to take additional vitamins while on birth control; instead, consider assessing your overall nutrient status. If you follow a healthy version of the ketogenic diet, you are likely obtaining adequate nutrition.

However, one concern associated with birth control pills is their potential impact on gallbladder function, which can impair the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E, K1, and K2. It may be beneficial to monitor your nutrient levels and consider targeted supplementation if deficiencies are identified.
