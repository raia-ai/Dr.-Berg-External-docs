# I'm addicted to sugar but I feel great when I'm on Keto. I want to lose weight - any word of advice?

Now we have to pretend that sugar is scarce. And so you have to do all sorts of things from not buying it, you know, cleaning out your sugar from your house. In fact, I think that would be a really good thing to do.

Go through all your cupboards, your refrigerator and remove all the sugar, get it out because, that late night when you're craving and you're going to your fridge and you're debating whether you're going to drive to the store or not, but you got to drive. So that will discourage you.

But the other thing too, is that once you get off sugar, okay, it might take a week or two, but then you're going to adapt to fat burning and your cravings will go away unless you eat them again.

And the other thing too is just the attitude of being in charge of your body. Because your body will give you all sorts of crazy messages like I want that donut over there.
