# Why do I have a dry mouth on keto?

Adults produce 0.5 to 1.5 liters (2 to 6 cups) of saliva daily. On keto, without starches and sugars, the need for amylase and saliva decreases. Additionally, keto increases the need for electrolytes, especially potassium and magnesium.

Reducing carbs often leads to fewer vegetable intake, causing a mineral deficiency. Consuming 7 to 10 cups of salad daily provides the necessary potassium (4,700 mg). Healthy KetoÂ® emphasizes vegetable intake to maintain electrolyte balance.

To prevent dry mouth on keto, increase vegetable consumption, use a good electrolyte powder, and add Himalayan sea salt for better hydration.
