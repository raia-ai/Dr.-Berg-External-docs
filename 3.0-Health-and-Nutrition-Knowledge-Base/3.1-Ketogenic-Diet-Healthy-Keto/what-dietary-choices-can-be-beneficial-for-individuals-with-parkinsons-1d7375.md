# What dietary choices can be beneficial for individuals with Parkinson’s disease?

There are proteins in the brain that can protect it against the oxidation that can lead to degenerative diseases. But there is also a protein in the brain that inhibits these protective proteins. Fortunately a compound called farnesol can deactivate the protein that inhibits the protective proteins. This allows the protective proteins to help prevent or slow down Parkinson’s disease and other degenerative diseases. Farnesol is in certain types of foods.

The best foods containing farnesol for Parkinson’s disease:

- Berries

- Vegetables (especially tomatoes, which are OK in moderate amounts on keto)

- Herbs (lemongrass, chamomile, rose and musk)

- Essential oils (citronella)
