# What should I do if I'm experiencing hunger and frequent cravings?

Many people worry about cravings when starting a ketogenic diet, but both keto and intermittent fasting can help eliminate them.

High insulin levels lower blood sugar, leading to cravings. Reducing insulin through a low-carb diet is key, as carbs trigger insulin release. While protein can also spike insulin if consumed excessively, itâ€™s important to keep protein intake moderate. Increasing fat consumption is crucial, as fat does not affect insulin, and including plenty of vegetables is beneficial.

The transition from sugar-burning to fat-burning may come with cravings, often lasting about three days. To speed up this process, use electrolyte powder, B vitamins from nutritional yeast, and apple cider vinegar with meals.

If you still feel hungry despite following a low-carb diet, consider these factors:

\- Not practicing intermittent fasting

\- Consuming hidden carbs

\- Low dietary fat

\- Insufficient adaptation time

\- Eating low-nutrient foods

\- Insulin resistance

\- Low bile production

Addressing these issues can help manage cravings and improve your success on keto.
