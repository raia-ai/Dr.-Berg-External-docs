**Sugar-free Chewy Ginger Cookies Recipe:**

**Ingredients:**

2 ½ cup almond flour

½ cup sugar substitute (Just Like Sugar™)

½ tsp cinnamon

½ nutmeg

2 tsp ginger

¼ tsp salt

6 tbsp butter, stored under room temperature

3 tbsp FiberYum liquid sweetener (or similar – NOT honey or agave)

2 tablespoons water

1 tsp black strap molasses

1 egg (organic, pasture-raised)

**Directions:**

In a medium bowl, mix wet ingredients with a hand beater until well-blended.

In a larger bowl, mix dry ingredients.

Pour wet mix into the dry and mix well.

Using a spatula, pull all dough into the middle of the bowl and chill for about an hour so it would be easy to handle. 

When chilled, roll into balls of any size.

I use a cookie-baller and overfill a bit.

Bake for 10 minutes or until the edges start to brown.

They will be soft when you take them out.

Cool on a wire rack.
