# What are the potential reasons for sugar cravings, and how do factors such as hormonal fluctuations, emotional triggers, and dietary habits contribute to this desire?

Craving sugar is a very common problem, especially if you are trying to get onto a healthy diet. It can be caused by several underlying issues. Let’s break it down and look at some simple remedies to the problem.

**Cause #1: High-carb diet**

When you are on a high-carb diet your body will produce insulin (fat-storing hormone) to lower the blood sugar spikes. High blood sugar will make you feel satisfied after the high-sugar / high- carb meal. However, a few hours later, the insulin will drop the blood sugar too low, causing you to crave these foods again. The cycle repeats.

Additionally, consuming refined carbs and sugar increases the hormones and chemicals in the body that are related to pleasure, making you feel satisfied when you are consume them.

A high-carb diet is very addictive, with many side effects.

The solution is to get on the Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting. When you start following them, in a few days your body will adapt to a new healthy type of fuel: ketones (instead of sugar).

Ketones are a byproduct of your body burning its own fat. If your body is adapted to ketones you will feel much more energetic, less stressed, healthier, and you will have no cravings or hunger whatsoever. As an additional reward, you will burn fat.

**Cause #2: Snacking**

Eating between meals, even if it’s not much food, will raise your level of insulin. This is because eating in general will raise insulin. Insulin in turn will lower your blood sugar levels, and shortly after your snack you will feel hunger and cravings again.

**Cause #3: Stress**

When you are undergoing stress, you may feel like eating sweets and carbohydrates. This usually has its roots in being accustomed to a high-carb diet. When you eat carbs out of stress, you may feel satisfied temporarily, because your blood sugar and dopamine (pleasure-related chemical produced by your body) go high. Shortly after, when they drop, you will feel stressed again and will crave carbs to feel better. The solution would be to get on the right diet and get your stress levels under control.

Additionally, if you constantly undergo stress, your stress hormone, called cortisol, is going to break down your body proteins and turn them into sugar. This will spike your blood sugar and make your body produce insulin to lower it. Once blood sugar is lowered below the normal level, you will crave sugar and carbs.
