# How can I do a vegetarian version of the keto diet?

A vegetarian keto diet is achievable with careful planning. Key nutrients like zinc, vitamin A (retinol), B12, and DHA are challenging but can be sourced from specific foods:

1\. **Zinc and Vitamin A**: Focus on beta-carotene-rich vegetables, though retinol may require supplementation.

2\. **B12**: Consider fortified foods or supplements.

3\. **DHA and Omega-3**: Obtain from algae or spirulina.

For protein, combine sources like:

\- Spirulina

\- Nuts (e.g., walnuts)

\- Sprouted legumes

\- Organic tofu or tempeh

Keep net carbs under 50 grams per day by avoiding grains and focusing on low-carb vegetables and protein sources. With careful planning, a vegetarian keto diet can be both nutritious and effective.
