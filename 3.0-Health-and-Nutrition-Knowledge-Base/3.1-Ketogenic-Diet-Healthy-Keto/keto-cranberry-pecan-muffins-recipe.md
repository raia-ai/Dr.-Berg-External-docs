# Keto Cranberry Pecan Muffins Recipe

These low-carb cranberry pecan muffins are amazing, and they are completely keto-friendly. There is no regular flour or sugar in this recipe. I like to use Kerrygold grass-fed butter on top. Even my kids love these delicious muffins, and I think you're going to love them too. 

The cranberries in this recipe are ok because cranberries are tart, they don't have a lot of sugar. You're also allowed between 20 and 50 grams of carbs per day with a ketogenic diet. You don't have to feel deprived on the ketogenic diet. Great recipes like this one are delicious and will even make the house smell great!

**Cranberry Pecan Muffins Recipe**

**Ingredients**

• ½ cup sour cream

• 4 large organic, pasture-raised eggs

• 1 tsp vanilla

• 3 cups almond flour

• ½ tsp cinnamon

• 2 tsp baking powder (aluminum-free)

• ½ cup sugar-free sweetener (I use Just Like Sugar)

• ¼ tsp salt

• 1 cup fresh or frozen/thawed cranberries (If frozen, they must be fully thawed and drained.)

• ½ cup pecans (nuts are optional)

**Directions**

1\. Preheat oven at 325°F. 

2\. Line the muffin tin with cups or use silicone liners.

3\. In a blender, mix sour cream, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, baking powder, sweetener, and salt. Blend until well-mixed. 

4\. Add almond flour mixture a bit at a time and blend. If it gets too thick, add water until it can blend into a batter. Mix well.

5\. Add cranberries and nuts and mix with a spatula. (If it's easier for you, you can pour the batter into a large bowl or mix the whole thing in a bowl. You'll still end up with yummy cranberry muffins.) 

6\. Using a ¼ cup or a spoon, pour the batter into the muffin cups, dividing the batter evenly into 12. 

7\. Bake for 25-30 minutes until the muffins are slightly brown and firm to touch. Let them cool at room temperature because warm muffins will stick to the paper.
