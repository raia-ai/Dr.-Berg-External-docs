# Keto Chocolate Seed Treat

Nuts are heavy on the gallbladder. So, I wanted to make a healthy treat that had a low amount of chocolate, and I didnâ€™t want to use nuts. So, I used seeds instead. I used sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds.  Both sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds are packed with protein, fiber, healthy fats, and vitamins.

**Only eat these with a meal, NOT between meals.**  

**RECIPE:**

5 cups of seeds.

Use 2 1/2 cups of roasted salted sunflower seeds and 2 1/2 cups of roasted salted pumpkin seeds.

9 ounces of Lily's chocolate chips. You could use Simply Lite Chocolate (3 bars) with maltitol but it can create more digestive gas for some people.

1-3 tbs of coconut oil.

1 tsp of vanilla extract.

Sea salt (pinch) if your seeds are not salted

**Directions:**

Melt chocolate and coconut oil

Mix in chocolate and oil to seed mix 

Add vanilla extract and salt if needed

Spread over a tray with parchment paper

Put in freezer for 15 minutes to 1 hour

**Enjoy!**
