# Is tuna good to consume on Keto?

Yes you can. Some types of tuna are good to consume, and certain types are bad. The “bad” types contain excessive amounts of mercury – 3 times as much as the “good” tuna varieties contain. Mercury interferes with certain enzymes involving selenium.

Some fish have more selenium than others. The mercury in the environment that the fish are exposed to might not affect you too much if the fish is high in selenium. This is because selenium can counter mercury. But if there is too much mercury in the fish, it can lock up the selenium enzymes, making them inactive.

This can create a lot of different symptoms, including:

- Tremors

- Headaches

- Nausea

- Insomnia

- Muscle weakness

- Twitches

- Mood swings

    Types of tuna that have lower amounts of mercury:

- Skipjack tuna

- Canned light tuna

    Types of tuna that have high amounts of mercury:

- Albacore tuna (canned white tuna)

- Ahi tuna (yellowfin tuna and bigeye tuna)
