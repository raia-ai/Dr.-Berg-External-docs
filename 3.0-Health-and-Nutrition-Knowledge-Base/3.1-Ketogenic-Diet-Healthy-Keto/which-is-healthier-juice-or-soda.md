# Which is healthier: Juice or Soda?

While fruit juice seems like a healthy choice due to its natural origin, it's surprisingly similar to soda in sugar content. A 12-ounce serving of juice often packs more sugar than the same amount of soda!

Juice production strips away the beneficial fiber and oils found in whole fruit, leaving behind a highly refined product. Artificial flavors are often added, and the pasteurization process destroys valuable nutrients and beneficial microbes.

Non-organic juices may also contain pesticide residues. Moreover, the high sugar content in juice, without the accompanying vitamins and minerals, forces your body to deplete its nutrient stores.

Even popular apple juice is often made from concentrate, stored for long periods, and shipped globally before being reconstituted.

In the end, both soda and juice are unhealthy choices. If you're craving juice, opt for the whole fruit instead.

A better alternative is a fruit smoothie, which retains live enzymes, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants without pasteurization. For a soda fix, consider sugar-free options like Zevia, or simply enjoy refreshing water with electrolytes.
