# What is rheumatoid arthritis, and what are the common symptoms associated with this autoimmune condition?

**Rheumatoid Arthritis**

Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease causing joint pain on both sides of the body due to immune system attacks on healthy cells.

**Microbial Connection**

Studies link knee rheumatoid arthritis to bacteria like porphyromonas gingivalis found in knee and heart joints.

**Natural Antibiotics**

Test with natural antibiotics like goldenseal, tea tree oil, myrrh, garlic, thyme, oregano oil, and olive leaf extract to check if microbes are the cause.

**Supporting Immune System**

Boost immune health and reduce inflammation with vitamin D (20,000-60,000 IU/day), vitamin K2 (300 mcg/day), zinc (200 mg 3x/day for 1-2 weeks), Healthy KetoÂ® diet, intermittent fasting, potassium (6,000 mg/day), ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, omega-3 fatty acids, ozone therapy, and thunder god vine (570 mg).
