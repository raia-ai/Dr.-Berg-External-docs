# How to choose protein correctly on Keto?

In nature, protein never comes as a complete protein—it comes with fat. There is something called the insulin index, which looks at the protein effect on insulin. The leaner the protein, the higher the spike in insulin. You would want to consume fattier proteins and avoid lean proteins to get into deeper ketosis.

The calories in your keto diet should consist of about 10% carbs (5% of your carbs should be from vegetables), 20% protein, and 70% fat. This is about 3.5 times more fat than protein. But, really, we have to look at the weight because there is more condensed energy in fat than protein. Now, we’re looking at 1.56g of fat and 1g of protein. Having a higher fat to protein ratio can have many benefits.
