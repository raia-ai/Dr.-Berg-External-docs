# Intermittent Fasting

## Achieving Success with Periodic Fasting

### **Achieving Success with Periodic Fasting**

To truly harness periodic fasting's potential for improving health and managing chronic conditions, it's essential to approach it with the right strategies and mindset.

You can minimize side effects and optimize your results by focusing on consistency, gradual adaptation, and a balanced approach.

#### **Transitioning Smoothly into Fasting**

One of the best ways to start intermittent fasting is to ease into it gradually. Begin by reducing your eating window by an hour or two each day until you reach your desired fasting schedule.

This allows your body to adapt more comfortably to the changes in nutrient intake and can help minimize the severity of any side effects during the adaptation period.

It's also important to focus on nutrient-dense, whole foods during your eating windows to ensure your body is getting the essential vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients it needs to function optimally.

Staying hydrated and prioritizing sleep can further support your body's adaptation to fasting and help you feel your best.

#### **Optimizing Health Outcomes Through Fasting**

When done correctly, periodic fasting can offer a range of health benefits, including improved insulin sensitivity, better blood sugar control, reduced inflammation, and [enhanced cognitive function](https://www.drberg.com/blog/enhance-cognitive-function-and-mood-on-healthy-ketosis).

Maintaining a consistent fasting routine and focusing on healthy lifestyle habits can optimize these outcomes and support your overall well-being.

It's important to remember that fasting is just one piece of the health puzzle. Combining intermittent fasting with a proper diet, regular physical activity, stress management, and adequate sleep can help you achieve and maintain optimal health in the long run.

As with any new health practice, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before starting a fasting regimen, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or concerns.

With the right approach and guidance, periodic fasting can be a powerful tool for transforming your health and quality of life.

### **Intermittent Insight**

Provide a comprehensive view of the potential drawbacks associated with periodic fasting, mainly focusing on the [18:6 fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/dramatically-spike-brainpower-with-an-18-hour-fast) approach. While intermittent fasting can offer numerous health benefits, it's important to understand and address potential challenges.

Drawbacks may include initial hunger or discomfort during fasting periods, difficulty with adherence to a restricted eating window, and potential disruptions to social eating patterns.

Additionally, some individuals may experience fluctuations in energy levels or difficulty maintaining muscle mass with prolonged fasting.

By acknowledging these drawbacks and finding personalized strategies to mitigate them, individuals can make informed decisions about incorporating intermittent fasting into their lifestyle while maximizing its potential benefits.

## Am I still getting the benefits of intermittent fasting if I drink coffee with some milk in the morning?

The impact of adding some milk to your morning coffee while intermittent fasting depends largely on the calorie content. A small amount is unlikely to significantly disrupt your fasting benefits. The key is to avoid excessive calories that could affect insulin levels. To maximize the benefits of intermittent fasting, it's also important to avoid snacking during your eating window. This helps maintain a lower insulin response and enhances the overall effectiveness of your fasting regimen.

## Are high ketones during fasting dangerous?

Ketoacidosis is a serious health concern that can have devastating health consequences. However, having ketones in the blood during a fast is rarely cause for alarm. In fact, it is often an indicator that your body is burning fat.

Ketoacidosis primarily happens to diabetics who don’t take the right amount of insulin. Ketoacidosis is very different from nutritional ketosis, which is beneficial and will result in ketone levels in the body being raised.

## Are there any danger sides of fasting?

[Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz\&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do _not_ encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provide this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast. If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

Most of the dangers of fasting I’m going to cover aren’t related to a 16 to 18-hour fast. This applies more to prolonged fasting, which is when a person fasts for 48 to 72 hours—or even longer. The purpose of eating is not just to get fuel. It’s also to get nutrients. When you’re fasting, you’re restricting nutrients. If your diet isn’t providing you with the nutrients you need when you do eat, you could end up with deficiencies that lead to certain issues. **It’s crucial to do a prolonged fast correctly and avoid common mistakes related to the dark side of fasting.**

**The dark side of prolonged fasting:**

1\. Refeeding syndrome When you come off of a fast, have a small amount of food, wait a couple of hours, and have a little bit more. Avoid overeating or eating carbs.

2\. Dirty keto Make sure you consume nutrient-dense, high-quality foods on the keto diet.

3\. Not taking nutrients while fasting At the bare minimum, you need to take electrolytes, sea salt, trace minerals, and B vitamins while fasting.

4\. Kidney stones Avoid high-oxalate foods if you’re prone to kidney stones. Also, consume at least two and a half liters of fluid a day, and add lemon juice to your water. When you’re back to having meals, consume large salads.

5\. Anorexia Anorexia will cause nutritional deficiencies. Instead of fasting, get on the keto diet.

6\. Athletes that have not adapted to fat yet Give your body enough time to become fully fat-adapted before attempting prolonged fasting.

7\. Fasting for children Fasting isn’t a good idea for children. Eating three meals a day and cutting out snacking may be beneficial for children. Teenagers who are overweight may consider two meals a day without snacking.

8\. Not getting enough nutrition while pregnant or lactating Not getting enough nutrients while pregnant or lactating can lead to issues for the mother and child. Choosing a whole-food, natural prenatal vitamin over a synthetic prenatal vitamin is also important.

9\. Muscle loss If you’re older and noticing muscle loss, try adding a blend of amino acids to your diet.

10\. Ketoacidosis This rare condition occurs in people under very specific circumstances and isn't something most people should be concerned about.

## Are there any negative aspects of intermittent fasting?

Intermittent fasting is very beneficial for people who are able to successfully implement it. It can lead to weight less, cell regeneration, less unhealthy cravings, better blood sugar control and much more.

While most people will gain great benefits from adopting intermittent fasting, women that are pregnant or breastfeeding should not adopt this eating pattern, as they require a higher level of nutrient intake. In addition, those with a history of eating disorders should not try intermittent fasting as it could trigger harmful tendencies. Aside from these groups, intermittent fasting is a transformative way of eating that can improve anyone's health and well-being.

## Can a 16-Hour fast start autophagy?

Yes, inducing autophagy may be possible with a 16-hour fast, especially for those following a low-carb ketogenic diet.

Depleting blood sugar and glycogen stores is key for activating autophagy, which explains why consuming a low-carb diet can help promote autophagy.

## Can a frail senior parent do Intermittent Fasting?

**CONS**

• If your parent is thin, you don’t want them to lose weight

**PROS**

• Neurogenesis

• Increase Stem Cells

• Extend Life

Do a version of intermittent fasting that doesn’t restrict the calories. Calculate the calories and push them into two meals or less frequently without reducing the calories. Make sure that the fat is high enough to prevent weight loss.

The key is to keep their calorie intake high which also means to keep the fat higher. Add fermented vegetables because it is very important for the elderly to start establishing the flora and getting the pH correct. Vitamin K2 is vital as well because it helps remove calcification as we age. It also improves and strengthens the output of the mitochondria.

**Recommended K2:** 100mg – 10,000IUs of vitamin D (MK7 version)

**Stomach Support:** Betaine Hydrochloride or Apple Cider Vinegar

## Can brushing your teeth break a fast?

It's not going to break your fast. I wouldn't worry about it. Unless you're swallowing all that toothpaste, which probably not.

***

## Can fasting help with a keloid?

Fasting may help with keloid scars by promoting overall skin health and reducing inflammation. To enhance results, consider applying high-quality vitamin E oil to the keloid, as it can aid in breaking down scar tissue. Additionally, the enzyme serrapeptase may help reduce scarring and fibrosis. However, individual results can vary, so it's advisable to research these options further and consult with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

***

## Can fasting help with diabetes?

Yes, fasting is an excellent strategy to manage diabetes. During fasting periods, the body is forced to utilize stored body fats instead of sugars to generate energy. This promotes weight loss, keeps blood sugar levels balanced, and can increase insulin sensitivity, all crucial aspects for effective diabetes management.

If you are considering fasting, we recommend that you do so under the guidance of a Healthcare professional.

***

## Can fasting hinder growth in young children?

If you're five years old probably don't do fasting very much but the type of fasting that I would recommend for children would be just three meals a day. No snacks.That's what I would recommend and make sure it's nutrient dense.

***

## Can fasting mess with a woman’s hormones?

Fasting can actually promote a sense of calm and reduce stress, as it often leads to a state of increased tolerance and serenity. Some concerns arise from the temporary increase in cortisol levels, a counter-regulatory hormone, when blood sugar levels drop due to not eating. However, this is typically not an issue once the body adapts to fasting and enters ketosis, usually within two to three days. At this point, the body efficiently runs on fat as fuel instead of relying solely on blood sugar, stabilizing cortisol levels. The key is to adapt to a ketogenic diet, which helps maintain hormonal balance during fasting.

***

## Can I do 5 days of fasting and on the weekends eat whatever I want?

Here are two reasons why this is not recommended:

* You are not going to adapt to a full state of ketosis.
* This provides no standard for what to eat.

Recommendation: do intermittent fasting every single day and do it correctly – start with 16:8 daily, then if you are comfortable with the ratio, start shortening the eating window a little bit at a time to notice better results.

***

## Can I do ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting if I'm underweight?

The answer is keto and IF is not just good for weight loss, but for anti-aging, inflammation, cognitive health, mood, and the list go on and on. If you don't need to lose weight, just add more fat to your meals. This will stop the weight loss, so your body will burn the dietary fats and not your own fat.

***

## Can I eat kale chips while fasting?

While you can eat kale chips, consuming them during a fasting period may inhibit the benefits of fasting. It's generally best to reserve such snacks for your eating window to maximize the effects of your fast.

***

## Can I eat tofu when I am fasting?

Dr. Berg does not recommend it as it is a soy product. Although tofu is fermented, which buffers some of the bad effects, lots of the soy products in the market are GMO. Soy can create a lot of inflammation and other issues in the body.

***

## Can I fast for more than 24 hours?

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do _not_ encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provides this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast. If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

[Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz\&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

If you fast longer than 24 hours, you need to know HOW to do it healthily and not do it without the electrolytes and other nutrients built up as a reserve.

In this video, Dr. Berg talks about how long you need to fast for.

## Can Intermittent Fasting help reverse a fatty liver?

Fasting is one of the most important things you can do if you have a fatty liver. One way to know if you have a fatty liver is to simply look down at your stomach. If your stomach bulges out, chances are you have a fatty liver. You can also get a biopsy or an ultrasound to be sure. When the liver becomes filled with fat, it spills off into areas around and inside the organs. This is why people start developing a gut.

What causes fatty liver?

**• Sugar or refined carbohydrates**

When you consume glucose, your whole body can deal with it. But, when you consume fructose, the liver is stuck dealing with it. Indirectly your insulin will spike, and other problems with occur. The effects of fructose on the liver are very similar to the effects of alcohol on the liver.

**A few sources of fructose you might not have thought of:**

• High fructose corn syrup

• Fruit juice

• Agave

**The best way to handle a fatty liver is to reverse the flow. You have to fast. You want to work up to about 20 hours of fasting—23 hours would be even better. Don’t eat unless you’re hungry and go for as long as you can.**

**A few more things to help speed up the process:**

• Take choline (and B vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast)

• Exercise

• Bile salts

## Can intermittent fasting help with psoriasis?

Yes, intermittent fasting can help with psoriasis. Here are some key points from Dr. Berg's recommendations:

* **Reducing Inflammation**: Intermittent fasting has been shown to reduce inflammation in the body, which is a key factor in many chronic diseases, including psoriasis. By giving your digestive system a break and allowing your body to focus on repair and regeneration, you can help calm the inflammatory response and promote overall healing.
* **Cell Regeneration**: During fasting periods, the body undergoes a process of cell regeneration, which can help strengthen the immune response. This process is beneficial for skin health as it helps remove damaged cells and promotes the growth of new, healthier cells.
* **Hormonal Balance**: Intermittent fasting can help regulate insulin levels and increase growth hormone levels. This hormonal change triggers autophagy, a cellular cleanup operation that eliminates accumulated cell debris, which could otherwise trigger skin issues like psoriasis.
* **Immune System Enhancement**: Fasting has been shown to enhance immune function by stimulating the production of white blood cells and antibodies, helping your body fight off infections and diseases more effectively. A stronger immune system can better manage autoimmune conditions like psoriasis.

By incorporating intermittent fasting into your routine, you may experience improvements in psoriasis symptoms due to reduced inflammation, enhanced cell regeneration, and a stronger immune system. Always consult with your healthcare provider before making significant changes to your diet or fasting regimen.

## Can intermittent fasting reverse a poor age-related memory loss?

**Age-related memory loss is not normal.** You can improve memory loss, and if it’s not too far gone, you may even be able to reverse poor memory. The key to getting memory, focus, and concentration back is to understand the basic problem and the different factors that relate to it.

Certain areas in the brain make insulin. These areas are also the same areas that are involved with memory problems that are related to diseases like Alzheimer’s.

**Areas of the brain that make insulin:**

• Hippocampus – memory, and learning

• Prefrontal Cortex — short term memory, planning, decision making, goals, differentiating good and bad, trivial vs. important, consequences, selective attention

• Olfactory Bulb – Sense of smell

If there’s too much insulin, the body protects itself by developing insulin resistance around the blood-brain barrier. After that, the body may start to develop amyloid plaques. Amyloid plaque is a type of protein that sticks together, making the protein unusable and difficult to leave the body.

**Fasting is one of the most powerful things you can do to avoid amyloid plaques. Starting at 16 hours of fasting, the body starts the process of autophagy (the body starts eating up damaged and misfolded proteins that turn into amyloid plaque).**

**Action steps for those with Alzheimer’s disease or memory loss signs:**

• Get on healthy keto

• Start fasting

• Take MCT oil

• Take exogenous ketones

***

## Can my intermittent fasting window be flexible?

Yes, your intermittent fasting window can be flexible. It's beneficial to adjust it and see what works best for you. For instance, you might try shifting your eating times—perhaps starting with a first meal earlier in the day and finishing with a second meal by mid-afternoon. Experimenting with different schedules can help you find the optimal routine.

***

## Can neuropathy be reversed with intermittent fasting?

Neuropathy may be reversible with intermittent fasting, though it also depends on your diet when you're not fasting. Intermittent fasting is a powerful tool for addressing issues related to glucose and insulin, as fasting naturally reduces sugar intake. This reduction can significantly benefit the nervous system and help alleviate conditions associated with diabetes.

***

## Can OMAD cause nutrient deficiencies?

Yes, OMAD can cause nutrient deficiencies, which can lead to fatigue, poor concentration, irritability, skin issues, and hair thinning.

However, nutrient gaps can be avoided by prioritizing a wide range of nutrient-dense whole foods and taking high-quality dietary supplements.

***

## Can type 1 diabetics do prolonged fasts?

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do _not_ encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provide this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast. If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

[Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz\&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

**The focus of type-1 diabetics is to keep their glucose level under control. This is important. However, it’s also important to keep an eye on your level of insulin. The number of carbs you eat determines the amount of insulin you need. So if you consume lots of carbs, you have to use a lot of insulin. Insulin takes excess glucose and starts to store it throughout the body.**

Taking too much insulin is just as bad as having too much glucose. Fasting will help lower the amount of insulin that you need. Many type-1 diabetics have something called double diabetes.

This is a situation where your pancreas isn’t able to produce insulin (type-1), and your cells are also resistant to insulin (type-2). This means that taking insulin doesn’t always work—your insulin receptors don’t absorb the insulin you inject.

Doing fasting and healthy keto helps prevent insulin resistance.

**While you fast, it’s important to also take nutrients, including:**

• Electrolytes

• B-vitamins

• Trace minerals

• Vitamin C

• Vitamin E

## Cognitive Enhancements Through Fasting

Fasting can significantly enhance cognitive functions such as learning, memory, and alertness. It boosts synaptic plasticity, which is vital for forming and strengthening neuronal connections, thereby improving memory and learning abilities. Animal studies indicate that intermittent fasting can enhance spatial memory and increase the expression of genes related to synaptic plasticity.

Additionally, fasting promotes mental clarity and alertness by increasing ketone production, providing a stable energy source for the brain. It also reduces brain inflammation, which is linked to various neurological conditions, including depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases.

***

## Crafting Your Intermittent Fasting Schedule

Intermittent fasting (IF) offers versatile options that can align with your lifestyle. Choosing the right fasting window and incorporating supportive supplements can optimize your IF plan for sustainable results.

**Selecting Your Fasting Window**

Consider your daily routine and preferences when choosing a fasting window:

\- **16/8**: Fast for 16 hours and eat within an 8-hour window, typically skipping breakfast and starting your first meal at lunchtime.

\- **18/6**: Fast for 18 hours with a 6-hour eating window.

\- **20/4**: A more advanced method with a 20-hour fast and a 4-hour eating window, known as the Warrior Diet.

\- **OMAD (One Meal A Day)**: Consume all daily calories in a single meal within a 1-hour window.

Starting with a 16/8 schedule is often advisable for beginners, gradually progressing as your body adapts. The key is to find a plan that is both sustainable and enjoyable.

**Supporting Supplements**

To enhance your fasting experience, consider these supplements:

\- **Electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium, and magnesium help prevent dehydration and maintain electrolyte balance.

\- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Found in fish oil, these support brain health and reduce inflammation.

\- **Probiotics**: Improve gut health and nutrient absorption.

Before adding new supplements, consult with a healthcare professional, especially if you have existing health conditions or are on medication.

By customizing your fasting schedule and supporting it with appropriate supplements, you can maximize the benefits of intermittent fasting and improve overall well-being.

***

## Do I eat less or more calories on intermittent fasting?

**If someone is struggling to lose weight, they typically reduce the calories and end up finding that it will not work.**

Lowering the calories does eventually lower your metabolism. Yet, if you compare spreading your calories out with three meals with two snacks on a 1500 calories per day diet with an increase in calories (2000) for a given day - but ONLY consume two meals per day, you will lose more weight.

**The reason for this is twofold:**

1\. Every time you eat, you stimulate insulin. And insulin is the hormone that blocks fat burning and weight loss.

2\. In the presence of only a tiny excess of insulin above normal will nullify and block fat burning.

***

## Do I need a multivitamin supplement on Intermittent Fasting?

When you consume less frequent foods, growth hormone is elevated and this protects you from the loss of protein and helps you get into autophagy, which helps you recycle protein better.

Amino acids are easy to get even if you do one meal a day. Fatty acids are also easy to get on this plan, because your proteins normally already contain the fat. This will also supply the fat soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) and then we get to vitamins. Vitamins come in two categories, fat-soluble and water-soluble.

The water-soluble vitamins like C and B complex can be gotten from your vegetables and nutritional yeast. Your minerals can also be gotten from your vegetables, but trace minerals are difficult to get. You may want to take some extra sea kelp or seafood to get these.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/do-i-need-multivitamins-on-intermittent-fasting-drberg)

***

## Do medications slow down results from Keto and Intermittent Fasting?

Metformin and Insulin will definitely slow the results because the goal is to lower insulin. Steroids are an injection for inflammation and skin problems can block your keto results. Anti-Depressants could slow the results and will give you side effects such as weight gain and statins worsen the results.

**Some Top Medications:**

* Metformin
* Insulin
* Steroids
* Anti-Depressants
*   Statins

## Do women need more carbs on Keto and Intermittent Fasting?

A lot of women ask because when they eat carbohydrates, they feel better. You might be one of them. So it seems logical to conclude you need carbs. When you’re intermittent fasting but not yet keto-adapted, and your blood sugar drops, your brain function takes a hit. You may feel moody, irritable, and have brain fog. Then you eat carbs, and you feel so much better.

But what’s really going on is that your body isn’t responding to insulin correctly. You have insulin resistance. In response, your pancreas makes several times more insulin than is healthy. The combination of high insulin and intermittent fasting crashes your blood sugar, and you feel terrible.

\*\*The solution is to fix the insulin resistance and get your insulin levels normal, not eat more carbs. You heal insulin resistance by keeping carbs low, and by fasting. Once you fully adapt to fat for fuel, your brain will no longer need carbohydrates to function well. \*\* It takes time to teach your body to burn fat and be in ketosis. Eating certain foods and easing into intermittent fasting will help you feel better. Give your brain time to adapt to fat burning. If you still get symptoms like brain fog and irritability, add more protein instead of carbohydrates.

**My answer is no, women don’t need more carbs on keto and intermittent fasting. You just need to fully understand what’s happening within your body. Then move gradually into the keto diet and intermittent fasting.**

## Does fasting affect growth hormone?

Growth hormone is naturally produced in the body and has many benefits, including boosting fat-burning, preserving and increasing muscle mass, boosting collagen (anti-aging), and increasing bone density. As you age, your body begins to produce less growth hormone.

Fasting can boost the production of growth hormone in your body, with a 2-day fast increasing levels by as much as 200% in the body. Adopting intermittent fasting will also boost growth hormone on a smaller scale, helping you preserve muscle mass better than a low-calorie diet can. The anti-aging effects of increasing growth hormone are a great reason to adopt intermittent fasting as an eating pattern.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-fasting-does-to-growth-hormone)

***

## Does fasting boost testosterone?

Intermittent fasting can potentially increase testosterone by 180%. It does this by triggering the hypothalamus and releasing GRH. Insulin will kill your testosterone levels, and fasting prevents you from having insulin spikes.

As you lose weight, it will likely get easier and easier to stimulate testosterone. Consider fasting for at least 16 hours with an 8-hour eating window. It may also be beneficial to work up to 20 hours of fasting with a 4-hour window of eating.

***

## Does fasting decrease breast milk supply?

Fasting can decrease milk supply due to caloric restriction and may result in inadequate levels of essential nutrients, including vitamins and minerals, which can affect the quality and quantity of breast milk.

***

## Does fasting help with ADHD?

Some fascinating research shows that intermittent fasting and prolonged fasting may significantly affect the brain's frontal lobe and create significant improvements in cognition.

**Fasting may potentially help improve cognitive functions, including:**

• Focus

• Memory

• Concentration

• Clarity

• Creativity

**The study relates to improving the front part of the brain, which is involved with:**

• Paying attention

• Making decisions

• Organizing

• Planning

Experts will say that ADHD is a chemical imbalance, that it's genetics, or that the brain is somehow rewired for these symptoms. But, these theories have never been proven. There are medications, but they have side effects that may even potentially create the same symptoms they're supposed to get rid of.

Basically, with fasting, you stop feeding the brain glucose. As a survival mechanism, the body switches over to making a preferred source of fuel called ketones. Certain parts of the brain need glucose, but the body can make the glucose it needs from non-carbohydrate sources like fat and protein. You don't need to consume glucose to feed the brain glucose.

When you fast, you give the brain ketones. Ketones can do many incredible things, including potentially improving cognitive functions.

**If you have any problems with focus, concentration, or clarity, you may want to try fasting as well as a few other things, including:**

• Vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast)

• Zinc

• Omega-3 fatty acids

***

## Does fasting help with COPD?

**COPD is a condition triggered by chronic smoking or pollution that causes an inflamed irritated lung which develops scar tissue and obstructs the lungs capacity to receive oxygen and eliminates oxygen.**

**COPD Symptoms:**

• Coughing

• Mucus

• Shortness of Breath

• Chronic Adrenals

It is highly recommended to do the combination of the healthy ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting.

**Reducing carbs will reduce inflammation and oxidative damage in the body.**

1\. Intermittent Fasting is going to drop the inflammation + help clean up scar tissue

2\. Vitamin D (High) and Vitamin K2

3\. Hyperbaric

4\. Pneumatrophin PMG (Standard Process)

**Fear is an emotion that helps us survive, but it’s not good when the body is in a chronic state of fear.**

**I believe one of the most powerful things you can do is fasting. There are many different things fasting can do for the brain, immune system, and mood. It can potentially elevate your mood from a chronic state of anxiety or fear to a much higher state.**

Fasting is a survival mechanism that helps you survive in times of danger and tends to counter the fear emotion. It supports the adrenal glands, a structure in the brain called the amygdala, and the sympathetic nervous system.

The amygdala has a lot to do with fear. The sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) is located inside the adrenal glands and mid-back nerves. Some studies show that fasting may help the adrenal glands, amygdala, and sympathetic nervous system.

**Potential benefits of fasting for fear-related disorders:**

• It may help improve a person’s mood

• It increases GABA

• It increases dopamine

• It reduces cortisol

• It reduces the fight or flight mechanism by improving sympathetic nervous system dominance

**How to do fasting for fear-related disorders:**

• Don’t eat if you’re not hungry, especially in the morning

• Do two meals a day (lunch and dinner) with zero snacking

Step 1. Do intermittent fasting without changing your diet

Step 2. Do intermittent fasting with the healthy keto diet

## Does fasting help with visceral belly fat?

Correct intermittent fasting patterns can target visceral fat. The key lies in maintaining a consistent ketogenic diet in combination with intermittent fasting, unlike patterns such as every-other-day fasting or the 5:2 method, which can slow down weight loss by disrupting the body's fuel adaptation process. For optimal results in targeting belly fat and correcting metabolism, combining keto with intermittent fasting is recommended.

## Does fasting turn into starving?

You first need to know that the average non-overweight person is carrying around 100,000 calories of fat on their body. They are only carrying about 1,700 calories of stored sugar.

**If you weighed 150 lbs, you would burn around 1,000-2,000 calories per day. This means that you have around 67 days worth of calories stored on your body. The difference between fasting and starving is that with fasting, you’re living off of your fat fuel. When you’re starving, you’ve already used up all of your fat fuel, and you begin burning your muscle and organs for fuel.**

If you have 100-200 lbs of extra fat, you have many calories stored. The effects of fasting and starving are different. When you’re fasting, you don’t feel hungry—when you’re starving, you do. When you’re starving, you also feel irritable, apathetic, fatigued, and weak. You also develop nutrient deficiencies when you’re starving. Fasting helps you feel energetic, focus, and calm. Intermittent fasting alone will not cause starvation. While you’re fasting, make sure you take nutrients, so you don’t develop a deficiency.

## Does intermittent fasting affect eyes and vision?

Diabetes is a major cause of poor vision, affecting the kidneys, heart, nervous system, and eyes, and can lead to diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, macular degeneration, and cataracts. These eye issues stem from insulin resistance, so addressing this can improve eyesight. Intermittent fasting is effective for reducing insulin resistance, normalizing blood sugar, and promoting autophagy, which helps clean up damaged proteins in the eyes. If vision worsens initially on keto and intermittent fasting, it indicates your body needs more time to adapt.

***

## Does intermittent fasting boost the immune system?

Fasting improves the function of white blood cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes. Remarkably, 85% of your immune system is located in your gut. Additionally, a process called autophagy helps the body clean up old, damaged parts and flush out microbes such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, yeast, and mold. Intermittent fasting is an excellent tool for reducing allergies, gut inflammatory conditions, and even the risk of certain diseases.

## Does Intermittent Fasting cause gallstones?

When we don't eat, we concentrate our bile up to 20x, and the more concentrated it is, the better to ensure we do not get stones. Also saturated fat triggers the release of bile and low fats dry up bile. Its the lack of bile that causes gallstones, not the excess. High carbs tend to lower your bile and cause gallstones as well.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/does-intermittent-fasting-causes-gallstones-drberg)

***

## Does intermittent fasting increase gallbladder sludge?

Intermittent fasting can lead to gallbladder sludge due to concentrated bile during periods of fasting, typically peaking around 10 to 15 hours after the last meal. Symptoms include right shoulder and abdominal pain, bloating, burping, and nausea. To mitigate these issues:

1\. Add lemon or apple cider vinegar to water during fasting to help thin bile.

2\. Gradually introduce fats in a ketogenic diet to avoid overwhelming the gallbladder.

3\. Keto and intermittent fasting can lower insulin levels, reducing the risk of gallstone formation typically associated with high insulin.

## Does intermittent fasting kill candida?

A few symptoms of Candida are achiness of joints, fatigue, itchiness of the body, and digestive issues just to name a few. You want to stay away from sugar, birth control pills can accelerate it as well as stress.

Doing intermittent fasting for at least 18 hours or more will put your body in an autophagy state in which the body would eliminate yeast, mold, fungus, and candida. Adding Thyme oil, grapefruit, and seed extract can help with the healing process.

***

## Does Keto and fasting increase stress hormones?

**The answer is no.**

Some people believe that it appears to be stressful on the body because you're starving the body of glucose. But, a person has fat on their body to be used as fuel. I believe it's logical that our bodies are meant to run off of fat between meals.

**Cortisol is a stress hormone. Cortisol is also called glucocorticoid. One of the big functions of cortisol is to keep your blood sugars from getting too low. It will release stored glucose or cause the production of glucose to maintain the blood sugars. This isn't a stress event. It's a normal thing that occurs in the body.**

It takes about three days for the body to start adapting from burning glucose to burning fat. Cortisol can rise a little bit when a person goes through the three-day keto-adaptation phase, but then it levels out.

When you run your body on glucose, it is very stressful for the body, and you can't tap into your own fat. But, when you get into ketosis, you could go from a stress state to a much higher level of calmness and state of well-being. Burning fat or being in ketosis is a non-stressful state. Keep in mind, when you start keto and fasting, it's important to take electrolytes and B vitamins.

## Does skipping meals slow metabolism?

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/will-skipping-meals-increase-your-metabolism-drberg)

We have to differentiate between skipping a meal, otherwise known as infrequent meals or intermittent fasting, from just being on a low-calorie diet. They are two different things. When you decrease the frequency of your meals you’ll probably automatically reduce your calories. When you reduce your calories and the frequency of your meals you won’t feel too good. Here’s an example. I’ve done several cleanses in the past, I think it was the lemon water, cayenne pepper, and maple syrup one. I did it for ten days and it almost killed me!

The maple syrup was enough glucose to keep me out of ketosis and keep my blood sugar up and down while I was basically starving to death. I was so hungry it was torturous. I’ve done other cleanses and also felt terrible. So if someone brought up fasting, I’d reject it. But what I didn’t know then that I know now is that if you do keto (low carb) and infrequent meals and ease gradually into fasting, your hunger goes away. You adapt to burning your own fat.

**When you eat more frequently you can’t get into fat-burning mode.** **You’ll have a lot of blood sugar issues, but you won’t on keto and intermittent fasting. When you decrease meals you decrease insulin, which automatically increases your metabolic rate. You’ll feel really good because your brain loves ketones. If you do a search on how to increase your metabolism you’ll find suggestions like drink more water, eat more protein, eat spicy foods, and drink green tea. These are trivial.**

**These are the things that affect your metabolism:**

●Age, which you can’t do much about

●Dieting; go on keto and decrease the frequency of your meals

●Your diet as an infant or your mother’s diet when she was pregnant with you. If it was high carb and she developed insulin resistance you’re at higher risk of becoming prediabetic and having a slow metabolism.

●Insulin levels; decrease your meal frequency without cutting calories and see how much weight you lose

●Cortisol levels; decrease your stress

Skipping meals doesn’t slow your metabolism!

## Epigenetic Effects and Potential Risks of Dry Fasting

Dry fasting induces epigenetic changes that influence gene expression and stimulate autophagy, the body's process for recycling damaged cells. However, it is crucial to be aware of potential risks, such as dehydration and kidney strain. Prolonged dry fasting can lead to complications like kidney stones if not monitored carefully.

Consult a healthcare professional before beginning dry fasting to balance its potential benefits and risks.

In nature, plants undergo a similar process during droughts, conserving resources and enhancing resilience. For example, grapevines in arid conditions produce high-quality grapes as they prioritize fruit quality over quantity.

These natural phenomena illustrate how dry fasting can optimize resource use and promote healthier biochemical responses, reflecting the adaptive strategies seen in both human and plant physiology.

## Exercise Considerations During a Prolonged Fast & Safety

An appropriate level of physical activity is acceptable during a prolonged fast. Below are guidelines for exercise while fasting.

1. **Choose Light Activities**: During a prolonged fast, engaging in light physical activities such as walking or yoga is advisable. These types of exercises help maintain muscle mass without excessively draining energy reserves.
2. **Avoid High-Intensity Workouts**: High-intensity exercise is too demanding during a prolonged fast. It significantly increases fatigue and demands on nutrient reserves, increasing muscle loss risk due to the lack of calorie intake.
3. **Focus on Recovery**: Since the body's recovery might be reduced during a fast, ensuring adequate rest and recovery time between physical activities is crucial.
4. **Monitor Your Body's Response**: Pay close attention to how your body responds to exercise during fasting. If you experience unusual fatigue, dizziness, or other concerning symptoms, reducing the intensity or duration of your workouts is advised.

These recommendations aim to balance the benefits of exercise with the need to conserve energy and prevent adverse effects during a prolonged fast.

This information is provided from [Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz\&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do _not_ encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provides this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast. If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

## Fasting messed up my menstrual cycle. How do I fix it?

When you eat you need to really make sure you have all the nutrients because there's going to be this hormonal shift and you want to make sure when you're on fasting that you have enough reserve of these hormones. And so especially the fat soluble vitamins, vitamin A, E, D, K1 and K2.

***

## Have you seen any data that indicates intermittent fasting increases the risk of gut and liver cancer?

There is no evidence to suggest that intermittent fasting increases the risk of gut or liver cancer. In fact, throughout human evolution, periods of fasting were common, and our genes are well-adapted to this pattern. Intermittent fasting can help regulate insulin levels, unlike frequent eating, which can lead to constant insulin spikes. Humans, like animals in the wild, are not designed to graze continuously but to eat when genuinely hungry.

***

## How can I avoid compromising my training while fasting and what should I consume after a fast?

Fasting can actually enhance recovery from exercise by countering some of the damage caused by physical activity. Exercising in a fasted state may offer additional benefits, and monitoring your recovery through sleep quality, soreness, or heart rate variability can be helpful.

After a short fast (1-2 days), there's little risk in what you consume post-fast, especially if you've been eating well. However, for longer fasts (3-5 days), be cautious when reintroducing carbohydrates, as a rapid intake can cause an electrolyte imbalance. It's best to break a prolonged fast with smaller portions of food to ease your body back into normal eating.

***

## How can I avoid getting angry while I do intermittent fasting?

When you start intermittent fasting, your body is initially running on sugar stores. After a long enough period, your body will have used up all the glycogen and will switch over to burning fat for energy. If you eat a meal high in sugars after a period of intermittent fasting, this will cause a drastic spike in insulin, leading to irritability. To avoid this, be sure that your meals are rich in nutrients and low in carbohydrates, so that your blood sugar remains in a healthy range and you do not experience mood swings.

## How can I enhance autophagy?

Autophagy is a process where the body removes and recycles damaged or unnecessary cells and cell parts, replacing them with new, undamaged components. This process can be induced by intermittent fasting, as long periods without eating allows the body to focus on repairs. Autophagy is beneficial because it is a neuroprotective state, cadio protective, and can boost the immune system.

## How can I improve my sleep when on Intermittent fasting plan?

**Sleep is vitally important when you’re on keto and intermittent fasting. Let’s find out how to improve sleep if you’re having challenges.**

A lack of high-quality sleep could be the reason you’re not losing weight. Most of the hard-core fat-burning through the stimulation of growth hormone happens when you’re asleep. Also, fixing insulin resistance and blood sugar problems requires sleep. If you have diabetes, you probably notice that your blood sugars are way off on the days when you didn’t get a good night’s sleep.

Insomnia is a symptom of another problem; insomnia isn’t a disease. Let’s go through some reasons why you may not be getting high-quality sleep.

**The first is frequent eating.** If you’re not doing intermittent fasting, and you eat snacks between meals, that will spike your insulin. You’ll be tired during the day but not be able to sleep at night. So, plus in intermittent fasting. Three meals per day, no snacks, then gradually move to two meals per day, no snacks.

**Second, you may be getting up frequently to urinate.** That’s a problem with insulin resistance. One of the symptoms of diabetes is frequent urination. Doing keto and intermittent fasting correctly will eventually correct the frequent urination. If you want to do a test to determine if you have a problem with insulin resistance, get a test called HOMA-IR.

Or you may have problems with your adrenals caused by accumulated stress in your body. Your body is in a constant state of flight or fight. I suggest a natural sleep aid and massage. If you’re consuming foods that cause you to bloat, such as cruciferous vegetables, that could disrupt your sleep. Start eating regular green lettuce instead, for example. Reduce the amount of cruciferous vegetables you consume, then gradually increase it.

**Lastly, sleep apnea could be the culprit.** It’s a problem of too much insulin. Keto and intermittent fasting will eventually correct it and help improve your sleep.

## How can I lose weight with intermittent fasting?

Intermittent fasting is a pattern of eating and not eating that doesn't dictate specific foods or calorie reduction but instead focuses on when you eat. It's a crucial factor in weight loss, influencing growth hormone stimulation for anti-aging and fat burning while decreasing insulin levels, which is essential for weight loss. Intermittent fasting can also aid in reversing insulin resistance, a condition characterized by excessive insulin production. Starting slowly and gradually extending fasting periods is recommended, progressing from fewer meals to longer fasting windows, such as 16 hours fasting with an 8-hour eating window, then eventually transitioning to two meals a day with a 20-hour fasting period and a 4-hour eating window.

## How can I prevent bad breath while fasting?

To prevent bad breath while fasting, maintain a healthy ketogenic diet with high chlorophyll content from greens. This should minimize odor issues, especially once you're fully adapted to ketosis. If bad breath persists, consider incorporating probiotics such as sauerkraut or plain kefir to support gut health.

***

## How can I prevent cramping and nail splitting during prolonged fasts?

Biotin would help. That usually comes from the gut. It's in the category of B vitamins, but also silicon also is good for nail cracking. But I would look at both of those being a problem, especially if you're doing fasting, you're probably going to add some supplement to that.

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do _not_ encourage prolonged fasting.

## How do you know when autophagy starts?

Autophagy is associated with various signs, including increased ketone levels, reduced appetite, and increased cognition.

Bad breath can also signal autophagy as the body produces a type of ketone called acetone, which can lead to body odor and bad breath.

***

## How does fasting influence the Autonomic Nervous System?

The autonomic nervous system is part of the nervous system that works on automatic. It does many different things.

**The three divisions of the autonomic nervous system:**

1\. Sympathetic (fight or flight)

2\. Parasympathetic (rest and digest)

3\. Enteric (part of the digestive system)

There is a condition called diabetic autonomic neuropathy that occurs with diabetics. It’s well known that diabetes can cause peripheral neuropathy. But, diabetes can also destroy the nerves of the autonomic nervous system. This can greatly influence your heart, digestion, and other organs.

**Diabetic autonomic neuropathy can potentially lead to health problems, such as:** • Increased pulse rate • High blood pressure • Erectile dysfunction • Orthostatic hypotension • Constipation • Gastroparesis • Hypoglycemia • Thermoregulation problems

If you have any of the above symptoms, you may want to start fasting. Fasting may help improve your overall autonomic nervous system.

**Natural remedies for diabetic autonomic neuropathy:** • Benfotiamine • Alpha-lipoic acid

***

## How does fasting influence your genes?

Your genes are your blueprints or your code for building proteins. These proteins are involved in all of the biochemistry in your body—from making hormones and neurotransmitters to releasing stored glucose for fuel.

You have millions upon millions of these proteins, but they have to be instructed on what to do. When someone does fasting, many interesting things happen to your genetics. Fasting is one very important part of your epigenetics.

**Epigenetics are things that influence your genes. Your genes are like a series of light switches—they can be turned on and turned off. Epigenetics has the ability to turn on and off each light switch.**

As an example, fasting positively influences the gene CFHR1, which regulates your cholesterol. It also influences the SIRT-3 gene, which has anti-aging potential. Fasting also down-regulates genes like the APP gene that helps lower amyloid plaque, which is seen in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. Fasting may also play a role in other genes that influence cancer risks.

**Fasting can help:**

• Lower inflammation

• Support your immune system

• Lower syndrome X

• Support healthy brain cells

• Promote a healthy mood and mind

## How does intermittent fasting affect the gut flora?

Intermittent fasting is one of the best ways to ensure the health of your gut. When you begin fasting regularly, this helps your gut increase resistance to oxidative and xenobiotic stress. It also increases the diversity of microbes in the gut while helping tolerance for bad bacteria. If you struggle with a weak intestinal lining, fasting can help your body repair this as well. Regular fasting also helps reduce _Candida_ infections and allows healthy gut microbes to live longer.

***

## How is intermittent fasting connected to blood sugar levels and the adrenal glands?

When transitioning between meals, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) may occur. Normally, the adrenals and liver raise glucose levels. Weak adrenals can lead to severe drops in blood sugar, causing symptoms. Strong adrenals typically prevent hypoglycemia during intermittent fasting (IF). IF isn't harmful to adrenals, but with weak adrenals, it should be approached gradually, incorporating more fat, B vitamins, and potassium.

***

## How long do I need to fast to spike brainpower?

**To start seeing these incredible cognitive benefits, you have to fast for at least 18 hours a day.**

With an 18:6 intermittent fasting pattern, you would fast for 18 hours and have a 6-hour eating window. This means no snacking while fasting. You can eat during your 6-hour window, but I recommend only two meals. If you are still hungry, add more fat at the end of your meals.

Ketones are very therapeutic for your brain.

**There are three ways to get your body to produce ketones:**

1\. Go on the keto diet

2\. Fasting

3\. Exercise

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/dramatically-spike-brainpower-with-an-18-hour-fast)

***

## How long does it take to start autophagy?

There’s no proven timeframe for when autophagy starts in humans, as it depends on the individual's metabolism, activity levels, and nutritional status.

However, animal studies suggest that advanced autophagy occurs around 24 hours of fasting and increases with prolonged caloric restriction.

***

## How low-calorie diets and intermittent fasting affect metabolism?

**Low-calorie diets:**

• Slow your metabolism

• Raises your set point (you can’t lose weight once you hit a certain point that’s typically high)

• Decrease muscle

• Increase cravings and hunger

• Don’t put a person in fat-burning

• Ignore how food triggers certain hormones

• Ignore the nutrients in the calories

**Intermittent fasting:**

• Speeds up metabolism

• Lowers your set point (allows your weight to go down)

• Improves muscle by triggering growth hormone

• Decreases cravings and hunger

• Puts a person in fat-during

• Considers the hormone aspects, especially insulin

• Promotes eating nutrient-dense foods when eating

**Low-calorie diets focus on restricting calories, but intermittent fasting focuses on restricting the frequency of eating. Intermittent fasting doesn’t lower your calories when you do eat.**

**With intermittent fasting, when you do eat a meal, you want it to have healthy fats, a moderate amount of protein, and nutrient-dense vegetables. Having a nice big meal will help you switch over to fat-burning when you’re fasting and help make it easier to fast. A great form of intermittent fasting is having two meals a day without snacks.**

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/how-low-calorie-diets-intermittent-fasting-affect-metabolism-drberg)

***

## How often should I do a 24-Hour fast?

While some people fast for 24 hours once a week, others practice this type of fast once or twice a month or whenever needed.

_**We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements.**_

***

## How often should I do Intermittent Fasting?

Intermittent fasting offers several schedules, each with its own benefits. The 16:8 method involves fasting for 16 hours and eating within an 8-hour window, typically with two meals. Alternatively, the 20:4 schedule extends the fasting period to 20 hours, followed by a 4-hour eating window, offering additional benefits for brain function, heart health, repair, and anti-aging. OMAD (One Meal A Day) condenses eating into a single daily meal, sometimes necessitating alternate-day OMAD for optimal results. While intermittent fasting, it's advisable to combine it with a healthy ketogenic diet. Try to start with three meals a day without snacking, gradually transition to fewer meals, and listen to your hunger cues so that you can adjust your intermittent fasting plan to best suit your needs.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/how-often-should-you-do-intermittent-fasting)

***

## How to avoid excessive bloating on intermittent fasting?

When reducing meal frequency, increasing portion size can lead to bloating and stress the digestive system. Strategies to overcome this include separating macro-calories, stretching out meals over two hours, and avoiding combining too many food types. Additionally, issues like low stomach acid, certain bloat-inducing vegetables, food allergies like dairy, and fat intake are important to manage, as they can affect digestion and hunger levels differently for each person.

Adjustments should be made based on your individual needs and reactions, but after the body adjusts to a fast, bloating becomes very unlikely as the digestive system will be running smoother than ever.

## How to Break a Prolonged Fast & Refeeding

**Understanding Refeeding Syndrome After Prolonged Fasting**

Prolonged fasting (4-7+ days) carries the risk of refeeding syndrome, a rare but potentially serious condition. This occurs when your body rapidly shifts nutrients from the bloodstream into cells, especially if you were already nutrient deficient before the fast.

**Why It Happens:** Pre-existing nutrient deficiencies worsen during a fast. When you suddenly reintroduce food, your body can experience dangerous imbalances. People with known vitamin deficiencies should avoid prolonged fasting.

**Prevention is Key:** During a prolonged fast, it's crucial to supplement with vitamins, electrolytes, and sea salt. This helps maintain balance and won't break your fast.

**Breaking Your Fast Safely:** Ease back into eating slowly with keto-friendly foods. Avoid carbohydrates, sugars, and non-keto foods, as they can worsen nutrient depletion. Start with small portions and gradually increase as your body adjusts.

**Important:** If you have any underlying health conditions, always consult your doctor before starting a prolonged fast.

## How to Break Your Prolonged Fast

Breaking a prolonged fast safely is crucial to avoid potential health issues such as refeeding syndrome. This severe and potentially fatal medical condition happens when you start to increase your calorie intake after a prolonged fast. The reintroduction of carbohydrates triggers a shift from fat to carbohydrate metabolism, leading to severe electrolyte imbalances and fluid alterations. These imbalances can cause complications such as heart failure, seizures, and, in extreme cases, death. A crucial factor contributing to refeeding syndrome is nutrient deficiency, particularly phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium, which are rapidly depleted as they are used in metabolizing glucose upon resuming eating. This condition underscores the importance of carefully planning and executing the transition from fasting to a typical eating pattern to avoid such risks.

Please review “[The #1 Danger of Prolonged Fasting You HAVE to Know About](https://youtu.be/ldi9vElgemE?si=Vvq1e-m8sgxxv15J)” to learn more about refeeding syndrome, its risks, and ways to help avoid it.

Here are the steps to safely break a prolonged fast, based on Dr. Berg's advice:

1. **Start Slowly**: Begin by consuming small amounts of food. It's important not to overwhelm your digestive system, which has been resting during the fast.
2. **Supplement with Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)**: Essential for glucose metabolism and helps convert food into energy. It is particularly crucial during refeeding to help prevent refeeding syndrome.
3. **Avoid High-Carbohydrate Foods**: Avoid foods high in carbohydrates immediately after a fast. They can rapidly deplete minerals like potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and B1, increasing the risk of refeeding syndrome.
4. **Choose the Right Foods**:
5. **Keto-Friendly Foods**: [Keto-friendly foods](https://www.drberg.com/ketosis-approved-foods) help maintain stable blood sugar levels and prevent sudden depletion of essential minerals.
6. **Easy-to-Digest Foods**: Foods like soups, smoothies, or bone broth are recommended as they are gentle on the stomach and more easily digested.
7. **Gradual Increase**: Gradually increase the quantity and variety of foods over several days. This allows your body to adapt without causing undue stress on your metabolic system.
8. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay close attention to how your body reacts during refeeding. If you experience any adverse symptoms, you may need to adjust and consume less food and/or space out your intake of nutrients.

These steps can help reintroduce food to support your body’s needs and minimize potential risks. Consult a healthcare professional before starting or ending a prolonged fast, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions.

## How to optimize protein intake during intermittent fasting?

**Optimizing Fat Loss and Muscle Preservation with a Ketogenic Diet and Intermittent Fasting**

Combining a ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting is an effective strategy for enhancing fat loss while preserving muscle mass. To maximize benefits, strategically time your protein intake during your eating window.

**Adjusting Protein Intake**

Distribute your protein intake evenly across meals. Aim for 21 to 42 grams of high-quality protein per meal to support muscle protein synthesis and satiety.

**Fasting and Muscle Preservation**

Intermittent fasting helps preserve muscle mass during calorie restriction by increasing growth hormone release, which supports lean tissue maintenance and fat burning. Studies suggest that intermittent fasting may reduce the protein required for muscle maintenance, allowing for slightly lower protein intake while still benefiting from muscle preservation.

## How to overcome no will power to start Intermittent Fasting?

Fasting is an exercise for willpower. Willpower is the ability to control your thoughts and actions in order to do what you want. It's the power of self-control. It's your personal power to overcome things like temptations, addictions, and cravings.

Willpower helps you stick to something, but it's like a muscle that needs to be developed and strengthened. You can do this through intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting is basically a workout to improve your willpower.

**Fasting removes barriers that keep people from doing fasting in the first place, such as:**

• Hunger

• Cravings

• Bad habits

**Tips to help with fasting and enhance your willpower:**

1\. Start doing intermittent fasting (skip breakfast and don't consume snacks) without keto

2\. Add MCT oil

3\. Start Healthy Keto

4\. Find keto-friendly replacements for your favorite foods

## How to Safely Extending a Fasting Window - Intermittent Fasting - Prolonged Fasting

To safely extend intermittent fasting into prolonged fasting, follow a gradual and well-planned approach to allow your body to adapt to more extended periods without food. Here are some guidelines for prolonging a fasting window:

1. Extend your intermittent fast from a 20:4 fasting and feeding window to a 22:2 or an OMAD intermittent fast. Pay attention to how your body responds. If you experience fatigue, a lowering of mood, or anxiety, these could be signs that you’re advancing too quickly. Once you have safely completed OMAD, return to a 20:4 or 22:2 fasting pattern for a day or two before you attempt your following OMAD intermittent fasting pattern. Once you have established a regular pattern of OMAD fasting, it is a good idea to have a weekly feeding day, with an extended feeding window with three meals, to ensure you build up your nutrient reserves for the following OMAD schedule.
2. Before attempting a 36- or 48-hour fast, it's crucial to establish a consistent OMAD eating pattern and a solid nutritional foundation. Always consult your doctor, especially if you have any health concerns. During extended fasts, follow the safety guidelines listed above.
3. A 72-hour fast or longer must be performed with a healthcare provider, as the longer the fast, the longer the recovery period between prolonged fasts. As a general guideline, for every _day_ of a prolonged fast, you should recover and rebuild your nutrient reserves for at least the same number of _weeks_ before your next prolonged fast. For example, a 3-day fast (72 hours) should be followed by three weeks of recovery before attempting another 3-day fast. This general guideline should be followed only after consulting your healthcare provider before your next prolonged fast.

This information is provided from [Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz\&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

## How to smoothly transition to fasting?

Transitioning to intermittent fasting can present challenges, but proper preparation can help ease the process and optimize results.

**Managing Transitional Symptoms**

Common symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, nausea, or dizziness, often referred to as "keto flu," may occur as your body shifts from glucose to ketones for energy. Staying hydrated, getting sufficient sleep, and paying attention to your body's signals are essential for managing these symptoms. If needed, shorten your fasting window or break your fast early to aid adaptation.

**Nutrient Optimization**

Ensuring adequate nutrient intake during eating windows is crucial for overall health. Focus on consuming magnesium, potassium, and B vitamins to support bodily functions. Incorporate nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and whole grains to prevent deficiencies. Consider supplements such as magnesium before bed for restful sleep and citrate-rich foods like lemon juice to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance.

## How will fasting affect diabetes?

**The difference between type-1 and type-2 diabetes is that type-1 diabetes is characterized by a lack of insulin due to pancreatic damage.**

Type-2 diabetes is characterized by a lack of insulin sensitivity. When you have insulin resistance, your body creates far too much insulin. However, this insulin isn't effective because your insulin receptors can't pull in the insulin. Over time, type-2 diabetes can exhaust the pancreas, causing a reduction in inulin production. In turn, some severe types of type-2 diabetes may require insulin shots.

**Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) has similar side effects as high insulin. Both can cause damage to your nerves and blood vessels—especially in your eyes, kidneys, arteries, heart, and brain.**

An interesting study on three people found that fasting has the potential to reverse insulin resistance and restore insulin's effects on blood sugar levels. All three patients were able to stop taking insulin. Two of the three patients were able to eliminate all medications, and the other patient eliminated 3 out of 4 medications. These results seem to be due to the fact that lowering your consumption of carbs lowers your need for insulin. Keto and intermittent fasting combined may decrease the need for insulin even further. Make sure you do not stop taking your prescription medications without your doctor's approval. Work with your doctor to get healthier by doing keto and intermittent fasting.

## I ate when I was not hungry while on Keto and Intermittent fasting, is it bad?

Our body is not designed to eat at the frequency that people eat. You have social events, social events, birthdays, vacations, holidays, going out to dinner, etc.

**One of the best habits you can implement is:**

1\. Only eat when you are hungry

2\. Don't eat unless you are hungry.

If you are doing intermittent fasting and not hungry anymore, then do a gradient approach. The main point is keeping your nutrients high, but just eating less frequently. Eating spikes insulin.

## I do OMAD and can not sleep now - what do I do?

Starting OMAD (One Meal A Day) can sometimes lead to sleep issues due to blood sugar fluctuations. Consider adding a small portion (around 50 grams) of blueberries to your meal to ease this transition. Blueberries offer some carbohydrates for blood sugar stability, which could help you sleep better. Ideally, this would also help prevent a morning rise in cortisol, a stress hormone that can disrupt sleep.

***

## I have no appetite on Intermittent fasting - what do I do?

As soon as people start doing intermittent fasting, their appetite goes away, they feel better, they have less inflammation, and they have more energy. But, the thing that most people focus on is weight loss. Many think that the more weight they lose, the healthier they are. But weight loss is just one part of getting healthy.

One problem that many people have is they begin to stop doing healthy keto. This is a huge problem, especially when you're doing one meal a day. Why? Because this can cause some serious nutrient deficiencies. Some nutrient deficiencies take a long time to develop. Others happen quickly. Vitamin B12, for instance, can be stored in the body for up to a year. Other nutrients like potassium aren't stored for very long. If you felt great when you first started intermittent fasting, but down the road, you started to feel worse and worse, this is a sign of a nutrient deficiency. \*\* Signs you may have nutritional deficiencies:\*\*

• Tiredness

• Dizziness

• Weakness

• No endurance

• Hair loss

• Brittle nails

• Mood changes

• Cognitive issues

**If you start consuming just one meal a day on your intermittent fasting program, you should increase your intake of:**

• Omega 3 fatty acids (unless you consume salmon and other fatty fish every other day)

• Protein (8-10 oz. athletes may need more)

• Vitamin C/E/B9/D (eat your vegetables!)

• Minerals

• Trace Minerals

## I try to do OMAD regularly but I get hungry at night. What do you recommend?

Feeling hungry at night while doing OMAD suggests you may not be fully adapted yet, which can take time. I recommend lowering your carb intake and incorporating exercise to help with this adjustment. If, after a few weeks, you're still struggling with hunger, it's important to listen to your body. Not everyone can sustain prolonged fasting, so eat when you're genuinely hungry, and allow your body to guide your eating schedule.

***

## If I'm underweight with autoimmune issues, what should my eating schedule look like autoimmune?

For someone who is underweight with autoimmune issues, incorporating intermittent fasting can be highly beneficial due to its anti-inflammatory effects. Consider adopting a one-meal-a-day (OMAD) approach, ensuring that your single meal is nutrient-dense and includes healthy fats. Prioritize adequate vitamin D intake, as it plays a crucial role in managing inflammation and supporting overall health. Tailoring your eating schedule to include these elements can help address both weight and autoimmune concerns effectively.

***

## I'm experiencing a hair loss on frequent fasting, what can I do?

Hair loss during frequent or prolonged fasting can sometimes be caused by a lack of essential nutrients. Before starting a fast, it's important to build strong nutritional reserves, just like building muscle for exercise. To ease into fasting, start with a healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting with three meals a day. As your body adjusts, gradually skip meals until you reach one meal a day. Extend fasts slowly and carefully. The key is to listen to your body and progress at a comfortable pace.

**Supplement:**

* **Amino Acids (Dr. Minkoff Brand)**-For healthy hair growth, your body relies on a steady supply of protein's building blocks, called amino acids. Diets lacking sufficient protein can disrupt this process and lead to hair growth problems.
* **Trace Minerals** -While a wide range of trace minerals impact hair health, iron, zinc, copper, silicon, and selenium play particularly vital roles in supporting hair follicle function and hair growth.
* **B-Vitamins** - are essential for hair growth because they support two key factors: healthy cell replication (which hair follicles rely on for rapid growth) and strong blood circulation to the scalp (which delivers vital nutrients to the hair follicles).
* **Whole Food Multivitamin** -Gives your body the nutrient reserves it needs to help prevent hair loss during periodic and prolonged fasting.

## I'm feeling weak and fainting after 20 hours of fasting - what do I do?

**Realize this: you’re going from glucose metabolism to running on ketones and fatty acids, which takes time. And it will take a lot longer if you already have diabetes or insulin resistance. It could take months.**

Let’s say you’re at two meals. Your first meal is at 2pm and your second at 6pm, then you fast for twenty hours. If you’re having a hard time with this schedule, and you feel weak and faint, back up a little to eighteen hours of fasting. Eat at 12pm and 6pm. You haven’t given your body enough time to adapt. You want to let how you feel dictate how quickly you should go from, say, thirteen hours or so of fasting, eating three meals per day at 7am, 12pm, and 6pm. If you feel good, then go to eighteen, and then when you feel good, to twenty.

When you’re at three meals per day, avoid snacks and add more fat to your meals until you’re comfortable and your cravings go away. You also want to feel energetic and have good cognitive function.

**Fainting and feeling weak could be low sodium. Make sure you’re consuming at least one teaspoon of sea salt per day. If you’re exercising you may need a teaspoon and a half. You may also need to increase your B vitamins, especially B1, as well as your electrolytes: potassium and magnesium. Your B vitamins and electrolytes are involved in your metabolism, which helps you to make energy so if you're not taking them that could be why you feel weak and faint. You can add MCT oil to your diet, which gives you more ketones to run on.**

You may not be able to get into ketosis without some help if your insulin resistance is severe enough. Other people are using my fasting tea, which seems to help because it has certain phytonutrients to help their blood sugar.

The main point is to reduce your fasting window if you’re feeling weak and faint after twenty hours of intermittent fasting then gradually increase it.

## I'm getting headaches on Keto and Intermittent Fasting - what do I do?

This is a hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) situation, your cells have not yet adapted to running on ketones. The brain is the first organ affected by low blood sugars because it depends on glucose.

## I'm scared to do intermittent fasting, is there anything to worry about?

Intermittent fasting offers numerous benefits, including improved cognitive function such as enhanced focus and memory, mood elevation, reduced inflammation, and the promotion of new cell growth in the brain. To begin fasting, start by consuming three meals a day without snacking. Incorporate more fat into your meals to help extend the time between eating. Initially, the primary goal should not be weight loss but rather reducing hunger and promoting your overall health.

## Intermittent & Prolonged Fasting - Supplement While Fasting

Supplementation of nutrients while fasting is essential for maintaining optimal health. Here is a list of the fundamental nutrient supplements to take while fasting:

1. **Electrolytes with Sea Salt**

Using electrolytes with sea salt while fasting is beneficial for several reasons:

1. **Hydration Maintenance**: Sea salt contains essential trace minerals that help maintain hydration levels. This is crucial during fasting, as the risk of dehydration increases due to the diuretic effect of fasting, which leads to increased urine production.
2. **Electrolyte Balance**: Electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and magnesium, found in sea salt, are vital for maintaining proper electrolyte balance. This balance is crucial for various bodily functions, including muscle contraction and nerve function.
3. **Prevention of Muscle Cramps and Fatigue**: Adequate levels of minerals and electrolytes can help prevent common fasting-related issues such as muscle cramps and fatigue, making the fasting experience more sustainable and safer.
4. **Supports Energy Production**: Electrolytes play a crucial role in supporting the energy-making processes during fasting by maintaining proper cellular function and overall bodily operations.
5. **B Vitamin Complex**: The complete B vitamin complex, including B12 and folate, is essential for energy production and maintaining proper nervous system function.
6. **Trace Minerals**

Certain trace minerals are vital during prolonged fasting due to their roles in maintaining bodily functions and preventing deficiencies that can be exacerbated during fasting periods. Here are some essential trace minerals and their significance:

1. **Zinc**: A deficiency in zinc can impact overall health, and maintaining adequate levels helps support enzyme functions and immune health during fasting.
2. **Iron**: Adequate iron levels are necessary to prevent anemia and ensure oxygen is efficiently transported throughout the body.
3. **Selenium**: Maintaining selenium levels helps support immune function and protect cells from oxidative stress during fasting.
4. **Iodine**: Adequate iodine is necessary to maintain metabolic rate and support overall thyroid health.

A complete trace mineral complex supplement with those listed above is critical to a safe fast.

## Intermittent & Prolonged Fasting Tips - Safety

1. Work with a nutritionist or healthcare provider to monitor your nutrient levels and overall health while fasting.
2. Never push through hunger on a fast. Feelings of hunger and urges are normal and should pass quickly if your body has adequate nutrients to support a fast. However, if feelings of hunger become bothersome to the point your energy and mood decrease or you become anxious, gradually reintroduce food based on the steps outlined in the Breaking Your Prolonged Fast section below.

This information is provided from [Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz\&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

## Is a higher glucose level normal when testing outside of the fasting window?

A higher glucose level outside of the fasting window is generally expected, especially after consuming carbohydrates. However, if blood sugar remains elevated when not eating, it could indicate underlying insulin resistance or other factors. For example, morning glucose spikes can result from cortisol release, which mobilizes stored sugar. Additionally, exercise can temporarily raise blood sugar levels.

To assess long-term glucose control, A1C testing is more informative, as it reflects average blood glucose over three months. To manage higher blood sugar, consider regular exercise, using diluted apple cider vinegar, and incorporating supplements like berberine to support insulin sensitivity.

***

## Is autophagy good for the body?

Yes, autophagy has profound health benefits. This natural process allows the body to recycle and repurpose cell components for energy and healthy tissue generation.

Autophagy plays an important role in reducing disease risk, strengthening the immune system, and slowing aging processes.

***

## Is fasting for 24 hours good?

Apart from promoting weight loss, fasting for 24 hours has other health benefits, including supporting metabolic health, lowering inflammation, and allowing the lining of the digestive tract to regenerate.

Fasting also triggers autophagy, a natural process that clears cellular debris and damaged cell components linked to premature aging and an increased risk of age-related diseases and cancer.

_Please make sure to consult a healthcare provider before you start a fast._

***

## Is fasting good or bad for the liver?

The liver is one of the only organs that can completely regenerate if you have at least 25% of your liver left. If you look down and you have a gut, chances are you have a fatty liver. Fasting however, can help boost the liver's regenerative potential and reduce your weight, which also alleviates pressure on this organ.

Fasting for over 18 hours (after receiving professional medical advice) can help reverse fatty liver disease, reduce an enlarged liver, lower liver enzymes, improve fibrosis, and even stimulate autophagy (the body's repair process). Taking choline and applied cider vinegar in conjunction with fasting.

## Is fasting good to enhance the stem cells?

A stem cell is a cell that doesn’t have a purpose, that can later be transformed when the body needs a certain cell. There are certain parts of the body that can turnover cells very quickly, while other parts take longer. Prolonged fasts of 72 hours or longer have been shown to enhance the production of stem cells. The fat-burning effect that occurs during long fasts helps to fuel the production of stem cells.

## Is fasting healthy for a diabetic?

In the United States alone, there are about 84 million people who are pre-diabetic and 30 million who are diabetic. There is also a large number of people who have insulin resistance and are on their way to becoming a diabetic.

**There are two main mechanisms with diabetes medications:**

1\. Targeting insulin resistance

2\. Increasing insulin

The medications that increase insulin also increase the risk of cardiovascular mortality by 59-68%. What you need to realize is that high insulin is just as damaging as high blood glucose. You need normal insulin, but you don’t need tremendous amounts of insulin. If you combine therapeutic fasting, where you’re making sure you’re getting all of your nutrients, with a low-carb diet—this can produce amazing results.

**A few benefits of fasting for diabetics might be:**

1\. Within 4 months—no need for insulin

2\. A decrease in A1C

3\. A decrease in waist size

4\. Able to control blood sugars

***

## Is feeling cold normal when doing intermittent fasting?

Feeling cold is a normal sensation that occurs when you do not eat for stretches of time. The body's core temperature will decrease due to lower calorie intake and lower levels of blood sugar. As you continue fasting, your body will adapt and the cold feelings will lessen, but you can take vitamin B1 to ease this transition.

## Is intermittent fasting different for women?

The difference between women and men is that women have a more complete reproductive system, which results in higher estrogen levels. This doesn't mean that women shouldn't do intermittent fasting. In fact, unless a woman is pregnant or breastfeeding, intermittent fasting can be extremely beneficial.

***

## Is intermittent fasting good for someone who is a diabetic?

Diabetes is a condition of high sugar (hyperglycemia). The purpose of the medication that diabetic takes is to lower blood sugars – sometimes the medication could drive the blood sugar too low that could cause hypoglycemia.

When you do intermittent fasting, you decrease the need for insulin and the medication for a diabetic. The insulin that the diabetic is taking is not the same as the body produces.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Is intermittent fasting safe for your adrenals?

It's normal for the adrenals to raise cortisol levels during intermittent fasting to counter a low blood sugar level. While many people suffering from adrenal fatigue hear this about fasting and believe it is safer to avoid it, actually the opposite is true. Fasting can be beneficial for the adrenals because it relieves oxidative stress and inflammation, which considerably alleviates stress on the adrenals.

***

## Is it normal to bloat while fasting?

Yes, bloating while fasting is normal and can occur as the digestive system adapts to the change in eating frequency. However, persistent bloating may indicate a more serious issue, such as gut dysbiosis, food allergies, or chronic constipation.

***

## Is it normal to have loose, watery stools during a 48-hour fast?

No, it's not normal. And there's obviously probably something going on with your microbes, that there's some imbalance. And sometimes if you actually do a first fast and you haven't done it before so what can happen is these microbes are so used to getting fed and all of a sudden you don't feed them. What I would probably recommend is to take a probiotic. Take something that survives the stomach acid too. Kefir is a good natural probiotic as well.

***

## Is it ok to take painkillers while fasting?

While it's essential to follow your prescribed medication regimen, fasting can be complemented by addressing pain with natural remedies. Increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D may help manage pain and inflammation. Omega-3s and vitamin D, particularly at levels around 40,000 to 50,000 IU, can be effective for reducing pain and inflammation without significant side effects.

***

## Is it possible to prevent muscle loss on intermittent fasting?

To prevent muscle loss during intermittent fasting, ensure you are consuming enough protein and engaging in regular strength training. You can lift heavy weights at lower repetitions, moderate weights at higher repetitions, or a combination of the two. Distribute protein intake evenly across meals within your eating window.

***

## Is it possible to stop snacking?

The snacking and grazing cycle can lead to fluctuations in blood sugar and insulin levels, potentially contributing to insulin resistance over time. Here's what to consider:

1\. Eating in response to emotions like depression, fatigue, boredom, or stress can exacerbate these feelings and perpetuate the snacking cycle.

2\. Constantly consuming carbohydrates for pleasure may lead to dopamine resistance, impacting mood regulation.

3\. Mindless eating, such as eating out of habit or availability, can keep you trapped in the snacking cycle.

4\. Fasting, when done correctly, can help break this cycle by promoting the body's use of stored fat for energy, leading to reduced hunger and cravings.

5\. Proper fasting may result in improved mood, cognitive function, and overall well-being.

6\. Strategies to break the snacking cycle include skipping breakfast, understanding the relationship between eating and hunger, avoiding junk foods, staying physically active, and minimizing carb intake during meals.

***

## Is Keto effective without intermittent fasting?

While keto is an effective diet that can improve overall health and reduce insulin resistance on its own, it is much more effective when combined with intermittent fasting. Even on a low-carb diet, the more often you eat, the more often you are raising your insulin levels. Intermittent fasting helps keep insulin levels low, making sure you stay in ketosis and lose weight more effectively. Intermittent fasting will also help you break any snacking habits you may have, further increasing the effectiveness of your keto diet.

## Is periodic fasting effective?

There are several popular periodic fasts, such as the 5:2 fast, the 3-days-a-week fast, and the every-other-day fast. However, these can make you feel miserable because they don’t give your body enough time to adapt to fat burning, which takes 3-7 days. Instead of periodic fasting, consistent intermittent fasting on a daily basis is recommended to help you burn fat and improve cognition and mood.

## Is the OMAD diet safe?

Yes, OMAD can be safe when nutrient-dense meals are paired with supplementation.

However, OMAD is an extreme intermittent fasting method that isn’t suitable for everyone.

It’s recommended to consult a healthcare professional before starting OMAD to minimize the risk of adverse health effects.

## Is there a time period that I should be following Keto and Intermittent Fasting?

**The ketogenic diet is a lifelong commitment. Healthy keto with intermittent fasting will work while you do it, but the benefits will stop if you stop. You might see some awesome keto diet results, or intermittent fasting results and think it’s ok to stop. But, the long term effects of keto are so beneficial, you really don’t want to stop.**

The purpose of doing the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting is for so much more than just weight loss. Doing keto long term is a way of eating to minimize health problems. You will eventually build up your health reserve, and you will be able to go off of the program here and there. But, there are no phases of the ketogenic diet. After you reach your keto weight loss goal, instead of adding in carbs, you can add in more calories and more fat.

There are multiple incredible benefits of healthy keto, ketosis, and intermittent fasting. Ketones are a more efficient fuel that your brain and heart prefer. But, one of the biggest problems out there right now is high insulin.

**Healthy keto with intermittent fasting will help you reduce your insulin, which will benefit your:**

• Heart

• Liver

• Brain

• Hormones

• Immune System

• Nerves

• Kidneys

• Eyes

## Keto Friendly Foods that Will Not Break Your Fast

The ideal fasting process is by only consuming water but the important part is keeping the insulin levels low so if you consume something that would keep the insulin low, it is not going to interfere with the benefits of fasting.

**Things that will NOT affect insulin:**

1\. Fiber (green salad)

2\. Fat (MCT Oil, Butter, Coconut Oil, Whole Cream)

3\. Tea / Coffee

4\. Supplements

5\. Green Powder

## Managing Chronic Conditions with Fasting

Prolonged fasting offers significant benefits for managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and degenerative diseases.

**Diabetes Management**

Fasting improves insulin sensitivity and regulates blood sugar levels, which can help mitigate complications associated with diabetes. Research published in _Diabetes Care_ demonstrates that intermittent fasting can enhance insulin sensitivity and lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in individuals with prediabetes.

**Potential Cancer-Fighting Benefits**

Fasting may also have potential in cancer management by inducing ketosis, which deprives cancer cells of glucose needed for growth. A review in _Nature Reviews Cancer_ highlights that fasting can enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation while minimizing their side effects.

***

## Nutrient Optimization During Fasting

While intermittent fasting can be a powerful tool for improving health, ensuring you're still meeting your body's nutritional needs during your eating windows is crucial.

Keeping an eye on consuming adequate amounts of some often-overlooked heroes – namely magnesium, potassium, and B vitamins– is crucial for staying healthy; they’re fundamental for ensuring everything inside us operates correctly.

Fasting may make your body more prone to nutrient deficiencies, particularly if you don't consume a proper diet during your eating windows.

Consider incorporating nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens, nuts, and seeds into your meals to help prevent deficiencies and support overall health.

Additionally, some people may benefit from supplementing with specific nutrients during their fasting journey.

For example, taking a high-quality magnesium supplement before bed can help support restful sleep and reduce muscle cramps, while consuming citrate-rich foods like lemon juice can help counter keto flu symptoms by promoting hydration and electrolyte balance.

## Prolonged Fasting - Build Up Nutrients with Healthy Keto®

An adequate nutrient reserve is essential to a safe prolonged fast. Healthy Keto® is a low-carb, high-fat, moderate-protein diet focusing on high-quality, nutrient-dense foods.

Healthy Keto® emphasizes organic vegetables, full-fat organic dairy, and wild-caught, grass-fed, pasture-raised meat, fish, fowl, and eggs to maximize vitamin and mineral nutrients. Healthy Keto® replaces unhealthy oils like soy, corn, and canola oil with healthier butter, coconut, avocado, olive, and animal fats to help reduce inflammation and support improved nutrient absorption. Dr. Berg’s Healthy Keto® also encourages the consumption of 7 to 10 cups of vegetables daily for adequate vitamins and mineral nutrients.

**Always Start with Intermittent Fasting**

Intermittent fasting serves as a foundational step before transitioning to prolonged fasting for several reasons:

1. **Adaptation to Fasting State:** Intermittent fasting helps your body gradually adapt to periods without food. This adaptation can make the transition to prolonged fasting smoother and more manageable.
2. **Metabolic Flexibility:** Intermittent fasting enhances your body's ability to switch between using glucose and fat as energy sources. This metabolic flexibility is crucial for prolonged fasting, where your body needs to utilize fat stores for energy over extended periods efficiently.
3. **Building Fasting Tolerance:** Starting with intermittent fasting allows you to build knowledge of your hunger signs and learn how your body responds to fasting. This experience is valuable when you extend the fasting duration in prolonged fasting.
4. **Safety and Efficacy:** Gradually increasing fasting duration through intermittent fasting is essential to a safer and more efficient fast than jumping directly into prolonged fasting, which can be more challenging and has a higher risk of adverse effects if not done correctly.

Starting with intermittent fasting prepares your body and mind for the more intensive experience of prolonged fasting, potentially enhancing both the experience and the benefits.

To start intermittent fasting, you can follow these steps:

1. **Choose Your Fasting Plan**: Decide a fasting schedule that suits your lifestyle. Standard plans include the 16:8 method, where you fast for 16 hours and eat during an 8-hour window.
2. **Gradually Increase Fasting Time**: Begin by slowly extending your overnight fast. For example, delay breakfast by an hour and gradually increase until you can comfortably skip it.
3. **Stay Hydrated**: During fasting periods, drink plenty of water and electrolyte water. Black coffee or herbal teas should be consumed in limited amounts, as they can dehydrate you.
4. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to how your body responds. If you experience fatigue or feel unusually cold, these could be signs that you’re advancing too quickly.
5. **Nutrient-Dense Foods**: During your feeding window, choose nutrient-dense foods, such as those on the [Healthy Keto® Approved Foods](https://www.drberg.com/ketosis-approved-foods) list.
6. **Consult Healthcare Providers**: If you have any health conditions or concerns, consult a healthcare provider before starting an intermittent fasting regimen.

## Protective Effects of Fasting on the Brain

Fasting enhances cognitive function and safeguards brain health through several mechanisms. It increases neuronal plasticity by boosting levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which supports neuron growth and survival, leading to improved learning and memory.

Fasting also offers neural protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain. It promotes the production of antioxidant enzymes that neutralize free radicals, protecting brain cells from damage.

Additionally, fasting triggers autophagy, a process that cleanses brain cells by breaking down and recycling damaged proteins and organelles. This "spring cleaning" helps maintain cellular health and may be particularly beneficial in preventing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.

***

## Should I skip breakfast when I'm fasting?

Skipping breakfast can be an excellent way to adjust your body to intermittent fasting and has many benefits. Because eating breakfast every morning can slow your metabolism, those looking to boost theirs may want to skip the first meal of the day.

Eating first thing in the morning also spikes your insulin, which halts the many benefits your body reaps overnight as you don't eat. And third, skipping breakfast can be beneficial because most typical breakfast foods are high in sugar and will cause your blood sugar to crash early in the day.

***

## Should I take BCAAs on Intermittent fasting and Keto while exercising?

This will spike insulin, but it's a minor point since the insulin spike is small. The real question is WHY are you taking it in the first place.

If you are taking it for recovery, then realize that those amino acids take several hours before they are turned into protein and you would be much better off taking B-vitamins (nutritional yeast) and minerals (electrolytes), since they are the cofactors or helps in the repair of muscles and the creation (synthesis) of muscle.

If you are taking BCAA to build muscle realize that intermittent fasting, in general, will already give you a protein-sparing effect and this protects you from the loss of protein. Growth hormones are spiked too, which helps with this.

Autophagy also occurs which is the recycling of proteins from the cell, thus reducing the need for taking extra protein.

## The Adaptation Period of Periodic Fasting

Starting a periodic fasting regimen involves a significant metabolic shift as the body transitions from using glucose to burning fat for fuel. This adaptation process, known as ketosis, typically takes between three to seven days.

**Understanding the Shift to Fat Burning**

Initially, fasting depletes glycogen stores in the liver and muscles. Once these reserves are low, usually within 24-48 hours, the body begins lipolysis, breaking down fat into fatty acids. The liver then converts these fatty acids into ketones, providing an alternative energy source for the brain and organs.

**Navigating Early Side Effects**

During this transition, you may experience temporary side effects, including fatigue, irritability, brain fog, and symptoms akin to the "keto flu." Hypoglycemia, characterized by shakiness, dizziness, and lightheadedness, is also common as insulin levels drop and glucose intake ceases.

These symptoms generally subside within the first week as the body adapts to fat metabolism. Staying hydrated, getting adequate rest, and monitoring your body's responses can help alleviate discomfort during this adaptation phase.

## The Potential Benefits and Risks of Prolonged Fasting

Dr. Berg emphasizes the importance of understanding the benefits and risks of prolonged fasting. Individuals interested in starting prolonged fasting should be well-informed and supervised, especially if they have existing health conditions or concerns.

**The Potential Benefits of Prolonged Fasting**

1. **Cellular Rejuvenation and Autophagy**: Prolonged fasting triggers cellular cleanup processes, removing damaged cells and regenerating new ones.
2. **Supports Digestive Health**: Fasting provides a physiological rest for the digestive system, potentially improving its function upon refeeding.
3. **Fights Inflammation**: It helps reduce inflammation linked to chronic diseases.
4. **Improves Insulin Sensitivity**: Lower risk of insulin resistance, which can help prevent diabetes.
5. **Heart Health**: Linked to a lower risk of heart disease by improving various risk factors.
6. **Anti-Aging Effects**: The autophagy triggered by fasting can have profound anti-aging effects.
7. **Mental Clarity and Cognitive Function**: Some evidence suggests fasting can improve mental clarity and protect against neurodegenerative diseases.
8. **Weight Loss**: Extended periods of fasting push the metabolism to burn stored body fat as a fuel source, supporting maintaining a healthy body weight.

Review the ‘[**6 Stages of Fasting’**](https://youtu.be/HFY-C9rG70E?si=7FIe8JV2AGlPPhsI) video to understand the stages of potential benefits of prolonged fasting.

**The Risks of Prolonged Fasting**

1. **Prolonged Fasting Is Not Suitable for Everyone**:

**(A) The following individuals MUST avoid prolonged fasting:**

1. Pregnant or breastfeeding mothers
2. Children under the age of 18
3. Anyone who is already underweight and needs to gain weight.

**(B) Individuals with the following medical conditions must avoid prolonged fasting or be under consistent medical supervision:**

1. Diabetes
2. Hypoglycemia
3. Eating disorders
4. Cardiovascular disease
5. Kidney problems
6. Any other medical condition.
7. **Potential Nutrient Deficiencies**: Extended fasting without proper planning can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients.
8. **Medication Interactions**: Certain medications, especially those for blood pressure or heart disease, may increase the risk of side effects such as sodium and potassium deficiencies during fasting.
9. **Requires Supervision for Those with Medical Conditions**: If you have underlying health issues, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider before starting prolonged fasting.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider.**

If you want to try prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential. Although some healthcare providers may be unfamiliar with the benefits and only know about the potential risks, it's essential to listen to their concerns and provide them with resources to educate them about the benefits of fasting. If you and your healthcare provider agree that prolonged fasting is safe for your individual health, request nutrient testing before starting, such as a Nutrient Panel Blood Test, to ensure you have the necessary nutrient reserves to do a prolonged fast safely.

Review “[The 5 BIG Prolonged Fasting Mistakes: MUST WATCH](https://youtu.be/j9c6zkXr9U4?si=vQ0pOrnz9gdyj9xD)” before consulting with your healthcare provider to understand more of the risk factors around prolonged fasting.

## The Transition to Ketosis During Fasting

During fasting, glycogen stores are depleted, prompting the body to produce ketones from stored fat. This process, known as ketosis, allows the brain and other organs to use ketones as an alternative fuel source when glucose is scarce.

**Glycogen Depletion and Ketone Production**

Within the first 12 to 24 hours of fasting, glycogen stores are exhausted, leading to lipolysis, where fat is broken down into free fatty acids and glycerol. The liver then converts these fatty acids into ketones through ketogenesis, typically starting around 12 to 24 hours into the fast.

As fasting continues, glucose and insulin levels decrease, prompting the body to use fat for energy. By 12 to 72 hours, approximately 40% of fat is utilized for ketone production. Prolonged fasting promotes adaptation to ketosis, enhancing the body's efficiency in using ketones and fat for energy.

***

## What are important fasting rules?

The 7 most important intermittent fasting rules are as follows:

**1. Hydration is Key**: Drinking water, tea, and coffee while fasting is beneficial. Certain teas can help extend your fast and reduce hunger. Coffee is fine, but avoid excessive consumption.

**2. Supplement Wisely:** Taking supplements like vitamins, electrolytes, trace minerals, nutritional yeast, and omega-3 fatty acids is important while fasting. A green drink without fiber, like wheatgrass juice powder, is acceptable. Avoid protein powders and branched-chain amino acids. Bone broth or MCT oil can be tried but may not suit everyone.

**3. Listen to Your Hunger Cues**: Only eat when you're truly hungry. If you reach your fasting goal and feel like you can go longer, it's okay to extend your fast. However, don’t push yourself to the point of weakness, fatigue, irritability, or dizziness.

**4. Refeed Gradually:** After fasting for 48 hours or more, reintroduce food slowly. Start with a small amount of food and wait before gradually increasing your intake.

**5. Monitor Insulin Resistance:** Your ability to fast can indicate your insulin resistance level. If fasting is easy, your insulin resistance may be improving. Difficulty fasting may suggest you still have insulin resistance and need more time and effort.

**6. Combine with Healthy Keto:** Pair intermittent fasting with a healthy keto diet. This combination helps keep insulin levels low and offers numerous health benefits. A high-carb diet could undermine the benefits of intermittent fasting.

## What are the antiviral effects of autophagy?

Autophagy, meaning "self-eat," is a bodily mechanism that breaks down and recycles damaged proteins and has unique antiviral effects. It helps eliminate:

\- Viruses

\- Bacteria

\- Fungus

\- Candida

\- Biofilms/nanobacteria

Autophagy works with the immune system to defend against harmful microbes. However, some viruses can resist autophagy depending on immune strength and other factors.

Other effective remedies for viruses include:

\- Colloidal silver

\- Elderberry

\- Garlic

\- Olive leaf

\- Zinc

## What are the benefits of fasting to boost brain power?

If you have brain fog, memory problems, and mental fatigue, fasting can benefit you. Fasting can stimulate a certain protein called BDNF by up to 400%. This protein can resist the oxidative stress that comes from too frequently eating, as this can cause significant insulin spikes. Fasting can also trigger neurogenesis, which helps regrow nerve cells and greatly benefits the brain by creating new neural pathways, increasing mitochondria, increasing stress resistance, and getting rid of brain fog.

## What are the benefits of intermittent fasting for healthy skin?

Intermittent fasting has many great benefits for the skin. For instance, it can delay vascular cell deterioration while preventing oxidative stress. It can also stimulate autophagy (cell repair) and boost stem cell production. It also lowers inflammation because glycogen in the skin is reduced. Anti-aging effects can be seen in the skin through fasting as well, because more elastin is produced by the body.

***

## What are the detoxification benefits of dry fasting?

Dry fasting offers significant detoxification benefits compared to water fasting. By initiating a process called autophagy, dry fasting facilitates the breakdown and recycling of damaged cellular components, thereby reducing inflammation and enhancing overall health.

**Enhancing Detoxification**

Dry fasting enhances detoxification by kick-starting autophagy, akin to a cellular "spring cleaning." This process helps remove metabolic waste and can improve health by reducing inflammation.

**The Sleep-Dry Fasting Connection**

Dry fasting can mimic some of the reparative effects of sleep. Just as rest promotes cellular repair, dry fasting supports cellular rejuvenation, making it a potent cleansing method with additional benefits.

**Endogenous Water Production**

During dry fasting, the body produces endogenous water through the metabolism of fat reserves. This internal hydration aids in detoxification, as it helps flush out toxins and supports cellular function.

**Caution and Preparation**

While dry fasting showcases remarkable adaptability and detoxification, it requires careful management to avoid dehydration and other health issues. Proper preparation and guidance are essential to safely harness its benefits.

## What are the different stages of fasting?

**Dr. Berg Nutritionals does not encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provides this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.**

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast. If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

The six stages of fasting:

Stage 1: 8-14 hours

• Stable blood sugar levels

• Using up stored sugar and sugar in the blood

• At 10 hours—the muscles use about 50% glucose and 50% fat (you’re starting to transition to fat-burning)

Stage 2: 14-24 hours

• Starting to get into ketosis

• Fewer cravings

• More energy

• Improved mood

• Improved cognitive function

Stage 3: 24-36 hours

• Full ketosis and fat burning

• The liver is making ketones

• Decreased appetite

• Decreased ghrelin

• Increased BDNF (new brain cells)

Stage 4: 36-48 hours

• Autophagy

• Kill cancer cells

• Decreased oxidative stress

• Decreased misfolded proteins

• Increased memory

Stage 5: 48-60 hours

• Insulin sensitivity super boost

• More autophagy

• Less inflammation

• Atrophy healing

• Protein sparing

Stage 6: 60-72 hours

• Immune system regeneration

• Spike in immune stem cells

• A 2014 study demonstrated that a 72 hour fast led to a complete rejuvenation of the immune system, and people on chemotherapy had less damage

## What are the intermittent fasting patterns for different body situations?

**1. Growth hormone**

This is an anti-aging hormone that helps burn fat and preserve muscle. Fasting, exercise, and sleep can spike growth hormone.

• Increases at 12+ hrs.

**2. Autophagy**

This is a condition where your body is recycling damaged proteins and clearing out microbes.

• Increases at 18+ hrs.

**3. Inflammation**

You can really see a drop in inflammation when you do OMAD (one meal a day). This also applies to sickness and speeding up the recovery process.

• A drop in inflammation may happen at 23+ hrs.

**4. Cancer**

With cancer, consider doing OMAD with periodic prolonged fasting. This helps lower glucose and glutamine. Also, when you do eat, consume a lot of cruciferous vegetables.

• These effects may happen after 23+ hrs.

**5. Stem cell**

This is a cell that hasn’t turned into anything yet. When you do a periodic fast for 72 hours, you’re going to stimulate some stem cells. This can help build new tissue.

• These effects may happen after 72+ hrs.

**6. Stubborn weight**

If you have a really stubborn weight situation, consider doing OMAD every other day. Make sure you’re getting your nutrients.

• For stubborn weight, try eating one meal every 48 hours.

**7. Diabetes**

This is a problem with excess sugar. With diabetes, you can really help the blood sugar situation with fasting. The problem is that you must check your blood sugars routinely, and talk to your doctor about adjusting your medications. Check with your doctor and fast gradually.

## What are the key nutrients and herbs for intermittent fasting?

The longer the fast you undertake, the more important your nutrient intake is. If you already have a nutrient deficiency, a long fast can aggravate it, causing symptoms like dizziness, feeling faint or tired, rashes, muscle cramps, palpitations, or chills.

Taking nutrients or herbs goes against the true definition of fasting, which is drinking only water, eating nothing, and not taking any nutrients or herbs. But, there are not enough calories involved in taking nutrients or herbs to effect the benefits of fasting. Some key nutrients for fasting include B vitamins, trace minerals, vitamins D and C, and electrolytes. Green tea, garlic, wheatgrass juice powder , and turmeric are all good herbs to consume on a fast.

## What are the least effective fasting patterns for beginners?

### **The Least Effective Fasting Patterns for Beginners**

While intermittent fasting can be a game-changer for many people, not all fasting patterns are created equal. Some methods may be too extreme or unsustainable for beginners, leading to frustration and potential health risks.

Choosing a fasting pattern that aligns with your goals, lifestyle, and individual needs is important. Here are two fasting methods that may not be the best choice for those just starting out:

#### **The Five and Two Diet's Limited Ketosis Impact**

The five-and-two diet, also known as the 5:2 diet, involves eating normally for five days a week and restricting calorie intake to 500-600 calories on the other two non-consecutive days.

While this method may lead to some weight loss, it has limitations when it comes to achieving ketosis, a metabolic state where your body burns fat for fuel.

To enter ketosis, you typically consume fewer than 50 grams of carbohydrates daily for several days. With the five-and-two diet, the fasting days may not be long enough or consistent enough to trigger this fat-burning state.

As a result, beginners may not experience the full range of benefits associated with intermittent fasting, such as increased energy and improved mental clarity.

#### **Alternative Day Fasting's Sustainability Concerns**

Alternative day fasting (ADF) is another popular method that involves alternating between "fast" days, on which you consume only 25% of your normal calorie intake, and "feast" days, on which you eat without restriction.

While some studies have shown that ADF can lead to weight loss and improved health markers, it may not be the most sustainable approach for beginners.

The drastic calorie restriction on fasting days can be challenging to stick to long-term, leading to feelings of deprivation and even binge eating on feast days. This yo-yo effect can make establishing healthy eating habits difficult and may lead to weight regain over time.

Additionally, the constant fluctuation in calorie intake can be stressful on the body and may not be suitable for those with certain health conditions or a history of disordered eating.

For beginners, a more moderate and consistent approach to fasting may be a better choice for long-term success.

### **Recommended Fasting Patterns for Optimal Benefits**

Finding the right approach to intermittent fasting is key to unlocking its full potential. While some methods may be too extreme for beginners, several fasting patterns offer a more sustainable and effective way to reap the benefits of this lifestyle.

Here are three recommended fasting methods that have been shown to deliver optimal results:

#### **The 18/6 Fasting Pattern**

The 18/6 fasting pattern, or the Leangains protocol, involves fasting for 18 hours and eating within a 6-hour window each day. For example, you might finish your last meal at 8 pm and not eat again until 2 pm the following day.

This method is popular among those looking to build muscle and lose fat, as it allows for more flexibility in meal timing and macronutrient intake.

Fasting for an extended period also gives your body ample time to enter a fat-burning state and experience the benefits of [increased growth hormone levels](https://www.drberg.com/blog/increase-growth-hormone-as-you-age) and [autophagy, a cellular cleanup process](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-real-reason-why-autophagy-exists) that helps remove damaged proteins and organelles.

#### **The 20/4 Fasting Strategy**

The 20/4 fasting strategy may be a good fit for those looking for a more aggressive approach. This method involves fasting for 20 hours and eating within a 4-hour window daily.

While this may sound intense, many people find that the longer fasting helps them feel more focused and energized throughout the day.

The 4-hour eating window also allows for larger, more satisfying meals, which can be especially appealing for those who enjoy the social aspect of dining.

Research has shown that the 20/4 method can be highly effective for weight loss and improving markers of metabolic health, such as insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control. It may also offer cognitive benefits, such as improved brain function and memory.

## What are the most common mistakes that people make on intermittent fasts?

Intermittent fasting provides a ton of health benefits. But some common intermittent fasting mistakes could cause it to be more difficult than it should be. For example, starting to quick and fasting for too long instead of slowly adjusting your eating window will cause many people to quit. Intaking more potassium, B vitamins and trace minerals can help with this.

Overindulging in carbs during an eating window will also make fasting more difficult as it spikes your insulin levels. Not eating enough nutrients or consuming low-quality ingredients during your eating window will also ruin your fasting experience. Finally, not consuming enough fat during your meals causes you to feel much hungrier during your fast, and can make you want to quit.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/mistakes-with-intermittent-fasting-that-ruin-your-results)

***

## What are the only two foods that don’t trigger insulin?

Fat and fiber. Now I'm not talking about the fiber in whole grains or added synthetic fibers. I'm talking about fiber from vegetable and then fat as a pure fat.

**What food combinations would be a good combination to consume both fiber and fat if you're trying to keep your insulin low?** Well, what about a salad with olive oil? That would be a good one. Or maybe celery with peanut butter. Or even more tasty yet, some raw cream whipped into whipped cream and then some blueberries which has some fiber in it. These are just things that you can add to your diet either as a food or dessert. That will definitely help you keep that insulin lowered in addition to other benefits.

***

## What are the potential side effects of fasting?

The side effects of fasting occur primarily during the transition phase from eating to consuming nothing. Potential side effects include a spike in uric acid, feeling cold, moodiness, headaches, increased stomach acid, nausea when eating, fainting (if prolonged fasting is done too quickly), and hair loss. However, if you push through the symptoms and start the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting correctly, they shouldn't be a significant problem.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/potential-benefits-and-side-effects-of-intermittent-fasting-drberg)

***

## What can I do for shakiness while fasting?

Shakiness during fasting often results from rapid adjustments in blood sugar levels. To address this, consider gradually easing into fasting rather than making abrupt changes, particularly if you are new to intermittent fasting or ketogenic diets. Allow your body to adapt at its own pace.

Additionally, ensure your carbohydrate intake remains low when you are not fasting. High carb consumption can prolong the adaptation period and exacerbate low blood sugar symptoms. Maintaining a consistent, low-carb diet will help stabilize blood sugar levels and ease the transition.

***

## What can I do if I'm extremely hungry on Intermittent Fasting?

1\. Go slower and gradually ease into it.

2\. Increase fat in the meal or increase more protein.

3\. Decrease carbs (20-50g/day). If your carbs are too high, you'll never get into ketosis.

4\. Increase your vegetable intake (7-10 cups) to get your potassium and magnesium.

5\. Add apple cider vinegar to your meals.

6\. If you have to snack, consume fat as your snack.

**It takes 4-5 days to start getting into ketosis.**

## What can you do if you’re no longer losing weight while fasting postpartum?

**When you actually go through pregnancy or actually deliver, you have this spike of estrogen that pops up. It interferes with your metabolism. Estrogen does contribute to certain types of fat.**

**I would work on getting into what's called keto adaptation a little bit more to the point where it's easier to do fasting.** That does take weeks, but it's dependent on how many carbs that you eat when you eat. So maybe finding substitutes for those carbs because the problem is that all it takes is a little bit of carbs to knock you out of fat burning for a longer period of time.

**The other thing is adding in twice a week high intensity interval training just to start to stimulate the exercise, but don't do it more than twice a week. But when you do it, like do it really good. In between that, do long walks and then try to get an extra hour of sleep.**

**To make fasting easier, sometimes it's helpful if when you do eat, you just add a little more fat to go longer.** But over time, it's gonna be easier to fast. If you're having any problems fasting for a longer period of time, all that means is that you have to either lower your carbs when you eat or just give it more time and then build up to that.

## What causes phlegm while fasting?

I wouldn't worry too much about that. It could be one of the transition things you're going through. Of course, phlegm is part of the immune reaction. It could be just something that you can compensate with taking something like Spanish black radish or maybe something that's high in sulfur to help clean out your glands and things like that.

***

## What could cause heart palpitations while fasting?

Heart palpitations during fasting may be caused by deficiencies in key nutrients, particularly potassium and vitamin B1. These water-soluble nutrients are not stored in the body for long periods and can become depleted, leading to elevated pulse rates. To address this, consider supplementing with electrolytes containing potassium and B vitamins. This approach should help mitigate the issue effectively.

***

## What do I do if I'm experiencing false hunger cravings on Intermittent Fasting?

Hunger during fasts is due to higher levels of cortisol, the adrenal hormone. Cortisol naturally spikes at 8 a.m. due to the circadian rhythm. This isn't caused by a lack of food but by a temporary hormonal shift that raises and then lowers blood sugar levels. The hunger pangs typically subside within 30-60 minutes. The longer you fast, the better your body will adjust, and the hunger pangs should subside.

***

## What does a 24-Hour fast do?

Not consuming calories for 24 hours forces your metabolism to utilize stored body fat as a primary fuel source.

Once the liver depletes all the glucose and starts burning fat, ketone levels rise and provide your cells and tissues with energy—this metabolic state is known as ketosis.

***

## What foods should I eat to make fasting easier?

When you’re fasting, anything you consume other than water will break your fast to some degree. But, some food items you can consume will have a very minor effect on your ability to get back into fasting. The biggest things that will break your fast are refined carbs or sugar.

Making sure you have enough nutrients while fasting is critical, as this will make it easier. Some things you can consume to make fasting easier are MCT oil (can add it to coffee), electrolytes (be sure there are no added sugars), probiotics, B vitamins, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, sea salt, amino acid blends, and kombucha tea.

## What happens if you fast while pregnant?

Fasting while pregnant can result in a calorie and nutrient deficit that can negatively impact mother and child. Lack of adequate nutrition during pregnancy can interfere with normal fetal development and may increase the risk of neurological, hormonal, and metabolic complications.

***

## What happens with a body during a fast?

There are a wide range of benefits that the body experiences during a fast. After about 12 hours, the body begins to produce more growth hormone, which helps boost fat-burning, assists with protein synthesis, benefits joints, and can even have some anti-aging effects.

After about 18 hours of fasting, the body begins a process known as autophagy, which recycles old and damaged proteins and cells, turning them into new ones. After a day of fasting, the body will begin to burn fat instead of glygogen, antioxidant and oxygen reserves will increase, the cardiovascular system becomes more efficient, alongside many more benefits. Fasting over 48 or 72 hours can result in the production of more stem cells and better immune function. However, you should never begin a prolonged fast without consulting a medical professional first.

***

## What is a Prolonged Fasting?

Prolonged fasting refers to not eating food for extended periods, typically 48 to 72 hours or longer. Depending on individual goals and health conditions, it may extend to a week or more.

Fasting to prolonged fasting can be thought of similarly to walking and running. Fasting from your last meal of the day, overnight to the first meal of the next, is something we all do without much thought. Walking and running are things an able-bodied person can typically do without much thought.

Intermittent fasting is more like walking or running for regular exercise. There is more thought into when and how long you will perform the exercise, and specific goals are made around it. OMAD is like a 20 km or 12.4-mile walk or run. While a 20 km walk or run and OMAD intermittent fasting are challenging, they are doable for many who have planned, prepared and practiced shorter distances or fasting durations.

Prolonged fasting is comparable to marathon walking or running. Proper planning, preparation, practice, health monitoring, and recovery are essential to fasting and a marathon. If a marathon (26.2 miles or 42.2 km) seems daunting, you should think similarly of a 48- to 72-hour prolonged fast. Longer prolonged fasts should be viewed as entering an ultramarathon. The longer you go, the more preparation, planning, practice, health monitoring, and recovery are needed.

This information is provided from [Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz\&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do _not_ encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provides this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast. If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

## What is an autophagy on steroids?

Water fasting is when a person only consumes liquids for a period of time. When a person does dry fasting, they’re not consuming food or liquids. One of the biggest benefits of fasting is autophagy. Autophagy is a condition where your body recycles damaged proteins and turns them into new enzymes and structural proteins. Autophagy also helps you get rid of pathogens. Detoxification is just as important, if not more important, in some cases, as getting plenty of nutrients. One of the big purposes of sleep is to detoxify your cells. Fasting, especially dry fasting, mimics a lot of the benefits of sleep.

It’s important to note that about eight to ten percent of the water you get is produced by your own cells, which also enhances detoxification. But, if you drink a lot of water, your body doesn’t get a chance to produce metabolic water.

Dry fasting is essentially enhanced autophagy. Anything you can do to remove extra waste from the body is a great thing, especially for longevity.

**Top benefits of dry fasting:**

• It can help remove intracellular toxicity

• It can help strengthen biochemical machines

• It can help improve mitochondrial function

• It’s a strong epigenetic stimulus

• It can mimic some of the benefits of a deep sleep

## What is the best intermittent fasting schedule for breastfeeding mothers?

Intermittent fasting isn’t recommended for breastfeeding moms. Pregnancy can contribute to nutrient deficiencies in the mother, and practicing intermittent fasting while breastfeeding can worsen potentially pre-existing nutrient deficiencies, which can impact the health of the mother and baby.

***

## What is the best time of day to break a fast?

One of the biggest questions surrounding Intermittent Fasting is when to break the fast. However, the truth is that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.

The best time of day to break a fast is wholly based on an individual's schedule, lifestyle, and preferences. Some people prefer to break their fast in the morning, while others prefer to do so in the afternoon or evening. The timing of the feeding window will also depend on the length of the fast.

Certain feeding times may have greater results for some individuals, but this doesn't mean that it's the best time for everyone. So, the key to success with intermittent fasting is finding a feeding schedule that works for you and your lifestyle.

In this video, Dr. Berg presents evidence that feeding in the morning _may_ promote positive results, but he acknowledges that the results may vary by individual. [https://youtu.be/GW3UMJOJs9E?si=bBa6Ty4bAzzvdOgy](https://youtu.be/GW3UMJOJs9E?si=bBa6Ty4bAzzvdOgy)

Ultimately, listen to your body, experiment with different feeding times, and find the one that works best for you. Remember, the most important thing is to make sure you're getting the nutrients your body needs to function properly, whether it's in the morning, afternoon, or evening.

## What is the fasting mimicking diet?

**FMD, developed by Valter Longo, is a diet where you basically consume 800 calories for five days and then go back to regular eating for the rest of the month. This will be done for 3 months. Problems with the Fasting Mimicking Diet program will also be tackled.**

**Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD)**

Macros: • 9%

Protein • 44%

Fat • 47% Carbs

**Diet Foods:**

• Vegetables Soup

• Energy Drink

• Energy Bar

• Chip Snack

• Tea

• Supplement

**Problem with Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD):**

1\. Overpriced

2\. Contains sugar – low-quality foods that stimulate insulin

3\. Low-calorie diet – It is not fasting but it is a fasting-mimicking program.

4\. Very painful - People who are doing this are suffering because they are not going into a gradual adaptation process.

5\. This does not teach healthy lifestyle.

## What is the relationship between glycogen stores and electrolytes when doing Keto and Intermittent fasting?

**Glycogen is series of glucose molecules linked together as a group. When you have more glycogen, you are going to hold more water. Doing ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting will shrink down glycogen that could cause the symptoms in transitioning from sugar burning to fat burning.**

**Problems of Deplete Minerals:**

• Sodium – Weaker muscles, keto flu, dizziness, low blood pressure

• Potassium – Fatigue, Sleep problems, higher pulse rate. Potassium is needed for energy and also calmness when sleeping.

• Calcium – Cramps

• Magnesium – Sleep problem, cramps, heart rhythm

***

## What is your advice for someone who has to take meds at a certain time while doing IF?

If you're taking medication while practicing intermittent fasting, it's crucial to prioritize liver and kidney health. While specific timing for medication intake varies, supporting your body with protective nutrients like milk thistle is beneficial. Milk thistle contains powerful phytonutrients that help mitigate the potential side effects of medications by reducing free radical damage and toxicity. This plant is well-known for its ability to protect against various toxins, making it a valuable supplement for those on medication.

***

## What quantity of vegetables should I consume while doing OMAD?

When following OMAD (One Meal a Day), the body becomes more efficient at recycling nutrients, so the typical recommendation of 8-10 cups of vegetables may not be necessary. Instead, focus on consuming smaller, high-quality portions of vegetables. For salads, aim for a moderate amount, while for denser vegetables like cabbage or broccoli, around 4 cups should suffice. Adjust based on your appetite and nutritional needs.

***

## What sugar or carbs can I eat on intermittent fasting?

Intermittent fasting doesn’t necessarily require you to not eat carbs or sugar. You can eat them if you want, although it will not be effective.

Doing intermittent fasting and the keto diet together brings the best benefits. In which case you should only eat 20 to 50 g net carbs a day, meaning total carbs minus fiber.

If you crave sweetness, check for some safe keto-friendly alternatives like stevia or monk fruit.

***

## What supplements or nutrients can disrupt a fast?

Supplements that can disrupt a fast typically include those with significant caloric content, such as protein powders (e.g., whey protein) and sugary vitamin drinks. In contrast, most vitamins and minerals without added calories, sugar, or protein generally do not interfere with fasting. To maintain the integrity of your fast, avoid supplements that contain these ingredients.

***

## What types of fats are suitable for a keto diet and intermittent fasting?

Consuming healthy fats on the keto diet and during intermittent fasting is crucial to keep your digestive system healthy. The best fats to consume are in the following foods:

1\. Coconut oil

2\. Butter

3\. Olives

4\. Avocado

5\. Egg yolks

6\. Nuts and nut butter

7\. Seeds and seed butter

8\. Animal fats (grass-fed)

9\. Fish and fish oil

Bad fats should be avoided, as they will be harmful to weight loss efforts and overall health. Some bad fats include soy, corn, cottonseed, and canola.

Fats you can use in moderation, but should not rely on too heavily are safflower and sunflower seed oil.

## What will happen with my body after a week of fasting?

If you start cutting carbs, you could start losing a lot of fluid. Initially, a person could easily lose 13 pounds (5.89kg) in one week. This depends on how much water weight you have.

One pound of fat is 3500 calories. An average person might burn roughly 2000 calories in a day. So, in theory, if everything goes perfectly, a person could lose 0.5-0.7 pounds per day while fasting. This would come out to just under 5 pounds (2.2kg) per week with fasting.

**But, there are a lot of variables that can affect this, including:**

• Exercise

• Stress

• Sleep

• Age

• Metabolism

• History of consuming a lot of carbs

• Health issues

When you start fasting, you can stimulate growth hormone. Growth hormone protects against the loss of protein. Typically, the body doesn’t use protein as fuel. It uses the fat fuel until that’s gone, then it uses muscle.

Let’s say someone is a bodybuilder, or they have a good amount of muscle on their body, and they’re exercising. But after they start the week fast, they don’t exercise. Potentially, their muscles could shrink because it’s the exercise that keeps the muscles stimulated and growing. A good indicator to know if you’re fasting correctly is being able to exercise without feeling too weak and tired.

If you’re fasting, but you don’t have any energy, and you can’t do intense exercise, you may need more electrolytes. It’s also important to make sure you’re taking enough sea salt regardless of whether or not you’re eating. Green powder drinks, B vitamins (nutritional yeast), and trace minerals may also be beneficial while fasting. Some people think they need to load up on carbs to spike insulin to help their muscles grow. But, insulin comes with a package. And, insulin is also triggered by protein.

So, a better solution may be to have more protein instead of carbs. If you’re trying to lose weight, this isn’t a good idea. But if you’re trying to build muscle, it may be a better option.

## What's a correct supplementation for intermittent fasting?

Supplementation of nutrients while fasting is essential for maintaining optimal health. Here is a list of the fundamental nutrient supplements to take while fasting:

1. **Electrolytes with Sea Salt**

Using electrolytes with sea salt while fasting is beneficial for several reasons:

1. **Hydration Maintenance**: Sea salt contains essential trace minerals that help maintain hydration levels. This is crucial during fasting, as the risk of dehydration increases due to the diuretic effect of fasting, which leads to increased urine production.
2. **Electrolyte Balance**: Electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and magnesium, found in sea salt, are vital for maintaining proper electrolyte balance. This balance is crucial for various bodily functions, including muscle contraction and nerve function.
3. **Prevention of Muscle Cramps and Fatigue**: Adequate levels of minerals and electrolytes can help prevent common fasting-related issues such as muscle cramps and fatigue, making the fasting experience more sustainable and safer.
4. **Supports Energy Production**: Electrolytes play a crucial role in supporting the energy-making processes during fasting by maintaining proper cellular function and overall bodily operations.
5. **B Vitamin Complex**: The complete B vitamin complex, including B12 and folate, is essential for energy production and maintaining proper nervous system function.
6. **Trace Minerals**

Certain trace minerals are vital during prolonged fasting due to their roles in maintaining bodily functions and preventing deficiencies that can be exacerbated during fasting periods. Here are some essential trace minerals and their significance:

1. **Zinc**: A deficiency in zinc can impact overall health, and maintaining adequate levels helps support enzyme functions and immune health during fasting.
2. **Iron**: Adequate iron levels are necessary to prevent anemia and ensure oxygen is efficiently transported throughout the body.
3. **Selenium**: Maintaining selenium levels helps support immune function and protect cells from oxidative stress during fasting.
4. **Iodine**: Adequate iodine is necessary to maintain metabolic rate and support overall thyroid health.

A complete trace mineral complex supplement with those listed above is critical to a safe fast.

## What's a perfect fasting window?

Research has found the optimum time of fasting is between 18-24 hours. So if your time of eating (window of eating) is 6 hours, and let's say you eat at 12 noon and then again at 6, this gives 6 hours of eating and 18 hours of fasting. Then, you can slowly adjust your body and graduate to shorter eating windows, until you are fasting for long periods with no discomfort.

If your metabolism is slow and you suffer from insulin resistance, you may benefit greatly from eating only one meal a day, or OMAD. This, in combination with proper sleep and exercise (particularly HIIT training), can boost weight loss efforts, improve insulin sensitivity, and support overall health.

## What's the biggest benefit of fasting?

One of the best benefits of fasting is a process known as autophagy. Autophagy is a process where cells recycle damaged components and eliminate pathogenic microbes like mold, viruses, fungi, bacteria, and candida. This mechanism is considered the ultimate anti-aging strategy, as it involves lysosomes, the cell's mini-garbage disposals, which clear out waste and send the particles to the liver for fuel or the creation of new cell parts.

***

## What's the difference between dry and wet fasting?

**What is dry fasting?** Dry fasting is fasting (not eating) without any water or liquids of any kind.

**What is water fasting?** Water fasting is when you’re fasting, but you’re drinking water.

**There are also two types of dry fasting:**

**Soft dry fasting:** This is when you’re allowed to use water when you brush your teeth or take a shower.

**Hard dry fasting:** This is when you do not expose any part of your body to water at all.

The body can typically only go around three days without water. But, your body will go a lot longer if you’re just restricting food and not water because you still have a fat reserve to live off of.

There is no research or studies comparing dry fasting and wet fasting side by side. But, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s a bad thing or that you won’t get amazing results. In theory, dry fasting may work well for some people for one day. If you wanted to try dry fasting, I wouldn’t go longer than one day. Then, you can compare a day of doing a dry fast and a day of doing a wet fast and see what works best for you.

## What's the difference between fasting and starvation?

Fasting is when you deplete the glycogen reserves (stored sugar in the liver and the muscles) and fat for energy. Starvation differs because it means you have already depleted your glycogen and fat reserves, and the body is now breaking down muscles and organs are breaking down for fuel.

Fasting is healthy because it helps your body repair damaged cells while purging necessary fat and glycogen reserves. Starvation is extremely damaging and causes long-term health problems and even death if left unaddressed.

***

## What's the difference between ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting?

The ketogenic diet (keto) and intermittent fasting are two different dietary approaches with different focuses. Keto is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that aims to induce ketosis, where the body burns fat for fuel, by strictly reducing sugar and carb intake. In contrast, intermittent fasting centers on the timing of meals, alternating between periods of eating and fasting, without specifying what foods to eat.

While keto requires significant changes to food choices to maintain specific macronutrient ratios, intermittent fasting offers flexibility and can be combined with various diets, including keto. Combining keto and intermittent fasting can have many health benefits, including weight loss and autophagy (cellular renewal).

***

## What's the relation between extreme hunger and intermittent fasting?

Hunger is a great indicator of whether you are doing intermittent correctly. If the hunger is too high and severe WITH additional blood sugar issues (dizziness, lightheadedness, irritability, sugar cravings, and brain fog), then you need to cut back and add a meal or add more fat with a meal.

The other thing to do is add electrolytes to your fasting period and some bone broth as this will make it easier to go from 1 meal to the next. If you just have some hunger and it's not too severe - ride the wave and keep going.

***

## What's the worst type of intermittent fasting?

Alternate day fasting is when you would fast for one day, and then the next day, you would eat whatever you want. This is an ineffective method of fasting because it is inconsistent, so it makes it difficult for your body to reap the benefits of fasting. Another ineffective method of fasting is the 5:2 method,

With the 5:2 fasting pattern, you can eat whatever you want for five days, and then you fast for two days. This is a poor fasting method because it is essentially just calorie restricting two days a week, and will not actually benefit you in the many ways a 16:8 or 20:4 fasting pattern will.

***

## When should I exercise during fasting?

Typically a big mistake people make is adding too many things like keto, intermittent fasting, and exercise too fast. Maybe they’re trying to go to two meals a day right away and are exercising on top of that. This could be too much too soon.

A good indicator to know if you’re ready for exercise is how you feel when you start to exercise.

You may not want to do things like cardio or interval training early in the morning if you’re fasting. You could deplete your glycogen reserve, and if you’re not adapted, you’re going to get really hungry. You may want to exercise just before your meal, in-between your first and second meal, or just after your last meal. Some people may benefit from adding more protein to their diet when they workout.

Some people may also need to add a meal when they work out if they are too hungry and haven’t fully adapted yet. Another thing that may help is creatine. Creatine could potentially help improve recovery and increase muscle mass. Creatine doesn’t have to be taken with a meal.

***

## Which supplements or beverages should I consume while fasting?

While fasting, consider adding apple cider vinegar to your routine, as it boosts energy and enhances insulin sensitivity. Mix a tablespoon with water, and add lemon juice for its citrate content, which may help prevent kidney stones.

It's also essential to ensure adequate sea salt intake, especially if you're on a one-meal-a-day plan, to avoid muscle weakness and sleep disturbances. Additionally, using an electrolyte powder rich in potassium and B vitamins is beneficial. These vitamins are crucial for energy production, particularly on a low-carb, high-fat diet.

***

## Who shouldn't do intermittent fasting?

Certain individuals should avoid intermittent fasting due to specific health conditions. Pregnant women should maintain a nutrient-dense diet with three meals a day without restricting calories. Nursing mothers must ensure they receive all necessary nutrients to avoid deprivation. Individuals with neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, should consume three meals daily with a low carbohydrate intake. Babies and small children should avoid sweets and maintain regular meals.

Those with eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia should also refrain from intermittent fasting. For people with hypoglycemia, intermittent fasting can be beneficial if introduced gradually with nutrient-dense foods to stabilize blood sugar levels. Anxiety can decrease with intermittent fasting as it supports adrenal gland function, and it can also improve sleep disorders by enhancing brain health and reducing the need for sleep. Women with hormonal issues, including PCOS, may benefit from intermittent fasting due to its positive effects on hormone regulation.

***

## Who shouldn’t do OMAD?

Those who exercise heavily or have a history of eating disorders shouldn’t practice OMAD. In addition, pregnancy and breastfeeding are periods of increased caloric need, and it’s not recommended that pregnant or breastfeeding mothers follow OMAD or any other intermittent fasting schedule.

***

## Why do I have digestive issues when I’m breaking my fast?

This could happen because, basically, your digestive system has gone to sleep and it hasn’t woken yet. You don’t want to eat a large meal after a long fast because you will overload your system. You need to start small.

After a long fast, you may also want to take certain things, such as:

* Apple cider vinegar (ACV) or betaine hydrochloride
* Bile salts
* Enzymes
* Probiotics

Foods to avoid after a long fast:

* Nuts and nut butters
* Red meat
* Raw cruciferous vegetables
* Dairy products

***

## Why do people fail with intermittent fasting?

There are a few reasons someone might fail at intermittent fasting. The first is that they never even start, because they are afraid of starvation and extreme discomfort as they do not understand how well the body adapts to fasting. Some are too used to eating multiple times a day and cannot find the motivation to cut down their eating window.

Others start the intermittent fasting diet but quit after the first few days because they feel worse. This is because they do not understand it takes some time to adjust. These early transitional symptoms can be alleviated by taking potassium, sodium, and B1. The final reason people quit is because they are not losing weight. In this instance, it is important to focus on the many other positive benefits fasting has provided you, like improved energy, decreased cravings, less hunger, and increased mental clarity.

## Why does fasting lower your thyroid hormone T3 a little bit?

Sometimes, going on a fast can lower a thyroid hormone called T3. This is the active form of the thyroid hormone.

The pituitary communicates to the thyroid through a hormone called the thyroid stimulating hormone. One of the main ways hypothyroidism is diagnosed is by looking at the thyroid stimulating hormone. When you’re fasting and doing the healthy keto diet, you won’t see a change in the thyroid stimulating hormone. So, you are not going to have a true hypothyroid condition.

The thyroid releases T4, which is the inactive form of the thyroid hormone. To become activated, it has to work through the liver and into the kidney. It converts from T4 to T3 (the active form). There is also something called reverse T3, which is the inactive version of T3. What determines the rate and ratio of this conversion of T4 to T3 or reverse T3 is the metabolic need.

When you do a fast, you may see a slight decrease in T3. But, you will see an increase in the reverse T3. You’re body is becoming more efficient with its fuel, so the need for the active form of the thyroid hormone is going to be slightly less. The body will then put some of that hormone into a reserve until you need it.

**Situations where you could see higher amounts of reverse T3:**

**1. When you’re doing fasting**

**2. When you’re recovering from:**

• A stroke

## Why is the blood glucose level higher during fasting than feeding?

Blood glucose levels may be higher while fasting than when you are feeding. Below are some potential reasons why. Please consult with a medical professional to determine if an underlying medical condition may affect your individual health outcomes. Dawn phenomenon: This is a natural rise in blood glucose levels in the early morning hours, a process regulated by the release of counter-regulatory hormones like cortisol, growth hormone, and glucagon. If the fast ends in the morning, this could contribute to higher glucose levels, but it's a normal part of your body's function.

Gluconeogenesis: The liver produces glucose through gluconeogenesis to maintain blood sugar levels. This process can happen while feeding but is most increased at the 12-24 hour point of a fast, sometimes leading to a temporary increase in blood glucose.

Insulin resistance: Fasting can temporarily increase insulin resistance, which may result in higher blood glucose levels when the fast ends.

Stress response: Fasting is a form of stress on the body, which can trigger the release of stress hormones like cortisol. It's important to acknowledge that this can raise blood sugar levels, but it's a normal part of fasting.

Diet: Many foods have a glucose-lowering effect that may reduce blood sugars during feeding.

Individual variation: Some people may experience a paradoxical increase in blood glucose during fasting due to their unique physiology or underlying health conditions.

## Will bulletproof coffee block my autophagy?

If you make bulletproof coffee with small amounts of additives, like 1 tablespoon of mct oil, 1 tablespoon of butter, this should be fine. It may inhibit the autophagy for a little bit, but it will kick back in shortly after.

Now, if you do half-and-half it may cause more difficulty due to some content of carbs and protein.

Autophagy is a state when you are in fasting mode and the body starts repairing and recycling its damaged proteins and microbes; in that state the need for vitamins and nutrients goes way down.

## Will fasting help treat STDs?

There’s a 2014 study about alternate day fasting – 12 weeks helped salmonella-infected mice clear pathogenic bacteria.

**Alternate day fasting is when you eat what you want every other day and on the days that you are fasting, you reduce the calorie intake. In dealing with bacteria and viruses in remission, here are things to consider:**

1\. Intermittent fasting restores microbe diversity in the gut – when you do intermittent fasting, it will strengthen the immune system.

2\. Autophagy – 18+ hours

3\. Vitamin D – Sun

## Will fasting help with chronic inflammation?

Inflammation serves to repair injuries and fight infections, but chronic inflammation, unlike acute inflammation, provides no long-term benefits and can cause various health issues such as scar tissue formation and insulin resistance. Chronic inflammation, often associated with autoimmune conditions, can be mitigated through fasting, which turns off inflammation-related genes and supports adrenal health. Intermittent fasting and longer fasts are recommended to reduce or eliminate inflammation, as fasting enhances the body's antioxidant network and overall resilience.

\*Please keep in mind that the above is not a medical advice. You should see your doctor about any possible medical conditions.

## Will fasting help with chronic pain and inflammation??

Fasting has a significant influence on chronic pain management. Regular intermittent fasting or prolonged fasting can help generate ketones, which serve as an alternative fuel source with antioxidant properties that protect neurons and have anti-pain effects. Fasting also releases and recycles serotonin, a mood-related neurotransmitter that can reduce neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, conditions often exacerbated by low serotonin levels.

Additionally, fasting stimulates neurogenesis, the regrowth of nerve cells, which can expedite recovery from nerve damage and alleviate pain. The process releases endorphins, improving mood and decreasing pain. Fasting also affects neurotransmitter receptors and increases BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which supports brain health and repair. In contrast, frequent eating or overeating may lead to increased oxidation in the vascular system, negatively impacting nerve health.

## Will fasting slow down my metabolism?

If you have been starving your body of nutrients, then it is true that your metabolism will slow down. You must be sure you have nutritional reserves and eat nutrient-dense foods Following a diet like Healthy Keto® will help with this. You do not want to fast for a long period of time (longer than 4-5 days), this can cause muscle loss. Start with intermittent fasting then gradually prolong to where you are comfortable.

## Will intermittent fasting help with a lack of good bacteria in the gut?

**This is how to supercharge your gut microbes with intermittent fasting:**

1\. Increase resistance to oxidative stress + xenobiotic stress (exposure to chemicals)

2\. Increase diversity of microbes

3\. Increase tolerance to bad bacteria

4\. Restores intestinal epithelium (lining of the colon)

5\. Microbes live long

6\. Starve off sugar for yeast and candida

## Will nutritional yeast break a fast?

Nutritional yeast will not break a fast as it contains minimal calories and no sugar. It provides amino acids, trace minerals, and B vitamins. In the morning, I often chew three or four nutritional yeast tablets, which, while not the easiest to chew, make me feel good. You can also use the powdered form on salads for a nutty flavor. Nutritional yeast is an excellent source of B vitamins and won't interfere with fasting.
