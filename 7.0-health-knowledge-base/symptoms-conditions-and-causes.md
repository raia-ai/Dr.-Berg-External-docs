# Symptoms, Conditions and Causes

## 7 Early Signs of Liver Damage

**7 Surprising Signs of Liver Damage**

While alcoholic fatty liver disease is a concern, most liver issues stem from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Here are some unexpected signs to watch for:

1. **Bulging or Tightness Under the Right Rib Cage:** This can sometimes lead to right shoulder pain due to pressure on the phrenic nerve.
2. **Loss of Energy:** This differs from typical fatigue. You might experience decreased endurance, especially during exercise, tiredness after eating, or a need for early bedtimes.
3. **Itchiness:** Often worse at night, this itchiness, especially on the feet, is caused by bile salts building up in tissues due to liver problems.
4. **Red Dots or Spider Veins:** High estrogen levels due to liver damage can cause these skin changes. Men might also develop breast tissue, while women might experience symptoms of estrogen dominance.
5. **Thyroid Problems:** Liver issues can impact thyroid function, leading to symptoms like fatigue, hair loss, high cholesterol, and dry skin.
6. **Low Vitamin D:** Liver damage can exacerbate existing vitamin D deficiency. Look out for inflammation, weakened immunity, and muscle problems.
7. **Dark Urine:** Dark, strong-smelling urine can be a sign of liver problems.

**The Root Cause**

Whether it's a fatty liver, inflammation, or cirrhosis, the root cause of many liver problems is often the consumption of sugar, starches, and seed oils.

**The Solution**

Eliminating these culprits from your diet can potentially reverse fatty liver and improve other chronic health issues.

## 8 Ways Your Body Tells You - You Have a Disease

1\. Heart attack/cardiovascular disease Symptoms of heart disease include chest pain, left jaw pain, left shoulder pain, and pain that goes down your left arm. You might also feel dizzy or out of breath when walking upstairs.

Vitamin E in the form of tocotrienols and vitamin K2 can help support the health of your heart and arteries.

2\. Stroke Early warning signs of a stroke involve issues on one side of the body. You might also experience slurred speech. If you think you’re having a stroke, get to the emergency room quickly!

3\. Infections If you have an infection, you may experience a tickle in your throat, a cough that won’t go away, sneezing, or a runny nose.

Take 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 and consume zinc, vitamin C, and echinacea. Don’t suppress your fever!

4\. Fatty liver disease If you have a fatty liver, you’ll have feelings of fullness, tightness, or tenderness under the right rib cage. You might experience referred pain in the right shoulder or right rhomboid.

Intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet may help reverse a fatty liver. It’s also important to avoid alcohol.

5\. Gallstones Warning signs of gallstones include dark urine, stool that floats, light-colored stool, and constipation.

Gallstones are the result of low bile salts, so increasing bile salts may help.

6\. Kidney stones Pain in the abdomen on one side or flank pain can signify kidney stones.

Try drinking 2 ounces of lemon juice with water. Take magnesium glycinate and avoid foods high in oxalates.

7\. Ulcers If you have an ulcer, you might feel burning stomach pain that typically feels better after eating.

Wheatgrass juice powder with water and zinc carnosine may help improve your condition.

8\. Diabetes If you have diabetes, you’ll find it very difficult to skip a meal.

You’ll likely experience carb cravings and need a nap after eating. Keto and intermittent fasting may greatly help improve your symptoms.

## Acetylcholine's Role in Mental Health

### **Acetylcholine's Role in Mental Health**

The brain is like a complex highway, with neurotransmitters acting as traffic signals. Acetylcholine is one such signal, vital for rest and digestion.

#### **Acetylcholine Deficiency and Its Effects**

An acetylcholine deficiency can be likened to faulty traffic lights—things go haywire. It can lead to memory loss, difficulty concentrating, or even depression.

Vitamins B1 and C are essential for keeping acetylcholine levels balanced. A lack of these vitamins could put your mental health at risk.

#### **Diet's Influence on Acetylcholine Levels**

Eating habits play a significant role, too. Picture high-carb diets and sugar as roadblocks that lower the production of this critical neurotransmitter.

Opting for more greens may help boost your body’s ability to produce acetylcholinic acid, clearing the path.

A persistent exhaustion syndrome, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), correlates to depression. The CDC reports that individuals with CFS are four times more likely to experience major depressive disorder than those without the syndrome.

Dysfunctional mitochondria could be at play here. As powerhouses of our cells, when they fail to produce enough energy, it can result in physical exhaustion and potentially trigger depressive symptoms.

Similarly, viral infections might have a role too. Research suggests that certain viruses, such as [Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/epstein-barr-virus-and-its-main-trigger-stress), often seen in CFS patients, may lead to changes in brain function, contributing to depression.

This complex relationship between chronic fatigue and depression calls for an integrated treatment approach that addresses this challenging condition's mental and physical causes.

## Am I potentially consuming an excessive amount of dietary fat?

Let's just talk about dietary fat. If you were to eat fat, let's say you ate so much fat per day, and with that fat you had some carbohydrates, now we're going to just go storage, storage, storage. Because your body's only running on glucose, and you can't tap into that reserve. When you're in keto, now you can actually burn the fat. Now does that mean you can just eat unlimited fat and it's all going to get burned? No.

Here's various factors. Number one, your age, your metabolism, how much insulin resistance you have, which will determine how much fat you'll have actually being burned. So it's kind of, there's just, it's hard to give you more of an answer than that.

That's just the general concept. But if you do this and you notice, wow, not losing weight, even though you're in ketosis, because those ketones could be coming from dietary fat, it really, probably the best way to determine if it's being stored is if you're gaining weight, which is going to be very unlikely. You just might not be losing as much weight.

So there is a point of like too much fat. So does fat get stored like a carbohydrate would get stored because of a carbohydrate? No. What determines whether it gets stored is two things. One is how much of that fat you're using as energy or not, and then also what's going on with your insulin levels. It really depends on if you're doing carbs with that fat, right? That's really the key. If you keep your carbs really, really low, I mean like if you like, if it's zero and you're doing fat, it's very unlikely you're going to be burning that fats.

A good amount of it will be eliminated through the digestive system as well, but it's not(4:51) just going to be converted over there because the pathway of the metabolism of fat is actually (4:59) very different than glucose.

## Are eye exams important?

Prevention is critical when it comes to health, and eye health is no exception. Regular eye exams are crucial for the early detection and management of eye conditions, even if you haven’t noticed any changes in your vision.

Think of these appointments as essential maintenance for your eyes. During an eye exam, an eye care professional can detect early signs of eye diseases that you might not be aware of, allowing for timely intervention and treatment.

Early detection is essential in preventing visual acuity loss and maintaining good eye health.

***

## Are ice baths beneficial for your health?

Ice baths can be highly therapeutic, although they can feel quite uncomfortable, especially during the winter months. If you're able to endure the cold, consider supplementing with vitamin B1 (thiamine) to enhance your tolerance to temperature extremes, as a deficiency in B1 can diminish your overall stress resilience.

Engaging in ice baths may significantly reduce inflammation and improve cognitive function. Whether you choose to immerse yourself in a cold pond during winter, take a cold bath, or opt for a cold shower, you can experience the therapeutic benefits of cold exposure.

## Are insects a viable source of protein?

The idea of eating insects by 2050 due to population growth and sustainability concerns is debated. While insects are rich in protein, fat, and carbs, the quantity needed to meet dietary needs could be costly and less nutritious if feeding practices are compromised.

Comparatively, insects fall short of beef in protein and nutritional value. They also carry potential pathogens; studies show high rates of parasites and pathogenic bacteria among edible cricket farms. Additionally, those allergic to shellfish may react to insects due to similar proteins. Chitin in insect exoskeletons acts as an antinutrient, blocking absorption of vitamins A and E.

## Are there any diagnostic tests for adrenal fatigue?

### **Diagnostic Tests for Adrenal Dysfunction**

When it comes to adrenal dysfunction, early detection is crucial. Let's explore a few ways to identify this disorder.

#### **Raglan's Test**

The Raglan's test gauges blood pressure variations when transitioning from lying down to standing up. In healthy individuals, the systolic (upper) number usually rises slightly.

If your [systolic pressure](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-is-my-systolic-blood-pressure-high) does not increase or decrease, it could indicate adrenal fatigue. This quick and easy home test provides valuable insights, but remember - it shouldn’t replace professional medical advice.

#### **CO2 Tolerance Test**

This one measures how long you can exhale after a deep breath – like blowing out birthday candles, except these won't get you any gifts. Check out more on CO2 tolerance testing here.

A shorter exhalation time could indicate low carbon dioxide levels in your body - another possible sign of adrenal dysfunction. But don't worry. If the results seem off, there are ways to fix this.

## Are there specific beverages known to alleviate symptoms of depression?

Green tea, known for its unfermented leaves, contains active compounds beneficial for health, including reducing depression. Studies show drinking green tea can lower depression rates significantly, with L-theanine contributing to mood stabilization. Green tea affects brain regions like the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus, improving cognitive function and memory. It also offers anti-carcinogenic, antimicrobial, and neuroprotective properties.

Other natural methods to combat depression include:

* **Exercise:** Similar to Zoloft, exercise reduces depression symptoms. High-intensity interval training is particularly effective.
* **Vitamin D:** Deficiency increases depression risk; sunlight exposure and supplements are crucial.
* **Fasting:** Can enhance bodily functions and reduce depression symptoms due to its survival properties.

These approaches can complement each other in managing and alleviating symptoms of depression naturally.

***

## Are you a liver type if you’ve had your gallbladder removed?

Having your gallbladder removed doesn't categorically label you as a "liver type," but it does indicate potential issues related to bile production and management. Gallbladder removal often occurs due to conditions like gallstones or infections, which can also reflect underlying liver health concerns, as the liver produces bile salts. While it doesn't definitively mean you are a "liver type," it suggests a need to monitor liver health and bile production, as both are interconnected in the digestive process.

***

## Are you experiencing symptoms of copper deficiency?

Zinc can be beneficial for many different health problems. But, if you take too much zinc (over 40mg) over a period of weeks, this could create a copper deficiency.

Zinc and copper work together. So, it’s always good to take copper when you’re taking zinc to avoid a copper deficiency. You could also take all of the trace minerals together with zinc.

Symptoms of a copper deficiency:

1\. Nausea

2\. Flu-like symptoms (this is due to neutropenia, which is lowered white blood cells)

3\. Anemia (fatigue and weakness)

4\. Stomach pain

5\. Tingling and numbness in the hands or feet

6\. Diarrhea

7\. Loss of skin tone

8\. Vomiting

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/too-much-zinc-causes-a-copper-deficiency)

***

## Are you taking too much zinc?

The recommended daily zinc intake is 11 mg for adult males and 9 mg for adult females. While individuals with deficiencies or infections may benefit from higher doses, adults should not exceed 40 mg daily to avoid toxicity. Factors like low stomach acid, stress, and high sugar intake can contribute to zinc deficiency. Dr. Berg suggests that doses above 40 mg may be beneficial in certain cases. If taking high doses of zinc, it's crucial to supplement with copper at a 10:1 zinc-to-copper ratio. Always consult with a healthcare professional before taking zinc supplements, especially if you have existing health conditions or are on medication.

Zinc Toxicity: Are You Taking Too Much?

[https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-much-zinc-is-too-toxic](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-much-zinc-is-too-toxic)

***

## Are zinc poisoning and zinc toxicity the same thing?

Zinc poisoning typically results from a single large dose of zinc, leading to acute symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps.

Zinc toxicity is characterized by the development of health issues caused by chronic zinc exposure linked to symptoms such as anemia, copper deficiency, and neurological problems.

***

## At what blood sugar levels does the risk of damage to bodily systems increase?

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends an A1C below 7.4, equivalent to a blood sugar level of 166, which is too high. Damage from high blood sugar begins above 100. A study shows that fasting blood glucose between 110 and 125 can destroy 40% of pancreatic beta cells, leading to less insulin and more damage. The ideal A1C is under 5%. To improve your levels, consider reducing refined carbs and sugar, and try intermittent fasting, which may help reverse damage if addressed early.

## B12 Deficiency Symptoms That You Should NEVER Ignore

While it's true that vegans and vegetarians are at a higher risk, vitamin B12 deficiency can affect anyone. This crucial nutrient plays a role in DNA production and repair, and a deficiency can elevate your cancer risk. It also supports nerve health, and a shortage can lead to anemia.

Early signs of deficiency include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, and tingling in the extremities.

As the deficiency progresses, you might experience:

• Tongue changes (red, swollen, shiny)

• Mouth ulcers

• Shortness of breath

• Dizziness upon standing

• Cognitive issues

• Anxiety and depression

• Sleep disruptions

• Vitiligo (skin patches)

Severe deficiency can result in walking difficulties, muscle weakness, and serious psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations. It can even lead to permanent nerve damage.

If you don't eat animal products regularly, you're at risk. Incorporate foods like clams, liver, sardines, red meat, tuna, salmon, grass-fed dairy, and eggs into your diet.

Low stomach acid or a genetic issue called polymorphism can also hinder B12 absorption.

If you supplement, choose methylcobalamin, the natural form. Remember, a healthy liver, small intestine, and acidic stomach are essential for proper B12 absorption and function.

## Bloating - The Ultimate Indicator of the Right Diet

Have you ever felt like a balloon ready to pop after a big meal or constantly battling the urge to unbutton your jeans? You're not alone. Digestive woes affect a whopping 70% of us, but the good news is that gut health is the key to easing much of this discomfort.

Think of your gut health journey as a puzzle where everything from diet to exercise plays a role. Even seemingly innocent habits like drinking through a straw or consuming dairy can trigger bloating.

Let's explore why certain foods make us feel like we've swallowed a balloon and uncover dietary changes that offer relief. Say goodbye to nights spent on the couch fighting discomfort and hello to a more comfortable you.

The small intestine is your body's unsung hero, breaking down food and absorbing nutrients. Its vast surface area, covered in villi and microvilli, ensures you get the most out of every bite. This intricate design is essential for transforming proteins, fats, and carbs into usable energy.

Your gut bacteria are also crucial players, assisting in breaking down food that your enzymes alone can't handle. A healthy gut microbiome, fueled by fiber-rich foods, is a powerhouse for overall well-being.

But what affects your small intestine's health? Processed foods, seed oils, synthetic starches, and sugars are like unwanted guests, causing inflammation and damage. These troublemakers can disrupt your gut's delicate balance.

Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) is another culprit. It's like an overcrowded party where microbes end up in places they shouldn't be, leading to excessive bloating and fermentation. If you're constantly battling bloat, SIBO might be to blame.

Your diet is your gut's best friend. Fiber, found in abundance in salads, is essential for healthy digestion and stool quality. Gradually increasing fiber intake can transform sluggishness into lightness and energy.

Variety is also key to gut health. By diversifying your plant intake, you introduce new microbes that enrich your gut's ecosystem. Even occasional fasting can give your digestive system a break, promoting microbial diversity and reducing inflammation.

Digestive health isn't just about avoiding discomfort; it's about overall well-being. Your nervous system and colon are interconnected, so nourishing meals are essential for maintaining balance. Magnesium-rich leafy greens are natural peacekeepers, preventing colon spasms.

Nutrients like magnesium, B vitamins, and zinc are vital for nerve function and repair, supporting a happy gut and a happier you. Simple dietary tweaks, like adding spinach to your smoothie or choosing whole grains, can significantly impact your digestive health.

Your body often sends signals about its needs through bloating, constipation, or floating stool. These signs can indicate potential issues with your gallbladder, pancreas, or overall digestion. Bloating might be a whisper from dairy products or a shout from carbonated drinks. Stool quality, whether floating or hard, hints at possible malabsorption or fiber deficiency.

These signs are your body's way of communicating. Listen to them and adjust your diet accordingly. By avoiding trigger foods and making necessary changes, you can say goodbye to stomach pain and hello to improved gut health.

Boosting stomach acid is another key to better digestion. Betaine hyaluronic chloride can help increase stomach acid levels, leading to easier digestion, better nutrient absorption, and a stronger defense against harmful bacteria. However, consult a healthcare professional before making significant changes.

Remember, gut health is a journey, not a destination. It's about finding balance and listening to your body. By making informed choices, incorporating fiber-rich foods, embracing variety, and supporting your stomach acid, you can pave the way to a happier, healthier gut and a more vibrant you.

## Boosting Your Immune System Naturally: Vitamin D vs. Prednisone

**Boosting Your Immune System Naturally: Vitamin D vs. Prednisone**

Your immune system is a complex network with two main components:

* **Innate Immunity:** Your body's first line of defense, present from birth.
* **Acquired Immunity:** Develops over time as you encounter various infections.

Autoimmune diseases arise from problems with the "peacekeepers" of your immune system, called T-regulatory cells or T-cells. These cells are crucial for turning off the immune response once a threat is neutralized.

While prednisone, a synthetic cortisol, is often used to treat autoimmune diseases, it suppresses both parts of your immune system. **Vitamin D offers a different approach:**

* **Empowers Immunity:** Unlike prednisone, vitamin D enhances your immune system, particularly increasing T-cell production.
* **Reduces Inflammation:** Vitamin D suppresses inflammatory cells (TH1 and TH17), which are often overactive in autoimmune conditions.
* **Blood Sugar Control:** Prednisone can raise blood sugar levels, while vitamin D actually helps regulate them and supports insulin production.
* **Bone Health:** Prednisone can weaken bones, but vitamin D promotes calcium absorption and bone health.
* **Thymus Support:** The thymus gland, responsible for T-cell production, declines with age. Vitamin D helps slow this decline, but requires therapeutic doses and essential cofactors like magnesium, vitamin K2, and zinc.

**The Coimbra Protocol:**

Dr. Coimbra in Brazil developed a protocol using high doses of vitamin D to overcome resistance and significantly increase its levels in the body. This, in turn, lowers parathyroid hormone and helps manage autoimmune conditions.

**Key Takeaway:**

Vitamin D offers a natural way to support and modulate your immune system, unlike prednisone which suppresses it. Consult with a healthcare professional to determine if vitamin D therapy is right for you.

## Can a deficiency in potassium contribute to the development of heart failure?

**A potassium deficiency is also known as hypokalemia. Potassium is involved in muscle physiology, nerve physiology, and cardiovascular physiology. You can develop atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure, or a high pulse rate with low potassium levels. Low potassium can also lead to insulin resistance and cravings for carbs.**

The symptoms of potassium deficiency include:

• Tiredness

• Leg cramps

• Weakness

• Constipation

• Tremors

A recent article highlights the fact that maintaining normal potassium levels is vital to supporting a healthy heart. Potassium can help reduce your risk of artery disease, stroke, and heart attack. It can also help support your artery elasticity.

**The best sources of potassium are:**

• Beet tops

• Vegetables

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/the-root-cause-of-cardiac-arrhythmias-ismust-watch)

• Figs

***

## Can a deficiency in potassium influence blood sugar levels, and what mechanisms might explain the relationship between these two factors?

Yes, having a potassium deficiency can cause blood sugar issues. When you consume more carbohydrates, you become insulin resistant, which leads to higher blood sugar levels. Potassium is involved in storing glucose as glycogen. Increasing potassium intake can aid with proper glucose storage. This is why potassium is a key ingredient of Blood Sugar Support Advanced Formula.

***

## Can a deficiency in vitamin B contribute to the development or exacerbation of anxiety, and what specific B vitamins are most closely linked to mental health?

**Low B vitamins**

B vitamins are crucial for calmness, relaxation, and healthy sleep. Low B vitamins can reduce your ability to handle physical and mental stress, which can result in anxiety symptoms. B vitamin deficiency mainly stems from not consuming them in your diet or consuming things that deplete you of them.

***

## Can a ketogenic diet provide benefits for individuals with Alzheimer's disease?

**Alzheimer’s and ketosis:**

As well as the rest of the human body, our brain runs on fuel. Alzheimer’s disease (whether caused by genetics or brain damage) makes the brain unable to efficiently utilize sugar/carb fuel (glucose), resulting in brain starvation. However, our brains love ketones (fat-burning fuel) more than sugar/carb fuel anyway. Although the damaged brain parts of Alzheimer’s disease patients can’t utilize glucose efficiently, they can successfully utilize ketones.

***

## Can adopting a plant-based diet contribute to the reduction of fibroids?

Following a keto diet can be more challenging on a plant-based regimen due to the need for adequate protein and essential nutrients like B12, bioavailable forms of zinc and iron, and retinol (the active form of vitamin A). While it is possible to achieve a vegan keto diet, careful planning is essential to ensure you're obtaining these vital nutrients. I recommend watching my videos on how to effectively implement a vegan-style keto approach, as you may need to incorporate additional nutritional sources to meet your dietary needs.

***

## Can adrenal fatigue lead to weight gain?

Adrenal fatigue, particularly chronic stress, can lead to weight gain, exacerbated by poor dietary habits. Cortisol, released during stress, increases energy (sugar) storage as fat when unused, and can degrade muscle mass by converting it into sugar. Additionally, cortisol inhibits fat burning, making ketosis difficult.

Addressing stress sources is crucial. Implementing Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting can help, along with ensuring adequate intake of vitamin D, vitamin C, and potassium.

***

## Can blood-thinning medications lead to an increased tendency to bruise, and what mechanisms underlie this effect?

Blood-thinning medications can cause excessive bruising because they prevent clots from stopping blood loss. If you are on blood thinners or calcium channel blockers (for example, in some blood pressure medications) they can cause easy bruising. If you suspect this is the reason, consult with your doctor.

***

## Can carbohydrate consumption contribute to the experience of brain fog?

Brain Fog Overview

**Symptoms**:

\- Lapse of awareness

\- Forgetfulness

\- Inability to focus

\- Easily distracted

**Causes**:

\- **Excess Refined Carbs and Sugar**: Leads to brain fuel deprivation.

***

## Can castor oil worsen hot flashes?

Castor oil is renowned for its multifaceted benefits such as skincare and anti-inflammatory properties; however, it is not typically recommended for alleviating hot flashes. While it serves as a laxative and antioxidant, alternative approaches such as iodine or DIM (diindolylmethane) could be explored for managing hot flashes more effectively. For personalized guidance on suitable alternatives or supplements, consulting with a healthcare provider is advisable, as individual responses to treatments can vary significantly.

***

## Can chronic stress contribute to the development of clogged arteries?

As you know already, high amounts of inflammation can damage your arterial tissue and your body will try to heal the damage with plaques. Chronic stress can eventually lead to inflammation because one of the stress-regulating hormones is cortisol, which has anti-inflammatory properties. If your stress-regulating glands (adrenals) are worn out, producing too much cortisol over time, this can eventually result in inflammation, damage and arterial clogging.

***

## Can coffee consumption lead to inflammation in the body?

Coffee can have both benefits and potential drawbacks regarding inflammation. While some individuals may experience worsened inflammation, especially those with gut sensitivities or intolerances to herbs and plants, coffee is generally known to have anti-inflammatory properties for many people. It's essential to observe personal tolerance and consider reducing or avoiding coffee if it exacerbates inflammation or digestive issues. Consulting a healthcare provider can offer tailored advice based on individual health concerns.

***

## Can crossing your legs contribute to low back pain?

Crossing legs excessively can contribute to low back pain due to the imbalance it creates in the muscles supporting the pelvis. When one side's hip-raising muscles shorten from prolonged crossing, it can misalign the vertebrae and compress nerves, leading to discomfort.

To assess and alleviate this issue:

\- Alternate crossing legs to avoid overuse on one side.

\- Check for tightness in the crossed leg's hip-raising muscle.

\- Stretch the tight side gently to restore balance.

\- Use a self-test involving standing with one leg on a book to gauge discomfort and flexibility differences between sides.

\- Perform exercises to strengthen and stretch the affected muscles, such as lifting and lowering the opposite leg while keeping the knee locked.

Consistent practice of these exercises can relieve existing pain and prevent future issues by promoting muscle balance and pelvic alignment.

## Can damage to brain cells lead to the phenomenon of brain fog, and what specific mechanisms or conditions might facilitate this cognitive impairment?

Bruises—also known as contusions—happen when the capillaries under your skin have bled internally due to their weakness or due to impact. Bruising is very common, and not typically something to worry about. However, if you bruise very easily, this can be a sign of an underlying issue.

**Cause #1: Nutrient deficiencies**

Vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients are important for the healthy structure of blood vessels and the thickness of your blood. If you have a nutrient deficiency, this can weaken your capillaries or thin your blood, leading to excessive bleeding.

* **Calcium is vital for the healthy structure of your veins and capillaries. If you lack calcium, this can result in bruising easily.**
* **Vitamin D deficiency can cause an inability to absorb calcium, resulting in the above condition.**
* **Lack of vitamin K1. This vitamin helps your blood clot. If you have malabsorption or lack of bile (gallbladder not functioning properly or removed) this will create inability to absorb vitamins K1 and D).**
* **Lack of vitamin C. This has everything to do with keeping your capillaries strong. Without it, you lose collagen that surrounds your capillaries.**
* **Low vitamin B12 and low folate can cause insufficient amounts of thrombocytes (cells that help you with blood clotting.)**

***

## Can damage to brain cells lead to the phenomenon of brain fog?

**Damage of brain cells**

Another cause of brain fog is damage of the brain cells, for example due to aging or injury. Additionally, lack of sleep can cause hormonal imbalance and this can result in a bad effect on your brain. Prolonged fasting will help not only with providing ketones to feed your brain, but also by activating autophagy (healing/detoxifying process in the body).

***

## Can eating salad contribute to weight gain?

Hidden carbs from croutons, dried fruit, or salad dressings can cause weight gain, but if you're following keto and intermittent fasting, they are likely not the issue.

Increased salad intake may lead to digestive issues if your body lacks the necessary microbes and enzymes. Vegetables contain two types of fiber: soluble (retains water) and insoluble (does not). Inadequate fiber breakdown can slow digestion and cause water retention, leading to weight gain.

To prevent this, try:

1\. Steaming vegetables to break down fiber.

2\. Choosing easier-to-digest vegetables like squash, cauliflower, broccoli, and asparagus.

3\. Gradually increasing vegetable intake to build up gut microflora.

This approach helps reduce bloating and water retention while your body adjusts to digesting fiber efficiently.

***

## Can eczema be linked to salicylate sensitivity?

One common cause of eczema: Salicylate sensitivity. This is a natural acid present in plants, spices, and nuts. It's a protective mechanism for plants. I would recommend just avoiding all these triggers for 1 week and see if your skin improves to know for sure if you have this problem.

## Can elevated estrogen levels contribute to the development of acne?

Estrogen is a vital hormone that has many different functions in the body. However, if your body has excess estrogen it can be the reason for acne, especially if intermittent fasting and the Healthy Keto® diet have not resolved your skin problems.

***

## Can elevated insulin levels contribute to the development of clogged arteries?

Clogged arteries are created due to certain plaques in the blood routes. This can create a lot of difficulty and stress on your body because it lowers the ability of blood to freely move through its channels.

**Myth about cholesterol**

When it comes to clogged arteries, most people focus on cholesterol. They want to lower their cholesterol by eliminating things like fat, butter, eggs and animal meat. I want to go over some additional data that has to do with the chain reaction that occurs before cholesterol enters your arteries.

Not all cholesterol is bad. In fact, your body makes a ton of it--more than 3,000 mg a day. Keep in mind that an egg only contains 300 mg of cholesterol. If your body makes so much, why is it considered bad? It’s not. Every cell wall is made from cholesterol. Hormones, specifically sex hormones, are made from cholesterol.

When your artery gets damaged, cholesterol comes as a band-aid for the damage, creating a plaque along with calcium and fibrin (connective tissue). However, we need to fix the underlying issue, which is this: what is creating the damage to your arteries in the first place? Knowing the cause of the damage, you can resolve the plaques and avoid the clogged-artery condition.

**Cause #1: High amounts of insulin**

Frequent eating and a high-carb diet will cause your insulin to be very high. Insulin is a hormone that has the capacity to cause clogged arteries. This is because insulin creates inflammation in the body, which eventually will result in damaged tissue. If this damage occurs in the arteries, your body will try to heal it using a combination of cholesterol, calcium and fibrin (connective tissue) that creates a plaque.

## Can excessive calcium intake lead to kidney stones?

Studies show that taking around 500mg of calcium carbonate will increase your risk of developing kidney stones. Massive doses of vitamin D over many months can also cause hypercalcemia, which can contribute to kidney stones. However, neither of these are the primary causes of kidney stones.

**The most common reasons for kidney stones are:**

1\. Kidney damage - years of bad dieting can cause poor kidney function. Try a healthy keto diet.

2\. Excess oxalates - avoid oxalate-rich foods, including almonds, spinach, swiss chard, and chocolate.

3\. Low citrates - take citrates or lemon juice.

4\. Low fluid - stay hydrated! At least 2.5 liters each day.

5\. Poor microbiome - improve your microbiome with probiotics and prebiotics (fiber).

6\. Low bile - take purified bile salts if you have low bile or a missing gallbladder.

## Can fenugreek help with hair loss when taking creatine?

Fenugreek may help mitigate hair loss associated with creatine use due to its potential to influence DHT levels, a potent form of testosterone linked to hair follicle health. Essential co-factors like zinc, copper, and selenium are crucial for activating proteins necessary for hair growth. Additionally, ensuring adequate intake of trace minerals and B vitamins is essential for supporting overall hair health.

***

## Can fluctuations in blood sugar levels contribute to the occurrence of headaches and migraines?

Low blood sugar can trigger headaches and migraines. When you eat carbs, your blood sugar goes up, and your ache may disappear. However this will not resolve the issue because shortly after, your blood sugar will go low again, causing a new headache.

I recommend getting on the Healthy Keto® diet, which will give your body a better type of fuel for your brain: ketones (a byproduct of fat-burning). Ketones will not cause your blood sugar to go up and down. Stable blood sugar may resolve the headache issue.

(Note: If you have just started a keto diet, headaches could be a symptom of adapting to the diet.)

## Can fruit extracts raise blood sugar levels?

Impact of Fruit Extracts on Blood Sugar [https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-only-sugar-that-wont-raise-your-blood-sugar](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-only-sugar-that-wont-raise-your-blood-sugar)

**Fructose Content**

Many fruit extracts contain fructose, a natural sugar. While fructose does not directly spike blood sugar levels like glucose, it is processed by the liver. Over time, excessive fructose consumption can lead to insulin resistance, which indirectly raises blood sugar levels.

**Glucose Content**

Some fruit extracts may also contain glucose, which directly increases blood sugar levels and triggers insulin release.

**Concentrated Sugars**

Fruit extracts are often concentrated, meaning they may contain higher levels of natural sugars compared to whole fruits. This concentration can lead to a more significant impact on blood sugar levels.

**Considerations for Managing Blood Sugar**

If you have conditions like Type 2 Diabetes or are managing blood sugar levels, it's essential to monitor the type and amount of fruit extracts consumed.

Opt for extracts with low or no added sugars and minimal fructose content.

Always check the nutritional label for sugar content and consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice.

***

## Can gallbladder problems cause fat malabsorption?

Yes, gallbladder problems can lead to fat malabsorption. Issues such as gallstones or gallbladder inflammation can hinder bile release, resulting in poor digestion of fats and inadequate absorption of fat-soluble nutrients, leading to digestive issues such as diarrhea, pale stools, and bloating.

***

## Can gut microbial imbalances lead to a reduced tolerance to allergens?

A microbial imbalance can cause decreased tolerance to allergens. This imbalance occurs when you have an overgrowth of bad bacteria and not enough good bacteria. You can help restore your microbial balance by supporting the good bacteria in your gut and by acidifying the stomach to reduce the overgrowth of bad bacteria.

## Can hypothyroidism develop into Hashimoto's thyroiditis?

While hypothyroidism doesn't always lead to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, it's important to note that in about 90% of cases, hypothyroidism is indeed linked to this autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid. Therefore, addressing the underlying autoimmune issue is essential.

In this context, I recommend focusing on selenium intake, as it is generally more beneficial than iodine, although a moderate amount of iodine can still be helpful. I've created a detailed video on this topic for further guidance.

Additionally, many cases of thyroid dysfunction can originate in the gut, highlighting the significant connection between gluten, grains, and autoimmune responses. It is crucial to avoid these foods to help manage symptoms effectively.

***

## Can I consume fats even if my gallbladder is removed?

The liver continues producing bile even without a gallbladder. Although there's no longer concentrated storage of bile, it flows directly from the liver into the small intestine at a steady rate allowing for ongoing digestion of dietary fats.

***

## Can I diagnose magnesium deficiency with a blood test?

Magnesium deficiency is notoriously difficult to diagnose accurately. Only about 1% of the body's magnesium is present in the blood, while the majority is stored within cells, bones, and muscles.

Therefore, standard blood tests, which measure serum magnesium levels, often fail to reflect an individual's true magnesium status. Even if blood levels appear normal, a person may still be deficient at the cellular level.

This difficulty in assessment leads to a significant underdiagnosis of magnesium deficiency, even though it is believed to be quite prevalent.

***

## Can I have apple cider vinegar if I have an ulcer?

If you have an ulcer, you’ll find that apple cider vinegar exacerbates your ulcer symptoms. It’s best to wait until your ulcer heals to consume apple cider vinegar.

***

## Can I take magnesium and berberine if I’m on a statin?

Yes, you can take magnesium and berberine while on a statin. However, it's crucial to supplement with Coenzyme Q10 in its reduced form, known as ubiquinol. Ubiquinol supports mitochondrial function and helps mitigate potential muscle issues associated with statin use, as it follows similar biochemical pathways affected by statins' inhibition of cholesterol production.

***

## Can I take testosterone?

Your body has a complex hormone feedback system that the brain uses to communicate to turn on or off testosterone production. When you change your natural hormone levels with external sources, there can be many side effects that may reduce your quality of life.

The effects of taking testosterone may include:

•Worsening sleep apnea

•Moodiness

•Acne

•Dizziness

•Higher risk of heart disease

•Decreased fertility

•Thickening of blood

•Testicular atrophy

•Erectile dysfunction

***

## Can insufficient nutrition cause hunger levels increasing?

### **Nutrient Intake and Hunger Signals**

Explains how insufficient nutrient intake, particularly from vegetables, can lead to feelings of hunger even on a low-carb diet.

![vinaigrette dressing](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/woman-adding-tasty-apple-vinegar-to-salad-with-vegetables-on-table.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **The Crucial Role of Vegetables**

Shedding light on how veggies, crucial for their nutrient-rich profiles and ability to fill you up, play an indispensable role in a low-carb diet.

Vegetables aren't just the colorful side characters on your plate; they're nutrient-dense superheroes fighting off hunger. When you skimp on these, especially in a low-carb diet, you might find yourself constantly raiding the fridge.

Veggies are packed with fiber and essential nutrients that help keep us whole.

This isn't just about filling up your stomach; it's about giving your body what it needs to function optimally. A lack of sufficient nutrient intake can leave you hungry no matter how much you eat. So next time, maybe let kale join the party, too.

#### **Addressing Nutrient Absorption Issues**

How insulin resistance and gallbladder or liver issues can affect nutrient absorption and satisfaction.

If eating more vegetables still leaves you wanting snacks, consider this: Maybe it's not what you eat but how your body handles it. Insulin resistance and gallbladder or liver issues can throw a wrench into nutrient absorption processes.

Facing such challenges doesn’t mean defeat; understanding them is step one toward adjusting your approach for better health outcomes.

Chatting with a health expert about these hurdles might be the secret sauce to mastering your appetite and maintaining a low-carb way of life.

## Can liver dysfunction be linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease?

There is some interesting data that suggest that Alzheimer’s may originate in the liver. The liver helps clear out certain plaques so they don’t spread to other parts of the body. But when the liver is compromised, it can have a hard time getting rid of the plaquing, which can then develop in the brain. Additionally, some of the symptoms of fatty liver disease and cirrhosis are similar to Alzheimer’s disease.

## Can magnesium deficiency cause acid reflux?

Magnesium plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, even extending to the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach and the proper functioning of the valves that prevent acid reflux.

Here are the key takeaways:

* **Magnesium's Widespread Impact:** Magnesium isn't just about energy production; it's essential for countless "mechanical gears and pumps" within our cells.
* **Stomach Acid Production:** Magnesium is necessary for producing hydrochloric acid, which is critical for digestion.
* **Valve Control:** Magnesium also helps control the valves at the top and bottom of the stomach, preventing acid reflux (GERD).
* **Magnesium Deficiency Consequences:** Without enough magnesium, individuals might experience low stomach acid.

Magnesium deficiency can lead to a cascade of problems and impact digestion. This further underlines the importance of maintaining adequate magnesium levels for overall health. If you are experiencing acid reflux or GERD, it is important to consult your healthcare professional for guidance.

***

## Can maltodextrin in deodorants be absorbed into the body?

Maltodextrin in deodorants is unlikely to absorb into your body and affect blood sugar levels directly. However, maltodextrin can significantly impact blood sugar responses and is commonly found in many daily products, including supplements and flavorings. It's advisable to be mindful of its presence in your diet and products you use.

***

## Can stress cause a stomach ulcer?

Stress is one of the leading causes of stomach ulcers. When the body is in a stressed “fight or flight” state, digestion is inhibited.

***

## Can stress cause heartburn?

Yes, stress can indeed cause heartburn. Stress diverts blood flow away from the digestive system, including the stomach, leading to lower hydrochloric acid (HCl) production. Decreased HCl impairs the signal to close the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), allowing acid to reflux into the esophagus, causing heartburn and indigestion. Stress management techniques are associated with better digestive health. Managing stress can help prevent the body from decreasing stomach acid production, which is crucial for proper digestion. In addition, stress is cited as a leading cause of stomach ulcers, which can exacerbate heartburn.

***

## Can sucralose raise your blood sugar?

Sucralose is a zero-carb sweetener and won’t directly raise blood sugar levels. However, there is evidence that sucralose may stimulate certain taste receptors that trigger metabolic changes linked to increased blood sugar and insulin levels.

***

## Can the brain function effectively without carbohydrates?

Dr. Berg talks about the fuel source of the brain. Your brain can run on alternative fuel sources and you do not have to consume carbs or glucose to get energy. It can run on ketones, which is the byproduct of fat. If it needs glucose, it can make it from protein (dietary) and fat.

***

## Can the consumption of yeast contribute to the development of yeast infections or candida infections in individuals?

The answer is no. There are good forms of yeast and bad forms of yeast. To destroy the bad yeast, you need to consume more good yeast. Kefir is the best source of yeast for helping with yeast infections. You can find kefir the health foods store. Make sure you get organic, whole-milk kefir without added flavors.

Microbes are not all bad—they are essential to the body’s natural functioning. This includes yeast.

## Can vitamin deficiencies contribute to low back pain

Lower back pain, especially chronic pain, is often treated with medications, but understanding the root causes can lead to long-term relief. Nutritional deficiencies play a significant role in back pain:

1\. **Vitamin D**: Deficiency can cause bone pain, inflammation, soft bones, and skeletal problems in children. Magnesium and boron deficiencies can also affect vitamin D levels, leading to back issues.

2\. **Vitamin K2**: Deficiency can result in stenosis, arthritis, bone spurs, and calcium deposits. Vitamin K2 works synergistically with vitamin D.

3\. **Vitamin E**: Deficiency can cause back weakness and atrophy. Prefer tocotrienol complexes or wheat germ oil over tocopherols.

4\. **Manganese**: Deficiency can lead to disc problems, collagen issues, and an increased risk of scoliosis.

Other contributors to back pain include an imbalance of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, a high sugar and carbohydrate diet, kidney stones, and gallstones. Addressing these nutritional deficiencies and dietary factors can help alleviate chronic back pain.

***

## Can you reverse alcoholic liver disease?

To improve liver health after drinking, it’s crucial to support liver cell function with a nutritious liver cleanse diet rich in green leafy vegetables, broccoli sprouts, and turmeric. In addition, certain supplements, including milk thistle, CoQ10, and astaxanthin, have been found to mitigate the adverse effects of alcohol and promote liver cell regeneration.

***

## Correlation Between Magnesium Deficiency and Muscle Stiffness

There is a correlation between magnesium deficiency and muscle stiffness or cramps in the morning.

Here's why:

* **Muscle Relaxation:** Magnesium is crucial for muscle relaxation. It acts as a natural calcium channel blocker, preventing excessive calcium influx into muscle cells, which can lead to contraction and stiffness.
* **Electrolyte Balance:** Magnesium plays a vital role in maintaining electrolyte balance, which is crucial for proper muscle function. Imbalances may lead to muscle cramps and spasms, often more pronounced in the morning due to the natural dip in magnesium levels.
* **Energy Production:** Magnesium is also involved in energy production within muscle cells. A deficiency can lead to fatigue and weakness, making muscles feel stiff and sluggish.
* **Circadian Rhythm:** Magnesium levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day, being lowest in the morning. This can contribute to increased muscle tension and stiffness upon waking.

If you have a magnesium deficiency or any symptoms associated with magnesium deficiency, please don't hesitate to contact your healthcare provider for guidance.

***

## Could a deficiency in vitamin B12 be contributing to my respiratory difficulties during physical activities?

Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in the production of red blood cells, and a deficiency can lead to conditions such as pernicious anemia. Anemia may also stem from deficiencies in folic acid or iron, which can contribute to feelings of fatigue or a lack of energy. It's important to note that B12 is primarily obtained from animal products. However, even if you consume these foods, inadequate hydrochloric acid levels can hinder your ability to extract this essential vitamin from meat proteins. Consequently, various factors can impede B12 absorption, and a deficiency can certainly leave you feeling winded, particularly during physical exertion, such as climbing inclines.

***

## Could a racing mind indicate a vitamin deficiency?

If your adrenal glands are being overworked, that can cause excessive thinking, which means your mind is working to solve problems 24/7. This can be very draining and usually affects your sleep. Social media, cell phones, and texting can all keep your adrenals working, leading to overthinking. Try techniques to reduce stress and overstimulation from electronics, as well as taking vitamins that support your adrenals.

## Could excessive intake of vitamin K2 contribute to the formation of bone spurs?

No, excessive intake of vitamin K2 does not cause bone spurs. The body naturally regulates the absorption and utilization of vitamin K2, preventing any risk of overaccumulation that could lead to bone spurs.

***

## Could hormonal imbalances contribute to the onset or progression of Alzheimer's disease?

As you age, your hormone levels change. One of the hormones that is increased by aging is luteinizing hormone (LH). LH has to do with male and female reproductive systems and it increases hormones like estrogen and testosterone. Based on recent studies, there is a connection between Alzheimer’s and high levels of luteinizing hormone (LH). Melatonin was found as a good remedy to lower the LH.

***

## Could the consumption of apple cider vinegar lead to diarrhea?

Apple cider vinegar may induce diarrhea due to its acetic acid content and its effect on gut microbiota, potentially signaling an imbalance in the gut microbiome. If you experience diarrhea after consumption, it is advisable to reduce your intake or discontinue use. While apple cider vinegar has been associated with various health benefits, it may not be suitable for everyone. For ongoing gastrointestinal issues, a comprehensive evaluation, such as a stool analysis, can help identify any significant microbial imbalances. Additionally, considering a lower dosage or exploring the use of apple cider vinegar in pill form may help alleviate symptoms.

***

## Could the consumption of nutritional yeast contribute to the development of constipation?

I would recommend exploring other factors, as nutritional yeast is unlikely to cause constipation due to its minimal caloric content. It's worth examining other dietary changes you may have made. For some individuals, excessive salad or greens can lead to digestive issues, while for others, insufficient greens may be the problem. Consider reviewing any recent additions to your diet that could be contributing to the issue.

***

## Could the consumption of phytoestrogens potentially exacerbate the symptoms associated with estrogen dominance?

Nope! What happens is the plant estrogens compete for the stronger estrogens that are creating a problem, and so they're more protective. They help balance the estrogen ratios because you have three different estrogens and it puts you in a better place, estrogen-wise, in a more protective against cancer place, and so no it's not going to make things worse at all. And this is why if someone does have estrogen dominance, we recommend things like cruciferous vegetables, because a lot of the properties are they have phytoestrogens, and this is also why I would recommend flaxseed oil, and it just so happens that these phytoestrogens are basically anti-carcinogenic.

***

## Did you know that a high-sugar diet can deplete your body's vitamin B1?

**Did you know that a high-sugar diet can deplete your body's vitamin B1?** This essential vitamin, also known as thiamine, is crucial for nerve health and energy production.

**Why is this a problem?**

A vitamin B1 deficiency can lead to:

* **Restless legs syndrome:** This is because a lack of B1 can cause fluid retention and lactic acid buildup.
* **Complications related to diabetes:** Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are linked to B1 deficiency.

**Could you be low in vitamin B1?**

Watch out for these warning signs:

* **Nervous system issues:** Nervous tension, irritability, restlessness, brain fog, confusion, personality changes, low tolerance to stress, loss of coordination
* **Physical symptoms:** Air hunger, numbness in feet and/or fingertips, hand tremors, low pulse rate, headaches, constipation, insomnia

**How to boost your B1 levels:**

* **Diet:** Include these excellent sources of B1 in your diet:
  * Pork, beef, and organ meats
  * Eggs
  * Fish
  * Nuts
  * Unfortified nutritional yeast
* **Supplements:** Consider these forms of B1, especially if you have blood sugar concerns:
  * **Allithiamine:** A fat-soluble form that easily enters the brain.
  * **Benfotiamine:** Another fat-soluble form that may be beneficial for blood sugar regulation.

If you suspect you have a vitamin B1 deficiency, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.

## Do eggs cause heart disease?

No, eggs do not increase the risk of heart disease. Studies that claim this are flawed and are typically observational studies that can be easily manipulated.

***

## Do healthy individuals require dietary supplements?

Certainly! Achieving optimal health often requires more than just avoiding medications and managing weight. Even if you feel healthy, it's challenging to get all necessary nutrients from food due to depleted soils in the US. This can lead to deficiencies that affect energy levels, inflammation, digestion, adrenal function, and sleep. Supplements can bridge these gaps, especially crucial for detoxification and providing nutrients not adequately supplied by diet alone. I've developed supplements specifically to address these needs and support overall health where it may be weakest due to individual histories and dietary limitations.

***

## Do I really need fiber to avoid constipation?

Constipation is congestion in your gut—you have too much stool. Fiber increases stool volume. Fiber also causes your microbes to create fermentation, which leads to gas and bloating. Some studies suggest that consuming fiber can even worsen conditions like chronic constipation or SIBO. The biggest mistake people make when dealing with constipation is consuming more fiber.

How to deal with constipation naturally:

1\. Reduce your fiber

2\. Talk to your doctor about whether or not it’s a side effect of a medication (and what to do if it is)

3\. Consume vitamin B1

4\. Lower your stress

5\. Take bile salts

6\. Take a probiotic

7\. Do intermittent fasting

8\. Consume a moderate amount of protein

9\. Consume betaine hydrochloride and apple cider vinegar

10\. Consume magnesium and potassium

***

## Do Keto and fasting Increase stress hormones?

Do keto and fasting increase stress hormones? The answer is no.

Some people believe that it appears to be stressful on the body because you're starving the body of glucose. However, a person has fat on their body to be used as fuel. Logically, our bodies are meant to run off of fat between meals.

Cortisol is a stress hormone. It is also called glucocorticoid. One of the major functions of cortisol is to keep your blood sugars from getting too low. It releases stored glucose or causes the production of glucose to maintain blood sugar levels. This isn't a stress event; it's a normal thing that occurs in the body.

It takes about three days for the body to adapt from burning glucose to burning fat. Cortisol can rise a little bit when a person goes through the three-day keto-adaptation phase, but then it levels out.

When you run your body on glucose, it is very stressful for the body, and you can't tap into your own fat. However, when you get into ketosis, you could go from a stress state to a much higher level of calmness and a state of well-being. Burning fat or being in ketosis is a non-stressful state. Keep in mind, that when you start keto and fasting, it's important to take electrolytes and B vitamins.

## Do low fat diets cause gallstones?

### **The Myth of Low-Fat Diets and Gallstones**

Contrary to the misconception that a low-fat diet can ward off gallstones, it is [bile deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-know-if-you-have-bile-deficiency) caused by high insulin levels or other factors like high estrogen, birth control pills, and pregnancy, which is responsible for their formation.

Fats are crucial in triggering bile release, which helps dissolve gallstones.

#### **The Role of Fats in Bile Release**

Fats are not the enemy when [preventing gallstones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-low-fat-diet-to-prevent-gallstones-myth); they're our allies. Consuming fatty foods triggers our body to produce bile and discharge it into the small intestine, assisting in breaking down these fats for digestion.

This process keeps your bile flowing regularly, reducing the risk of gallstone formation. So, eating less fat could increase your chances of developing gallstones because it reduces the need for regular bile release.

![Image](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/video-thumbnails/2c86ddc8-26b2-4f40-9d47-58d4be1a8522.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **How High Insulin Levels Deplete Bile**

In addition to fat consumption playing a crucial role in maintaining healthy bile flow, another important factor is keeping insulin levels under control.

High insulin levels can deplete your body's supply of stored bile salts needed for adequate digestion and absorption of dietary fats.

Consuming large amounts of sugar or refined carbohydrates can cause spikes in blood sugar levels, leading to increased insulin production - setting off a chain reaction that ultimately leads to depleted reserves of vital digestive enzymes like bile acids.

## Do organ meats increase testosterone?

Organ meats are rich in zinc and vitamin D, two nutrients linked to reproductive health and the support of hormonal balance, including testosterone.

***

## Do organ meats increase the risk of Mad Cow disease?

Eating certain parts of animals, such as beef tongue, brain, and spinal cord tissues, can potentially increase the risk of mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). However, thoroughly cooking organ meats and purchasing certified BSE-free products helps significantly minimize the risk of BSE.

***

## Do phytoestrogens have the potential to increase estrogen levels?

The answer is no, not more than you already have in your body.

Phytoestrogens only block receptors for bad estrogen, which automatically raise your relative good estrogen. BUT it will not increase your levels more than you already have. So consuming flax oil or seeds for example are safe for men and women.

## Do you have salad bloating syndrome?

Experiencing bloating after eating salad? You might be one of the many who suffer from Salad Bloating Syndrome. This discomfort isn't just about feeling full; it's often linked to Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) and leaky gut, both of which can lead to nutrient malabsorption and excessive fermentation in the gut.

**Trigger Foods and Dietary Adjustments**

Certain vegetables, particularly those high in lectins like tomatoes and peppers, can be problematic for individuals with increased gut permeability. These lectins can interfere with nutrient absorption and trigger bloating.

To manage symptoms, consider incorporating safe fats like pasture-raised meats, lard, and beef fat, known for their anti-inflammatory properties. Opt for gentler vegetables like cabbage and lettuce over cruciferous options like broccoli and Brussels sprouts.

**Probiotics and Turmeric**

Non-dairy probiotics can be a game-changer in preventing bloating. These beneficial bacteria help break down tough fibers, reducing gas production and promoting healthy digestion.

Turmeric, with its active compound curcumin, offers anti-inflammatory benefits and can help manage gastritis symptoms, often associated with bloating.

**Conclusion**

By understanding the causes and making informed dietary choices, you can manage Salad Bloating Syndrome effectively. Prioritize safe fats, opt for gentler vegetables, and incorporate probiotics and turmeric into your routine for a healthier, happier gut.

## Do you have vertical ridges on your fingernails?

Vertical ridges on nails are typically caused by one of 3 nutrient deficiencies:

1\. Iron deficiency

2\. Zinc deficiency

3\. Biotin deficiency

To determine which nutrient deficiency is causing the vertical ridges on your nails, first, look at your other symptoms. If you have an iron deficiency, you may also experience heavy menstruation and symptoms of anemia. Some people have a genetic problem that causes too much iron. Even with too much iron, you can become anemic because the iron in your body is dysfunctional. Liver problems and blood tests pinpointing a problem with iron could mean your nail ridges are caused by an iron deficiency. Cravings for ice or dirt and feeling cold with cold feet and hands can also signify iron deficiency.

## Does consuming coffee have any adverse effects on liver health?

In fact, coffee has the capacity to protect your liver; it’s hepatoprotective.

The liver’s main job is to detoxify, although overall it has over 500 functions. Coffee has the capacity to protect liver cells and decrease liver enzymes.

**So what’s in coffee that provides this protection?** It’s the phytonutrients (plant-based chemical antioxidants). They help regulate bile. They have anti-inflammatory properties, they can help increase vitamin D, and they stabilize blood sugars.

These phytonutrients can also help lower insulin. Lowered insulin helps your liver because high insulin can damage your liver. Coffee has more antioxidants than tea, even green tea, and red wine. Roasting coffee beans increases the antioxidants. But if you grind the beans and expose the grounds to oxygen, you lose a lot of the antioxidants. So it’s best if there’s a short time between grinding it and drinking it.

**There are many positive things about coffee, but there are also a few negatives.**

First, caffeine can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, responsible for “fight or flight.” It’s like activating your adrenals, causing sleep problems which in turn cause a cascade of health effects. A good idea is to drink just one cup in the morning. If you’re drinking coffee all day and evening, and have fatigue, you’re covering up an underlying problem that needs to be fixed.

**Coffee beans are the most heavily sprayed crop in the world. Choose organic coffee.**

The more caffeine you consume, the more you deplete vitamin B1 (thiamine), calcium and potassium. You may need supplements to replace those.

Out of ten recent studies on eggs and heart disease, all of the studies were observational, and all but two of the studies were self-reported.

Studies that require people to recall everything that they’ve eaten over a period of time are generally inaccurate. People often forget what they’ve eaten and focus on the positive things they can remember eating rather than reporting the negative.

Out of ten recent studies on eggs and heart disease, all of the studies were observational, and all but two of the studies were self-reported.

Studies that require people to recall everything that they’ve eaten over a period of time are generally inaccurate. People often forget what they’ve eaten and focus on the positive things they can remember eating rather than reporting the negative. Questionnaires do not prove causation. There was also a conflict of interest in many of these studies.

Eggs are one of the most nutrient-dense foods you can consume. The egg yolk contains almost every nutrient except vitamin C.

Egg yolks from pasture-raised eggs are an excellent source of the following: •Vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, B12 •The active form of vitamin A (retinol) •Vitamin E •Vitamin K2 •Vitamin D •Omega-3 fatty acids •Potassium, magnesium, and selenium.

Eggs are the best source of protein next to human breast milk and are one of the best sources of choline.

Egg yolks promote healthy levels of cholesterol. They can increase HDL cholesterol and can increase the size of your LDL cholesterol.

Egg yolks are the perfect combination of protein and fat and can help reduce insulin resistance. Egg yolks contain lutein and zeaxanthin—carotenoids that are most commonly found in vegetables. These carotenoids are more bioavailable in eggs and help protect the eye from macular degeneration and cataracts. They also protect the endothelial tissue inside of your arteries.

Eggs don't cause heart problems—they help with heart problems!

## Does hair loss from vitamin D deficiency grow back?

Vitamin D-related hair loss typically grows back once vitamin D levels are restored to healthy levels. It’s important to note that vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, and it can take up to three months to correct a deficiency with vitamin D supplementation. This explains why it can take a considerable amount of time for hair regrowth to occur.

## Does Intermittent Fasting help with COPD?

COPD is a condition triggered by chronic smoking or pollution that causes an inflamed irritated lung which develops scar tissue and obstructs the lungs capacity to receive oxygen and eliminates oxygen.

COPD Symptoms

• Coughing

• Mucus

• Shortness of Breath

• Chronic Adrenals

It is highly recommended to do the combination of the healthy ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting.

Reducing carbs will reduce inflammation and oxidative damage in the body.

1\. Intermittent Fasting is going to drop the inflammation + help clean up scar tissue

2\. Vitamin D (High) and Vitamin K2

3\. Hyperbaric

4\. Pneumatrophin PMG (Standard Process)

## Does long term fasting affect the menstrual cycle?

Yes, it will. Dr Berg has recommended Dr. Mindy Pelz on that topic.

***

## Does magnesium deficiency cause migraines?

The link between magnesium levels and migraines in the morning is supported by research suggesting that:

**Magnesium Deficiency and Migraines:** Studies have shown a correlation between low magnesium levels and an increased frequency and severity of migraines.

* Magnesium plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter regulation, blood vessel tone, and nerve function, all of which are implicated in migraine development.
* **Circadian Rhythm of Magnesium:** Magnesium levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day, being lowest in the morning. This dip in magnesium can trigger migraines in susceptible individuals, explaining why migraines are often more frequent in the morning hours.
* **Magnesium's Mechanisms in Migraine Prevention:** Magnesium is believed to work in several ways to prevent migraines, including:
  * Regulating neurotransmitter release, such as glutamate, which can trigger migraines.
  * Preventing blood vessel constriction in the brain, which can contribute to migraine pain.
  * Reducing inflammation, which plays a role in migraine development.

However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional if you are experiencing migraines before starting any new supplements, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.

## Does my diet affect my knee pain and arthritis?

The foods you eat can have a significant impact on knee pain and arthritis. It all comes down to the balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in your diet.

[Omega-6 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-6-fats-and-inflammation) are found in many common foods, such as vegetable oils and processed snacks. While some omega-6 is necessary for health, consuming too much can contribute to inflammation in the body, which can worsen [knee pain](https://www.drberg.com/blog/knee-pain-relief) and arthritis symptoms.

#### **The Impact of Omega-6 Fatty Acids on Inflammation**

Omega-6 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat that is essential for various bodily functions. However, when consumed in excess, they can promote inflammation.

In fact, research has shown that a diet high in omega-6 fatty acids can increase the production of pro-inflammatory compounds in the body, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

These compounds can contribute to joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in people with knee arthritis. Some common sources of omega-6 fatty acids include:

* Soybean oil
* Corn oil
* Sunflower oil
* Safflower oil
* Processed snacks and baked goods
* Fried foods

## Does my diet impact my dental health?

### **Diet's Impact on Dental Problems**

Although clove oil can be effective for toothaches, it is not a comprehensive solution, and dietary changes may be necessary to address the root cause. Most dental issues stem from diet, especially sugar intake. So, if you always reach for clove oil, it's time to examine your plate.

#### **Sugar's Effect on Teeth**

Sugar and dental problems go hand in hand. Bacteria in your mouth feed on sugar, producing acid that attacks the tooth enamel, leading to cavities.

* **Tooth decay:** High sugar intake leads to cavities.
* [**Gum disease**](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-causes-bleeding-gums)**:** Excess sugar causes plaque buildup, leading to gingivitis.
* **Tooth loss:** Advanced gum disease can damage bones supporting teeth, leading to tooth loss.

Excess sugar consumption can impair the body's natural defenses, increasing the risk of developing abscesses and periodontal diseases.

#### **Long-Term Solutions through Diet Changes**

For long-term dental solutions, a change in diet is the best option. Reducing sugar intake is critical because less sugar means less harmful bacterial activity in our mouths.

* **Avoid processed foods:** Whole foods offer essential vitamins and minerals for healthy teeth and gums.
* **Limited snacking:** Frequent snacking provides a constant fuel source for harmful bacteria. Stick to 2-3 balanced meals per day.
* **Increase water intake:** Drinking water rinses away food particles and aids saliva production, neutralizing destructive acids.

## Does my lifestyle choice deplete calcium?

Certain lifestyle factors, even seemingly unrelated ones, can also deplete your calcium reserves:

* High Protein Intake: While protein is vital, excessively high intake can potentially contribute to calcium loss through urine.
* High Sodium Intake: Similarly, excessive sodium intake may impact calcium balance.
* Excessive Caffeine and Soft Drinks: High caffeine consumption, especially from coffee or certain sodas, may contribute to calcium loss. The high phosphorus content in some sodas can also interfere with calcium balance. This doesn't mean you must entirely forgo your morning cup but be mindful of your overall consumption.
* Refined Sugar Consumption: Excessive refined sugar intake can negatively affect calcium absorption.

## Does potassium deficiency cause diabetes?

Diuretics are commonly used to treat high blood pressure. But, they come with side effects, including an increased risk of developing diabetes. On the flip side, ace inhibitors, also used to treat high blood pressure, protect against diabetes and lower the risk of diabetes. I believe the big difference between these two drugs, when it comes to diabetes risk, is what they do to potassium.

Diuretics deplete potassium, and without enough potassium, insulin can't be released very well. A deficiency of insulin can then lead to diabetes. Ace inhibitors increase potassium by helping to prevent the loss of potassium. So why do we even need a drug—why aren't we just consuming more potassium? Many people support healthy blood pressure and healthy blood sugar levels by taking potassium.

The RDAs for potassium are 4700 mg. It might surprise you, but bananas aren't a good source of potassium. A few of the best sources of potassium are:

• Leafy greens

• Potatoes

• Avocado

• Electrolyte powder

## Does shoulder pain go away?

Shoulder pain can resolve over time with appropriate treatment such as therapeutic exercises and lifestyle modifications like improving sleep posture.

However, some cases may require more advanced interventions, such as surgery, depending on the severity and underlying causes.

***

## Does stress decrease dopamine?

**Long-term stress elevates cortisol and impacts dopamine, affecting pleasure and motivation. Symptoms include reduced pleasure, motivation, alertness, and increased stress.**

**Steps to mitigate:**

1\. Prioritize sleep.

2\. Reduce exposure to fearful stimuli like news.

3\. Engage in regular exercise outdoors.

4\. Address and minimize sources of stress.

***

## Does stress raise the pH of stomach acid?

Stress will lower stomach acid production but does not raise stomach acid pH.

Stress diverts blood flow away from the digestive system, including the stomach, leading to lower production of hydrochloric acid (HCl). Decreased HCl impairs the signal to close the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), allowing acid to reflux into the esophagus, causing heartburn and indigestion.

***

## Does the brain only run on glucose?

People often have an idea that your body — especially your brain — can only run on glucose. But that’s not true! You can run your body on ketones, which provide about forty to seventy percent of the energy you need. Of course, the question becomes, what kind of fuel makes up the difference?There will always be a small amount of glucose, but your body can run on fatty acids. Fat turns into ketones and fatty acids.

Your brain is a little different; it can use ketones for seventy percent of its fuel, with the rest coming from lactate or glucose. Where will you get the glucose if you don’t want to eat carbohydrates? Your body makes its own in a process called gluconeogenesis. Your body uses fat and protein to make glucose. Certain amino acids in protein turn into glucose, as does a component of fat which breaks down into glycerol, then converts to glucose. Your body can easily get the glucose it needs from fat and protein. You don’t need carbohydrates to supply glucose.

***

## Does the consumption of water play a role in the formation of kidney stones?

The most common type of kidney stone is calcium oxalate. Consuming calcium helps prevent stones by binding with oxalates in the digestive system, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream and accumulation in the kidneys. Drinking mineral water does not cause kidney stones.

**Foods high in oxalates:**

\- Almonds

\- Spinach

\- Kiwi

\- Beets

\- Chocolate

**Recommendations:**

\- Avoid high-oxalate foods if prone to stones

\- Consume calcium with oxalate-rich foods

\- Prefer calcium citrate, magnesium, orotate, or lactate over calcium carbonate

\- Maintain adequate fluid intake (at least 2.5 liters daily)

***

## Does the Gallbladder absorb fat?

No, the gallbladder does not directly absorb fat. Its primary function is to store and concentrate bile produced by the liver. Bile aids in breaking down dietary fats into smaller particles, which are then absorbed by the small intestine.

***

## Does the sun have any effect on eye health?

Protecting our skin from harmful UV rays is crucial, and so is protecting our eyes from sun damage. Prolonged exposure to UV radiation harms the eyes and can accelerate cataracts and macular degeneration.

Make it a habit to wear sunglasses that offer 100% UV protection whenever you are outside, even on cloudy days, as UV rays can penetrate clouds.

Prioritizing eye protection, especially during peak sun hours, significantly contributes to maintaining good eye health. Sunglasses are a simple way to protect your eye health.

***

## Does zinc carnosine help manage stomach acidity?

Zinc carnosine supports balanced stomach acid production, which prevents excessive stomach acidity linked to acid reflux and heartburn and an increased risk of gastric ulcers.

## Effective Nutritional Treatments for Common Eye Conditions

### **Effective Nutritional Treatments for Common Eye Conditions**

While a balanced diet is essential for overall eye health, certain nutrients can also be used to target specific eye conditions.

From pesky allergies to more serious autoimmune disorders, the right combination of vitamins and minerals can work wonders in alleviating symptoms and promoting healing. Let's take a closer look at some effective nutritional treatments for common eye issues.

#### **Treating Conjunctivitis with Zinc and Colloidal Silver**

[Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye](https://www.drberg.com/blog/colloidal-silver-pink-eye), is a highly contagious inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin membrane that covers the white part of the eye.

While viral conjunctivitis often clears up, supplementing with zinc and colloidal silver can speed up the healing process.

Zinc has potent antiviral properties that can help fight off the infection, while colloidal silver acts as a natural antibiotic to reduce inflammation and prevent secondary bacterial infections.

To avoid any potential side effects, be sure to use a high-quality, sterile solution and follow the recommended dosage.

#### **Alleviating Allergy Symptoms with Vitamin A**

If you suffer from seasonal allergies, you know how miserable they can make your eyes feel - red, itchy, watery, and just plain uncomfortable. But did you know that vitamin A can be a powerful ally in the fight against allergy symptoms?

Vitamin A helps to support the health of the mucous membranes in your eyes, which act as a natural barrier against allergens and irritants.

[Cod liver oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-real-reason-why-you-should-take-cod-liver-oil-dr-berg) is an excellent vitamin A source, and a daily supplement can help reduce inflammation and soothe allergy-induced redness and irritation.

#### **The Anti-inflammatory Benefits of Vitamin D for Autoimmune Disorders**

[Autoimmune disorders](https://www.drberg.com/blog/whats-at-the-root-of-an-autoimmune-condition) like uveitis and Sjogren's syndrome can cause severe inflammation in the eyes, leading to pain, vision changes, and even permanent damage if left untreated.

But research shows that vitamin D can be a powerful anti-inflammatory agent for managing these conditions.

[Vitamin D](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-facts-about-vitamin-d-you-never-knew) helps to regulate the immune system and prevent it from attacking healthy tissues in the body, including the eyes.

Supplementing with vitamin D3, the most bioavailable form of the nutrient, can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms of autoimmune-related eye disorders. Just be sure to work with your doctor to determine the right dosage for your specific needs.

In addition to these targeted treatments, maintaining adequate vitamin A levels is crucial for preventing dry eyes, a common symptom of many eye conditions.

If you struggle with vitamin A absorption due to digestive issues, adding purified bile salts to your supplement regimen can help enhance absorption and ensure your eyes are getting the nourishment they need.

## Exercise for Healthy Aging

### **Exercise for Healthy Aging**

Aging doesn't mean we have to give up our vitality. With regular exercise, we can combat the effects of aging and maintain our health into old age.

#### **Maintaining Muscle Mass**

As we get older, muscle loss is a common problem. Did you know that regular exercise can help to sustain muscle mass and strength even as we age? It's true. Exercise helps preserve muscle mass and strength as you age, keeping you active and independent longer.

#### **Fighting Chronic Diseases**

Sedentary habits contribute to over 35 chronic illnesses, including obesity, diabetes, cancer, and stroke.[Research shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4241367) that regular physical activity reduces risk factors associated with these diseases, making it an essential tool in healthy aging.

#### **Promoting Brain Health**

Your brain also benefits from a good workout. Exercise stimulates neurogenesis - growth of new neurons - which improves memory function and mood regulation. Studies indicate that this can lower the risk of dementia or other cognitive disorders in later life.

#### **Aiding Metabolic Health**

If managing weight or controlling blood sugar levels has been a struggle, consider incorporating more physical activity into your routine.

Regular workouts improve insulin sensitivity and aid in weight management, reducing risks related to metabolic syndrome like fatty liver disease. Evidence suggests this approach leads to better overall health and longevity.

## Fatty Acid Deficiency - Despite Taking Essential Fatty Acids - EFA?

I heard from someone who had symptoms of an essential fatty acid deficiency, even though they were taking essential fatty acids (EFA). EFAs are omega 3 and omega 6. Here are the symptoms of a deficiency:

● Small red bumps on the back of your arms

● Dry, scaly skin

● Hair loss

● Loss of pigment in your hair

● Heart issues

● Vision problems

● Mood issues

● Problems with cognitive function

If you’re taking essential fatty acids and not seeing a change in your body, then you know you’re not absorbing them. Here are the potential reasons why:

● Pancreatic insufficiency

● Insufficient stomach acid

● Intestinal issues like irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn’s

● Gallbladder problems such as lack of gallbladder, or one that’s congested

● Liver issues such as fatty liver, hepatitis, or cirrhosis

The last two on this list are the most common reasons why someone isn’t properly absorbing essential fatty acids. If you have a big belly, chances are you have a fatty liver. An ultrasound can confirm. This results from insulin resistance, which itself is caused by consuming things like alcohol and refined sugars, and eating far too often. As well, if you have a fatty liver then chances are you have a congested gallbladder.

These are good sources of essential fatty acids:

● Eggs

● Fish

● Fish oil

● Olives and olive oil

● Vegetables

● Nuts

● Seeds

● Grass-fed animal products such as meat and cheese

I hope this answered the question about how you can develop an essential fatty acid deficiency!

## Folic Acid and B12 Deficiency

### **The Masking Effect of Folic Acid on B12 Deficiency**

[Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate](https://www.drberg.com/blog/avoid-folic-acid-and-take-folate-as-methyl-folate), a B vitamin that's essential for DNA synthesis and red blood cell production. It's often added to fortified foods like breakfast cereals and breads to help prevent neural tube defects in pregnancy.

But while folic acid fortification has been successful in reducing the incidence of these birth defects, it may also be masking a hidden problem: vitamin B12 deficiency.

![Pills forming B12 shape](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/yellow-pills-forming-shape-b12-alphabet-0.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **Fortified Foods and Nutrient Interactions**

The problem with folic acid is that it can correct the megaloblastic anemia caused by B12 deficiency, but it doesn't address the underlying deficiency itself.

This means that someone could have a serious B12 deficiency but not show any obvious symptoms because the folic acid is masking the anemia.

Over time, untreated B12 deficiency can lead to irreversible neurological damage, even if the anemia is being corrected by folic acid. This is why it's so important to test for B12 deficiency, especially in older adults and vegetarians/vegans who may be at a higher risk.

While food fortification can be a useful tool for preventing nutrient deficiencies, it's important to be aware of potential interactions between nutrients like folic acid and B12.

If you're relying on fortified foods as a major source of your B vitamins, make sure also to include plenty of B12-rich foods in your diet or consider supplementing to ensure you're meeting your needs.

## Gallstones vs. Kidney Stones

### **Gallstones vs. Kidney Stones**

Understanding the [difference between gallstones and kidney stones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-do-stones-develop-in-your-kidney-and-gallbladder) is essential if you want to prevent gallbladder disease.

Both conditions involve hard deposits forming in your body, but they occur in different areas and have unique causes.

![Image](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/video-thumbnails/0aaff09d-5988-4a10-87c1-3ae29fd2b517.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **Kidney Stones**

Kidney stones develop when calcium oxalate accumulates in your kidneys—a process often influenced by dehydration rather than fat consumption.

Drinking lots of water daily helps dilute substances that could form kidney stones while promoting regular urination, which aids their expulsion from the body before they grow too large.

Although both conditions share similar names—and even some common symptoms—the strategies for preventing them differ greatly based on their distinct underlying causes.

## Healthy Habits for Managing Illness

### **Healthy Habits for Managing Illness**

Iron is essential, but too much can feed disease-causing microbes. Luckily, there are safer alternatives that support immunity without encouraging microbial growth.

#### **Immunity-Boosting Nutrients**

A balanced diet rich in essential nutrients strengthens the body's defenses against harmful pathogens without promoting their growth like excess iron might.

* [**Vitamin C**](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-4-things-about-vitamin-c-that-will-blow-you-away)**:** Stimulates white blood cell production to fight infections. It is found in broccoli.
* [**Zinc**](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-unexpected-amazing-benefits-of-zinc-that-you-ve-rarely-heard-about)**:** Aids cell division and growth while having an anti-inflammatory effect. Found in oysters, beef, and pumpkin seeds.
* [**Selenium**](https://www.drberg.com/blog/12-amazing-benefits-of-selenium)**:** Boosts defense against bacterial and viral infections. It is found in Brazil nuts, seafood, turkey, and chicken.

These nutrients not only support immune function during sickness but also aid recovery.

![Woman eating vegetables](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/young-happy-woman-eating-healthy-salad.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **Dietary Changes for Better Health**

During sickness, nutritional changes can enhance overall health status:

* **Eat Whole Foods:** Unprocessed or minimally processed foods contain more natural nutrients than heavily processed ones.
* **Maintain Hydration:** Staying hydrated helps maintain bodily functions. Consume eight glasses of H2O daily or more if experiencing signs of dehydration such as fever, perspiration, vomiting, looseness of the bowels, or other symptoms.
* **Cut Back On Sugar:** Sugar lacks nutritional value and weakens the immune response by reducing the white blood cell activity necessary to fight infection. Limit consumption of sugary drinks, snacks, and desserts, particularly when under the weather.

Advise a medical specialist before adjusting your diet or taking dietary supplements to ensure safety and efficiency.

## How can fatty liver disease contribute to a slowdown in thyroid function?

Fatty liver disease can stem from excessive alcohol consumption or a diet high in sugars and refined carbohydrates, leading to insulin spikes and insulin resistance. This condition, known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), causes liver inflammation and scar tissue formation.

Common signs include abdominal obesity and can be diagnosed via ultrasound, revealing diminished liver function and reduced bile production. A fatty liver impairs cholesterol regulation and interferes with thyroid hormone conversion (T4 to T3), potentially leading to hypothyroidism and metabolic slowdown.

Addressing these issues with a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting can alleviate insulin resistance symptoms. Increasing intake of cruciferous and other vegetables, along with choline supplements, supports the removal of fat from the liver, aiding in the reversal of fatty liver disease over time.

## How can I determine if I am salt sensitive or potassium deficient?

People that are salt sensitive are usually told to stay away from sodium. But did you know that we need 1000mg of sodium and 4700mg of potassium RDA? If you are deficient in sodium, you experience headaches, fatigue, lethargy, nausea, and weak muscles. Sodium and potassium work together. Instead of accepting the diagnosis that you need to cut down your salt, try to increase your potassium intake to 4700mg daily. This will especially help with high blood pressure. Increase your potassium by taking supplements, but it's best to eat 7-10 cups of vegetables.

## How can I end seizures?

**Common triggers of seizures:**

• Fever

• Head injury

• Brain infection

• Choking

• Alcohol

• Drug withdrawal

• Extremely low blood sugar

• Drugs

• Toxins

• Stress

• High blood pressure

Data shows that keto is effective in eliminating seizures by a factor of 50 to 70 percent. But it's important to be on the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. The keto diet for epilepsy also includes more fat than protein. Ketones are a byproduct of fat. Fat and ketones are the primary fuel source that our bodies should run on—not glucose. It's also the preferred fuel source of the brain.

**Top potential benefits of ketones for seizures:**

• They have anticonvulsant properties

• They stabilize the excitability of the neurons

• They modulate neurotransmitters

• They support the brain, including the hippocampus

• They increase the hippocampus's mitochondrial biogenesis

• They protect the brain and neurons against oxidative stress

• They increase the ATP in the neurons to allow them to function better

## How can I end the hypertension?

Blood pressure problems are very common. Today, we’re going to talk about blood pressure and the best natural hypertension remedies. The problems with high blood pressure can extend way beyond the heart. High blood pressure can affect the brain, eyes, and kidneys. High blood pressure can also increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. In my opinion, two common causes of high blood pressure are low magnesium and low vitamin D. But hypertension could also be the result of another health issue, like hypoxia.

The typical treatment for hypertension involves lowering sodium intake or taking a diuretic. But, diuretics deplete potassium and magnesium, which could both be potential causes of high blood pressure in the first place. Calcium channel blockers and ace inhibitors are also used to treat high blood pressure, but those come with serious potential side effects. A research study also found that taking aspirin every day may not have any benefits.

Nitric oxide, on the other hand, supports the inner layer of the arteries and may help lower blood pressure. A certain enzyme in the body helps make nitric oxide. But, this enzyme can be inhibited if you have a specific genetic variation.

**One of the best natural remedies for hypertension is L-arginine.** L-arginine supports the production of nitric oxide in the body. Other great natural remedies for high blood pressure are foods like garlic and celery, which you can easily include in your diet. You may also want to take tocotrienols to support the arteries and make sure you’re getting plenty of potassium, magnesium, and vitamin D3. Changing your diet is another crucial part of dealing with high blood pressure.

## How can I fix the deficiencies behind the vertical ridges on my fingernails?

Most of your biotin is made by your microbes, so a history of antibiotic use can contribute to biotin deficiency. Biotin deficiency symptoms include brittle hair, thin nails, neurological problems, and peripheral neuropathy. Biotin, zinc, and iron control collagen. A deficiency in either of these nutrients can cause vertical lines on the nails.

Once you identify which nutrient you are most likely deficient in, you can increase your intake of certain foods or supplements to fix the problem.

Grass-fed liver pills or spleen extract pills are the best option for an iron deficiency.

To increase zinc, consume more shellfish, oysters, and grass-fed beef. If you choose to take a supplement for zinc, take 50 grams in a blend with other trace minerals, including copper.

If you have a biotin deficiency, try increasing your biotin with a supplement. Take a good probiotic to support gut health, which will naturally help increase biotin.

***

## How can I flush excess zinc from the body?

To flush excess zinc from your system, increase copper intake through diet or supplementation, stay hydrated, maintain trace mineral balance, and avoid zinc supplements and zinc-rich foods. In addition, it’s recommended to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

***

## How can I get rid of excess uric acid naturally?

Managing excess uric acid levels, often associated with conditions like gout or kidney stones, can be effectively addressed through natural approaches:

1\. **Avoiding Fructose:** Limiting consumption of sugary foods and beverages helps to lower uric acid levels.

2\. **Consideration of Carnivore Diet:** Some individuals experience relief by reducing carbohydrates and sugars, focusing on a meat-based diet.

3\. **Understanding Uric Acid Dynamics:** Initially, ketogenic diets may temporarily elevate uric acid levels as the body adapts, potentially providing antioxidant benefits. Intermittent fasting can aid in normalizing uric acid levels over time.

For personalized advice and detailed strategies, consulting with healthcare professionals or referring to comprehensive resources is recommended.

## How can I handle the bloating for good?

Ninety percent of digestion occurs in the small intestine, where bile and secondary bile salts made by your microbes break down your food. The large intestine, small intestine, and pancreas release enzymes to aid digestion. Around 20% of these enzymes are made by your microbes. Bloating is caused by a problem with digestion. The type, amount, and diversity of your gut bacteria directly affect bloating. This often depends on if you’ve taken antibiotics and how much you’ve taken over time.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics significantly reduce your microbes, and they do not come back! If you’re missing any of your gut microbes, you’ll experience bloating, gas, burping, constipation, and more. Other chemicals in the environment that mimic antibiotics can also cause a bloated belly. Glyphosate, birth control pills, steroids, anti-depression medications, PPIs, artificial sweeteners, fluoride, and statins can all contribute to bloating.

So many people can not properly digest food anymore because they don’t have all of their microbes in sufficient quantities. A high-quality probiotic is a great solution to bloating. Along with probiotics, consume fermented foods regularly, such as kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut, and pickles. Apple cider vinegar and kombucha can also help awaken dormant microbes by acidifying their environment. These microbes help support your bile and enzymes, helping you digest food, which takes stress off your organs.

1. **Cruciferous Vegetables**: Incorporating cruciferous vegetables like kale, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts into your diet is beneficial. These vegetables contain compounds that help balance estrogen levels.
2. **DIM Supplement Estrogen Balance**: Dr. Berg recommends the DIM Supplement Estrogen Balance supplement. DIM (Diindolylmethane) is a compound derived from cruciferous vegetables that supports healthy estrogen metabolism and helps balance estrogen levels in the body.
3. **Iodine Supplementation**: Iodine is essential for maintaining a healthy thyroid, which plays a crucial role in hormone regulation, including estrogen. Dr. Berg mentions getting iodine from sea kelp as a natural way to supplement iodine.
4. **Nettle Root**: Nettle root is highlighted as a natural aromatase inhibitor. Aromatase is an enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen. By inhibiting this enzyme, nettle root can help lower estrogen levels.
5. **Organic Meat**: It is recommended that you consume meat from grass-fed animals to avoid GMOs from corn and soy feed, which can influence estrogen levels.

These recommendations aim to support the body's natural hormone balance, reduce high estrogen levels, and address symptoms of estrogen dominance. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement or dietary regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions.

## How can I possibly improve sperm count and quality?

Ways to Increase Sperm Count and Quality:

Dietary Changes:

Avoid Soy Products: Soy has been directly associated with lowering sperm count due to its rich content of isoflavones, which are phytoestrogens and may act as endocrine disruptors. Common soy products include: Keto-friendly bars containing soy isolates Diet shakes Vegetarian or vegan meat substitutes Soy milk Reduce Exposure to Endocrine

Disruptors: Choose Organic Products: Opt for organic foods to avoid exposure to chemicals that can disrupt hormones.

Avoid Phthalates: Use products labeled as "phthalate-free" and avoid fast food, which can be a source of phthalate exposure. Use Microwave-Safe Containers: Ensure that containers and plastic wraps used in microwaves are labeled as "microwave-safe."

Manage Estrogen Levels: Monitor and Reduce Elevated Estrogen:

Elevated estrogen in men can lead to a decline in sperm count and other symptoms such as infertility, erectile dysfunction, and reduced sex drive. Managing estrogen levels can help improve sperm production.

Consider Supplements: Zinc: This mineral is essential for male fertility.

Omega-3 Fatty Acids: These healthy fats can improve sperm quality.

Vitamin E: This antioxidant can help protect sperm from damage.

Healthy Lifestyle Choices:

Follow a Healthy Keto Diet: A diet high in healthy fats and low in processed foods can support overall reproductive health.

Reduce Stress: Lowering stress levels can improve fertility.

Summary: Avoid Soy: Soy products can lower sperm count.

Reduce Endocrine Disruptors: Choose organic, phthalate-free products and use microwave-safe containers.

Manage Estrogen: Keep estrogen levels in check to support sperm production.

Consider Supplements: Zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin E can be beneficial.

Healthy Lifestyle: Follow a healthy diet and reduce stress.

## How can I speed up muscle growth?

**Skeletal muscle is crucial for movement, posture, and metabolism. Building muscle requires a combination of high-intensity exercise and adequate protein intake. Aim for 0.8 to 1.5 grams of high-quality protein per kilogram of lean body mass (athletes may need up to 2 grams). To further optimize muscle growth, consider the following strategies:**

* **Creatine Supplementation:** Creatine boosts energy during intense exercise. Load with 20 grams for five days, then maintain with 3 grams daily in a cyclical pattern.
* **Cold Therapy:** Cold showers, immersion, or cryotherapy stimulate fat burning and muscle development by increasing muscle gene expression and reducing inflammation.
* **Intermittent Fasting:** Fasting boosts growth hormone for muscle growth and improves insulin sensitivity, aiding muscle recovery. Aim for two calorie-dense meals daily without snacking.
* **Arginine:** This amino acid promotes growth hormone production. Take 3-6 grams daily on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before workouts.

**Important Note:** Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement or dietary regimen.

## How can I tell if I have high estrogen?

Aside from issues with your menstrual cycle, low progesterone is a sign of too much estrogen because these two hormones balance each other out.

Gallstones can be a sign of estrogen dominance because estrogen helps concentrate cholesterol in the gallbladder. This is why gallstones are sometimes seen after pregnancy due to the spike in estrogen. Thyroid issues can also signify an estrogen imbalance.

## How can I use my feet to determine if I have an ongoing health condition?

The foot receives oxygen and nutrition from the heart through tiny capillaries. The following feet symptoms are also potential signs of diseases.

1\. Peripheral neuropathy

This shows up as numbness or burning in the feet due to low vitamin B1 (thiamine). Benfotiamine, a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1, may help.

2\. Fingers or toes turn blue

This can be related to an overactive sympathetic nervous system. This is often treated medically with calcium channel blockers. Magnesium is a natural calcium channel blocker and the primary regulator of calcium inside the cells. Magnesium glycinate is the most absorbable form of magnesium.

3\. Foot cramps

Foot cramps and charlie horses in the calves are among the earliest signs of magnesium deficiency. Try taking 400 to 800 mg of magnesium glycinate for several weeks to alleviate foot cramps.

4\. Swollen feet

Swelling of feet typically involves diabetes and excess sugar in the blood, which causes sodium and water retention. The solution is to remove sugar from the diet.

5\. Discoloration of lower legs and feet

This is often caused by a circulation problem. Deep vein thrombosis is a condition where you develop clots in the veins of the lower legs. This can cause fluid retention and discoloration of the lower legs and feet.

6\. Big toe pain

Pain in the big toe is usually a symptom of gout caused by too much uric acid. Decreasing oxalates in the diet can sometimes solve this problem. Magnesium can also help decrease oxalates.

## How do cortisol levels influence sleep patterns?

Between about 12am and 2am, you should have the lowest amount of cortisol. The highest level of cortisol is between 6am and 9 am. But, in some cases, cortisol can get higher during the night and counter deep sleep. You might be sleeping, but you’re not getting deep sleep or restful sleep.

There can be a problem with different parts of the brain that are activated and then prevent you from getting restful sleep, all because your cortisol will not turn off. The goal is not to keep cortisol at zero but to help normalize cortisol, so you don’t have anything interfering with your sleep cycles. But, you still need to have the function of cortisol, which is vital.

**What to do about high cortisol:**

• Figure out what’s causing you stress and do what you can to handle it

• Go for long walks (45-60 minutes every day outside and disconnected)

• Try my do it yourself acupressure technique

## How do I address digestive concerns before reintroducing acidic substances?

Suppose you experience digestive issues like stomach irritation or ulcers after consuming apple cider vinegar or kombucha. In that case, giving your digestive system time to heal is essential before reintroducing these acidic substances into your diet.

#### **Healing Strategies**

Several natural remedies can help soothe the stomach lining and promote healing. One effective strategy is to consume foods rich in [chlorophyll](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-power-of-chlorophyll-for-the-gut), such as leafy greens, wheatgrass, and chlorella.

Chlorophyll has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and can help reduce stomach irritation.

Another helpful remedy is to drink cabbage juice or consume fermented foods like sauerkraut. These foods are rich in beneficial bacteria that can help restore the balance of gut flora and promote digestive tract healing.

It's important to note that if you experience persistent burning or irritation in your stomach after consuming apple cider vinegar or kombucha, it may indicate an underlying condition such as an ulcer or gastritis.

It's best to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment in these cases.

## How do I keep my immune system in check?

### **The Immune System: Our Body's Defense Force**

Your immune system is like a highly trained military force, working tirelessly to defend your body against invading pathogens.

It's a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that join forces to identify and neutralize harmful substances like bacteria, viruses, and toxins.

Think of your immune system as having two main branches: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. They work together to keep you healthy but have different roles and strategies.

#### **Understanding Innate vs. Adaptive Immunity**

Your innate immune system is your first line of defense. It includes physical barriers like your skin and mucous membranes and general immune responses like [inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-3-hidden-causes-of-inflammation-you-havent-heard-about) and phagocytosis (where immune cells engulf and destroy invaders).

The innate immune system is non-specific - it attacks anything it recognizes as foreign.

In contrast, the adaptive immune system is more targeted. It develops specific antibodies and immune cells tailored to fight off particular pathogens that you've been exposed to before.

This is why you typically only get diseases like chickenpox once - your adaptive immunity remembers the virus and is ready to fight it off if it ever tries to invade again.

#### **The Role of the Thymus Gland in Immune Training**

The [thymus gland](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-does-our-thymus-shrink-to-nothing-as-we-age) in your chest is like a boot camp for T-cells - a critical part of your adaptive immune system. Immature T-cells are "trained" in the thymus to recognize the difference between your body's own cells and foreign invaders.

This training process is rigorous—only about 30% of T-cells make it through. The rest are eliminated to prevent autoimmune reactions, in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues.

The thymus is most active during childhood and starts to shrink after puberty, but it continues to play a role in immune regulation throughout life.

Did you know that the internal skin of the body covers an area of about 400 square meters? That's a lot of territory for your immune system to patrol. Beneath the surface of your skin, billions of immune cells are constantly on the lookout for any signs of trouble.

## How do I know if I have a stomach ulcer?

The tell-tale burning and gnawing on an empty is the most common sign of an ulcer. Eating will usually soothe an ulcer and aggravate heartburn. Drinking apple cider vinegar mixed with water will help soothe heartburn but aggravate an ulcer. Some doctors will perform an endoscopy to look for an ulcer.

***

## How do I know if my supplement contains maltodextrin?

Iodine mixed with water is a golden color. If you combine iodine with starch, it turns blue. When you add iodine to bread, for example, it turns blue. Or, if you put maltodextrin in water and add a few drops of iodine, the water will turn blue. My brand of electrolyte powder doesn’t have any sugar or maltodextrin in it. However, when we look at a competitor’s electrolyte powder that also claims it doesn’t have sugar or maltodextrin, it turns blue when iodine is added.

Maltodextrin behaves like sugar, spiking insulin, but can be classified on a label as a carb and not a sugar. On the glycemic index, table sugar is at 65, and glucose is at 100—maltodextrin is between 105 and 185. Maltodextrin is the most common starch added to supplements and other products. If there is less than one gram of maltodextrin in a product per serving size, the company doesn’t even have to state it. Maltodextrin can also be found in flavorings, energy gels, sports powders, and even baby formulas. It’s important to be aware that some so-called keto-friendly products can also contain maltodextrin.

## How do I test for magnesium deficiency?

While blood tests do provide some insight into circulating magnesium levels, a magnesium loading test is generally considered a more accurate measurement of the body’s total magnesium stores.

This test administers magnesium intravenously and measures urinary output, which provides a more accurate assessment of magnesium status.

***

## How do microbes help the body?

We have ten times more microbes living on and inside our bodies than we have cells. Microbes have many functions and help us in various ways, including:

• Helping to make nutrients available

• Providing immune protection

• Protecting against pathogens

• Supporting detoxification

• Improving digestion

• Helping to make vitamins

***

## How do Omega-6 fatty acids potentially contribute to the development of clogged arteries?

Omega-6 Fatty acids, as contained in certain oils, can cause inflammation across the body and eventually result in clogged arteries. You should avoid these fatty acids while substituting omega-3 fatty acids that have anti-inflammatory properties.

***

## How do you manage GERD symptoms if you don’t have a gallbladder?

GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) can persist after gallbladder removal due to issues with the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) valve. Here’s a professional approach to alleviate symptoms:

1\. **Enhance Stomach Acid**: Betaine hydrochloride (HCl) supplements can help acidify the stomach, prompting the LES valve to close properly. Begin with three capsules before meals and gradually increase to find the optimal dosage that reduces reflux.

2\. **Adjust Dosage**: Increase betaine HCl intake daily until symptoms improve. This may require adjusting the dosage up to nine or ten capsules per meal initially, maintaining this regimen for several weeks to assess effectiveness.

By addressing stomach acidity with betaine HCl supplementation, you can potentially improve LES function and alleviate GERD symptoms, despite not having a gallbladder. Always consult with a healthcare provider to tailor the approach to your specific health needs.

***

## How does a fatty liver contribute to the onset of arthritis?

There are different stages of liver damage: fatty liver, fatty liver with inflammation, and cirrhosis. Arthritis is inflammation in your joints. How does the inflammation get from the liver to the joints?

There are several mechanisms in play here. Liver fat creates cytokines, which are proteins that cause inflammation. The particular cytokines that liver fat produces increases systemic inflammation—or inflammation throughout your body.

These cytokines released by liver fat are why you can get inflammation in your joints and arthritis when you have liver disease.

To make things worse, cytokines can worsen insulin resistance. Insulin resistance makes getting rid of fat very difficult and increases even more systemic inflammation. This is a feedback loop that gets worse and worse. When the liver is inflamed and filled with scar tissue, bile gets stuck. In turn, this can cause even more inflammation in the body and nutrient deficiencies.

## How does Big Pharma profit off of sick people?

There are over 100 clinical trials supporting that type 2 diabetes can be reversed in as little as 10 weeks. Hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and other chronic diseases can potentially also be reversed with dietary changes. The reversal rate of type 2 diabetes with the standard of care from doctors is 0.1%. In clinical trials with patients following a keto diet, the reversal rate is more than 50%!

Insulin manufacturers and other drug companies primarily fund the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association, so they are subject to direct conflicts of interest. Doctors have been taught to recommend low-fat diets, and there are countless baseless claims that keto is dangerous.

Dietary guidelines significantly influence most Americans. By law, all federal food programs are required to follow these guidelines. Health professionals also use them as the gold standard in nutrition. However, many conflicts of interest are involved in these guidelines, including ties to both Big Food and Big Pharma.

Giving accurate dietary guidelines to the American public is the best way to combat chronic disease.

To get into a healthy state of ketosis, you should eat eggs, dairy, meat, shellfish, vegetables, and low-sugar fruits. Carbohydrates trigger hunger. Without glucose, your body can access your fat stores for energy between meals.

## How does calcification happen?

Picture this: your cells are little cities. They need the right balance of minerals to function smoothly. When you don't have enough magnesium, calcium can build up inside those cells, causing dysfunction and, eventually, cell death.

This can contribute to heart disease, kidney stones, and even vision problems.

Think of magnesium as the "chill pill" for your cells, preventing this dangerous calcium buildup. It ensures that calcium is directed to the right places.

Now, this isn't an overnight thing. Pathological calcification builds slowly over time, often silently. And there are other factors at play - inflammation is a huge driver. But, magnesium deficiency is a major player we can actually do something about.

***

## How does chronic inflammation contribute to the development of anemia?

**Inflammation**

Our body bacteria (good and bad) use iron to grow. When there is inflammation, your body tends to lock up iron as a protective mechanism in order to prevent bad bacteria from growing.

## How does chronic worry negatively impact physical health?

Being in fight-or-flight mode, having elevated cortisol and adrenaline for a long period, isn’t healthy.

**Chronic stress has been known to negatively affect the body in many ways, including:**

• Shrinking your grey matter

• Shrinking your thymus gland

• Creating muscle atrophy

• Decreasing testosterone

• Running the body on sugar (even when you’re not eating sugar)

• Disrupting healthy digestion

• Reducing quality sleep

Chronic worry and stress can also lead to ulcers, inflammation, and disease. An interesting study measured 39 people’s cortisol levels before and after a 45-minute art therapy session. This study found a significant reduction of cortisol in participants. I have found that hobbies are a fantastic way to stop the fixation on stress and move your attention to something more positive.

## How does coffee affect the adrenals?

Excessive coffee consumption stimulates cortisol production, disrupting natural sleep patterns and potentially leading to adrenal fatigue. Despite its initial wakefulness benefits, over-reliance on coffee can cause chronic tiredness and increased caffeine dependency.

Moderate coffee intake to support adrenal health:

\- Limit consumption to avoid cortisol spikes.

\- Monitor caffeine intake for balanced energy levels.

\- Consider alternatives like herbal teas.

\- Prioritize sufficient sleep and stress management.

Consult with a healthcare provider for personalized guidance on optimizing caffeine intake and maintaining adrenal health.

## How does cortisol affect the body, particularly in terms of protein metabolism, and what mechanisms lead to protein breakdown and muscle loss during prolonged elevated levels?

High cortisol levels, triggered by stress, significantly impact the breakdown of proteins into amino acids. Cortisol induces a catabolic effect, breaking down muscle protein and diverting amino acids away from muscle absorption. Instead, these amino acids are processed in the liver through deamination, producing ammonia and carbon skeletons.

This process occurs as the body enters survival mode, converting proteins into sugar to meet immediate energy needs. Prolonged high cortisol levels are associated with conditions like autoimmune disease, where the immune system targets healthy tissues. Managing stress to lower cortisol levels is crucial for optimizing protein metabolism and maintaining overall health.

## How does diet influence sleep quality, and what specific foods or nutritional habits can enhance or disrupt restful sleep?

On a high-carb, low-fat diet, you’re going to be more deficient in zinc. Zinc can greatly influence parts of the brain that control sleep. If you have a sleeping problem, taking zinc before bed may help. You will also be hungry all of the time. On the other hand, if you’re on a low-carb, high-fat diet, you won’t be as deficient in zinc. You will also have decreased hunger.

If you have poor sleep (in quality and quantity), you will notice an increase in the desire to eat. Poor sleep equals more hunger. One study found that poor REM sleep increases the absorption of glucose, which spikes blood sugars, which affects insulin, which makes you hungry. Also, if you’re not sleeping, you could have high cortisol, which can also lead to an increased appetite.

***

## How does dietary fiber influence blood sugar levels, and what mechanisms underlie its role in regulating glucose metabolism?

Fiber plays a crucial role in moderating blood sugar levels by affecting the glycemic load of foods. Foods high in fiber, like carrots, have a low glycemic load because fiber slows the absorption of carbohydrates, preventing rapid spikes in blood sugar. For example, despite carrots having a relatively high glycemic index of 72, their glycemic load is very low at 3 due to their fiber content. In contrast, foods with low fiber, such as potatoes, can have a high glycemic load, with a boiled potato scoring 31. Therefore, incorporating high-fiber foods can help stabilize blood sugar levels by reducing the glycemic load, just be sure to check the glycemic index before consumption.

## How does insulin resistance turn into diabetes?

Insulin resistance is a precursor to prediabetes and [type 2 diabetes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/type-2-diabetes-is-an-fat-storing-hormone-disease-more-than-a-glucose-disease). Understanding the progression from insulin resistance to these conditions can help you take proactive steps to prevent or manage them.

#### **The Downgrading of Insulin Receptors**

In insulin resistance, the insulin receptors on your cells become less sensitive to insulin, making it harder for glucose to enter the cells. To compensate, your pancreas produces more insulin to overcome the resistance and maintain normal blood sugar levels.

However, the increased demand for insulin can gradually downgrade the insulin receptors over time, further exacerbating insulin resistance.

A study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation found that chronic hyperinsulinemia (high insulin levels) can reduce insulin receptor expression and function.

#### **The Transition from Prediabetes to Diabetes**

[Prediabetes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/most-people-have-prediabetes-and-do-not-even-know-it) is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than usual but not high enough to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes.

In prediabetes, the pancreas's compensatory mechanisms begin to fail, and insulin production may not be sufficient to maintain normal blood sugar levels.

If left unmanaged, prediabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes, where the pancreas's beta cells become exhausted and can no longer produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels effectively.

According to the American Diabetes Association, up to 70% of individuals with prediabetes will eventually develop type 2 diabetes if lifestyle changes are not implemented.

## How does magnesium intake affect sleep?

Magnesium Deficiency and its Effects:

* **Magnesium controls sodium:** Magnesium helps regulate sodium levels in the body.
* **Sodium deficiency & cortisol:** Low sodium can trigger an increase in cortisol (stress hormone), affecting sleep and overall adrenal health.
* **Salt for sleep:** Consuming a bit more salt, particularly sea salt, in the evening can help regulate cortisol, promoting better sleep.
* **Healthy salt intake:** Choose whole foods like tomatoes with a sprinkle of salt, or even just a small amount of sea salt with water, rather than processed snacks high in unhealthy sodium.

**Key takeaway:** Magnesium deficiency can indirectly affect cortisol levels by impacting sodium regulation. Adequate salt intake, especially in the evening, can help improve sleep and adrenal function. However, it's important to focus on healthy sources of salt and avoid processed foods.

***

## How does niacin help with xantomas?

Niacin can help with xanthomas by addressing underlying cholesterol issues. Here are the key points:

* **Cholesterol Management**: Niacin is one of the most effective nutrients for raising HDL (good) cholesterol levels and lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol. This can help reduce the cholesterol buildup that leads to xanthomas.
* **Liver Health**: Niacin has been shown to reduce inflammation and prevent fat buildup in the liver, which can contribute to better overall cholesterol management.
* **Dosage Recommendation**: To help lower cholesterol levels effectively, 500 milligrams of extended-release niacin two to three times daily may help.

Always consult with your medical healthcare provider before starting any new supplement or protocol to address a medical condition.

## How does prolonged high blood sugar impact nerve health?

Suffering from sustained high blood sugar can cause damage to your motor or sensory nerves. The condition is called peripheral neuropathy. You can also have problems with the autonomic nerves and even the nerves to the eye. High blood sugar can also affect the blood vessels that innervate your nerves.

Taking more B-vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast supports the myelin sheath around the nerves. In addition, switching to a low carb diet like Healthy Keto® can be helpful in negating the side-effects of high blood sugar on the nerves.

## How does stress affect digestion?

How stress affects digestion:

• It causes the development of biofilms allowing harmful bacteria to survive

• It erodes the mucosa layer, which can lead to ulcers

• It decreases transit time (causes constipation)

• It can lead to leaky gut

• It alters your microbiome and decreases the diversity and number of your microbes, which can lead to inflammation and other health concerns

## How does stress impact the function and composition of white blood cells?

**Stress, primarily regulated by cortisol, plays a critical role in immune function:**

**1. Cortisol's Role:** Cortisol suppresses white blood cells, key components of the immune system, under stress conditions.

**2. Types of Stress:** Acute stress is short-term, while chronic stress, which elevates cortisol levels persistently, can lead to cortisol resistance akin to insulin resistance.

**3. Implications of Chronic Stress:** Elevated cortisol levels can impair immune response, potentially increasing susceptibility to illness and health complications.

**4. Factors Influencing Immunity:** Chronic stress, combined with nutrient deficiencies or other factors, can compromise immune function, making individuals more vulnerable to infections and health issues.

**5. Viral Impact:** Viral infections can further impact immune function by inducing nutrient deficiencies or hindering vitamin D absorption, which may exacerbate health challenges.

## How effective are prescription sleep medications in treating sleep disorders?

If you're having trouble sleeping, it's important to pinpoint the root cause of your sleep problems. If you only address the symptom, you will have to keep dealing with the symptom because you're not fixing the root cause.

**Popular sleeping aids that do not work:**

• Drinking alcohol at night

• Over the counter allergy medication

• CBD oil

• Prescription sleep medications

• Sleep trackers

• Taking melatonin

## How is magnesium deficiency treated?

Magnesium deficiency treatment typically involves magnesium supplementation, dietary changes to include magnesium-rich foods, and addressing potential underlying medical conditions that may contribute to low magnesium levels.

***

## How lack of sleep affects your health?

If you’re consistently getting less than 6 hours of sleep, you increase your risk of premature death, cancer, diabetes, dementia, and more!

Sleep is the best way to clean the brain of damaged proteins, but this only occurs when you get real sleep. Sleep medication can sedate you but will not enhance your sleep quality. Alcohol significantly decreases sleep quality, causing snoring, sleep apnea, and tossing and turning. Sleep is essential for repairing and restoring the entire body, especially the immune system. Without sleep, the immune system shuts down, leaving you vulnerable to infection.

REM sleep supports parts of the brain involved in creativity, memory, and problem-solving. It improves social interaction, emotional stability, empathy, and your mood throughout the day. Most repair occurs during non-REM sleep, also known as deep or delta-wave sleep. As you age, non-REM delta wave sleep decreases significantly. Delta wave sleep is vital for fat burning, cell repair, and cell regeneration. It’s also when your body fights infections most effectively.

To improve your sleep quality, try the following restful sleep tips:

•Avoid alcohol

•Drink kombucha tea

•Exercise regularly

•Avoid eating too late

•Avoid eating too much protein

•Sleep in a cool, dark room

•Avoid too much caffeine

•Avoid excessive blue light

•Turn lights off a few hours before bed

•Get plenty of sun during the day

•Go to bed when you’re tired

•Avoid stimulating shows/movies before bed

Magnesium, vitamin D, and zinc are the most important nutrients for sleep. L. reuteri is a microbe that can help boost oxytocin and serotonin and improve sleep. Sodium is also vital for restful sleep

## How Late-Night Snacks Affect Morning Appetite?

Eating close to bedtime can disrupt your body's natural circadian rhythms and affect blood sugar levels throughout the night. When you consume food late at night, especially carbohydrate-rich snacks, your body releases insulin to process the glucose.

However, as you sleep, your body's insulin sensitivity decreases, which can lead to higher blood sugar levels.

As the night progresses, your blood sugar levels may drop, triggering a rebound effect in the morning. This can make you wake up hungrier than usual, even if you ate a substantial amount the night before.

To avoid this cycle, it's best to avoid eating large meals or snacks close to bedtime and instead focus on balanced, nutrient-dense foods throughout the day.

## How much alcohol does it take to dehydrate you?

How much alcohol it takes to dehydrate you depends on factors such as your gender, body composition, and overall health status. It’s generally believed that for every gram of alcohol consumed, the kidneys produce around ten milliliters of urine, which increases fluid loss and contributes to dehydration.

***

## How much alcohol would it take to cause early-stage liver disease?

In a study, it was found that 21 episodes of binge drinking—defined as consuming five or more drinks per occasion—showed signs of early liver disease. This amount of alcohol corresponds to slightly more than half an ounce of pure alcohol per drink, equivalent to a standard beer, glass of wine, or shot of liquor. Consistently engaging in this level of binge drinking can begin to cause early liver damage.

## How much waste do we have in our bodies?

**The Myth of 20 Pounds of Toxic Poop**

Have you ever heard that we're all walking around with pounds of toxic waste stuck in our colons? Let's bust this myth!

While some buildup is possible, especially if you're constipated, it's highly unlikely anyone has 10-20 pounds of toxic gunk lurking inside. Not only that, but our bodies have a natural waste-removal system, and harsh cleanses can actually strip away the good bacteria we need for digestion.

**What to Focus On Instead**

If you're experiencing constipation, here's what really helps:

* **Probiotics:** Boost your gut's friendly bacteria with fermented foods or a quality supplement.
* **Fiber:** Get your fill from vegetables, not processed junk.
* **Herbal Support:** Gentle herbal laxatives can be helpful short-term.
* **The Big Picture:** Long-term digestive health comes down to your diet.

**Bottom Line:** Ditch the fear-mongering about toxic waste and focus on nourishing your gut with real food and beneficial bacteria!

## How should I address vertigo?

While Vitamin D and Magnesium play significant roles in calcium regulation, there are additional things you can do. Incorporating a proper diet, along with specific lifestyle changes, might help reduce your risk. Let’s explore these further:

#### **1. Hydration: Strike a Balance**

Dehydration can often mimic the sensations of vertigo, making proper hydration crucial for managing the condition. But there's a catch – simply increasing your water intake might not always be the solution.

As odd as it sounds, just like dehydration, excessive water consumption can also disrupt your body's electrolyte balance, potentially making vertigo worse.

Instead, aim for a healthy balance and consider incorporating electrolyte-rich drinks. These drinks can be especially helpful if you're experiencing BPPV symptoms. They are especially useful during a fast.

#### **2. Reduce Caffeine and Alcohol Intake**

Both caffeine and alcohol are known diuretics. This means they can actually exacerbate dehydration by increasing fluid loss, potentially worsening vertigo. So, it’s best to enjoy these beverages in moderation.

Consider limiting their consumption, especially if you're prone to frequent vertigo episodes. Too much caffeine or alcohol can make you go to the bathroom more, which can lead to dehydration.

#### **3. Manage Stress Effectively**

We know that stress negatively affects overall health, but you may be surprised to learn that stress can also worsen vertigo symptoms. The symptoms of BPPV can be triggered by certain head positions, and stress can make these symptoms worse.

Engage in stress-reducing activities such as deep breathing exercises. Experiment with what works best for you to keep your stress in check. Managing stress can help you find relief from your vertigo.

#### **4. Address Food Sensitivities**

Sometimes, underlying food sensitivities might trigger inflammation and worsen your vertigo. Common culprits include dairy, gluten, and processed foods. If you find you have these issues, trying an elimination diet can help identify any potential triggers.

Once you pinpoint them, eliminating or reducing their consumption might bring you some relief. If you have BPPV, your healthcare provider may recommend certain dietary changes, which could include avoiding certain trigger foods.

## How to alleviate acidosis symptoms?

While apple cider vinegar and kombucha can offer various health benefits, consuming too much acidic substance can lead to [acidosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/symptoms-of-acidosis-and-what-causes-it). Acidosis occurs when the body's pH levels become too acidic, which can cause multiple symptoms and health problems.

#### **Recognizing Symptoms**

It's essential to be aware of the signs and symptoms of acidosis, especially if you regularly consume acidic foods and drinks like apple cider vinegar and kombucha. Some common symptoms of acidosis include:

* Fatigue and weakness
* Headaches
* Rapid breathing
* Confusion
* Decreased oxygen levels
* Difficulty breathing

If you experience these symptoms after consuming apple cider vinegar or kombucha, it's important to stop consuming these drinks and seek medical attention if the symptoms persist or worsen.

To help alleviate the symptoms of acidosis, [you can try consuming alkalizing minerals](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-alkalizing-your-entire-body-is-dangerous) such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium. These minerals can help balance the body's pH levels and reduce the acidity in your system.

Alternatively, consuming a small amount of baking soda mixed with water can also help neutralize excess acid in the body.

***

## How to balance fat intake for optimum digestive capacity?

#### Balancing fat intake on a ketogenic diet is crucial to avoid overwhelming your digestive system and potential issues like keto rash. Start by gradually increasing fat intake to allow your body to adapt and produce sufficient bile for digestion. Consider using medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are easier to digest compared to other fats. These strategies help support digestive health while maximizing the benefits of a ketogenic diet.

***

## How to battle heartburn correctly?

To effectively manage heartburn, it's essential to address the underlying cause rather than rely solely on temporary solutions like antacids, which may exacerbate the issue by further reducing stomach acid and increasing susceptibility to infections, particularly H. pylori. Research suggests that an imbalance in stomach acid, rather than excess, often contributes to symptoms. Zinc carnosine has been shown to support healthy acid levels, protect the stomach lining, and combat H. pylori. A recommended dosage is 75 mg of zinc carnosine twice daily for ulcer relief. However, consult a healthcare professional before making any changes to your health regimen.

## How to be calm?

### **Understanding the Role of Neurotransmitters in Calmness**

Ever wonder why some people seem to stay calm as a cucumber no matter what life throws at them? The secret lies in their brain chemistry - specifically, a GABA neurotransmitter.

GABA is like the brain's natural chill pill. When it's flowing freely, anxiety melts away, and a sense of tranquility takes over. But when GABA levels drop, that's when anxiety can rear its ugly head.

#### **The Science Behind GABA and Calmness**

GABA acts like the brain's chill pill, dialing down activity to keep things nice and calm. It's like the bouncer at a nightclub, deciding which thoughts and feelings get to party in your head.

Research shows that people with low GABA levels are more prone to anxiety and panic disorders. Conversely, boosting GABA can lead to feelings of relaxation and well-being.

![Different alcoholic drinks](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/different-alcohol-drinks-on-table-bar.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **The Impact of Alcohol on GABA Levels**

Ever wonder why a glass of wine can make you feel so good? Alcohol increases GABA levels in the brain, leading to that initial buzz of happiness and relaxation.

But here's the catch: when the alcohol wears off, GABA levels plummet, leaving you feeling anxious and on edge. That's why [regular heavy drinking can worsen anxiety in the long run.](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-much-alcohol-do-people-really-drink)

## How to do a DIY allergy test?

This is primarily for food allergies that you can't quite determine.

During an allergic reaction, your pulse increases. A pulse oximeter is a great tool to help you check your pulse easily, but you can also check your pulse using your wrist or carotid artery.

How to do a DIY allergy test:

1\. Check and record your pulse rate:

• In the morning, before getting out of bed

• Before eating

• 30 minutes after eating

• 30 minutes after that

• 30 minutes after that

• Before bed

2\. Record what you ate next to your pulse rate

Typically, you could have an allergy if there is a difference between the low and high pulse rates above 16 points. The pulse rate also needs to be above 84. If you react to a meal, use this test over a few days, eliminating foods one at a time to help you isolate which ingredient is causing a problem.

## How to increase oxygen levels in the body?

Deep breathing alone doesn't significantly raise blood oxygen levels. Hyperventilation from over-breathing can decrease essential carbon dioxide (CO2), impairing oxygen delivery. Your body needs CO2 for efficient oxygen release to tissues, according to the Bohr effect. Excess oxygen can be harmful, causing issues like seizures or oxidation. Techniques like slow, diaphragmatic breathing and nasal breathing can optimize oxygen uptake without the risks of hyperventilation. Consult a medical professional for chronic symptoms.

## How to lower blood pressure simply by cutting out sugar?

High blood pressure can significantly affect your health, but understanding its causes and adopting natural solutions can help you manage it effectively.

One major contributor to high blood pressure is sugar. Unlike the common belief that salt is the primary culprit, sugar often plays a more significant role. When you consume sugary foods, your body releases more insulin to manage the spike in blood sugar. This, in turn, activates your sympathetic nervous system, the "fight or flight" response, leading to elevated blood pressure.

Recognizing the symptoms of sympathetic dominance, such as a lump in the throat, cold extremities, rapid heartbeat, anxiety, insomnia, and panic attacks, is crucial for early identification of high blood pressure. By paying attention to these signs, you can take proactive measures to manage your blood pressure naturally.

Cutting out sugar from your diet is a powerful step towards lowering blood pressure. It reduces insulin spikes, prevents unnecessary stress on your cardiovascular system, and improves overall health by aiding weight management, reducing inflammation, and enhancing mental clarity.

The ketogenic diet is another effective tool for blood pressure regulation. By lowering carb intake and increasing healthy fats, it reduces insulin levels and activates the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation and lowering inflammation. Fatty fish, eggs, nuts, seeds, oils like olive oil and coconut oil, and leafy green vegetables are all excellent choices for a keto diet.

In addition to dietary changes, incorporating natural remedies like vitamin D and potassium-rich foods can further support healthy blood pressure levels. Vitamin D, obtained through sunlight, supplements, or specific foods, is crucial for maintaining balanced blood pressure. Potassium-rich foods like bananas, avocados, and dairy products can also help regulate blood pressure.

Remember, a healthy lifestyle encompassing dietary changes, exercise, stress management, and sufficient sleep is key to naturally managing high blood pressure. Consult with your doctor before making any significant changes to your diet or lifestyle, especially if you have underlying health conditions.

By understanding the impact of sugar and insulin on your body and adopting natural solutions like a keto diet, vitamin D, potassium-rich foods, and lifestyle modifications, you can take charge of your health and effectively manage your blood pressure.

## How to prevent dental plaque formation?

**Dental plaque is a biofilm of microbes. A biofilm is a calcium shell built to protect a group of microbes. Plaque is one of the primary causes of gingivitis, bad breath, and tooth decay. You can brush and floss regularly and still get plaque!**

Your mouth contains the second-largest group of microbes in your body. The majority of these microbes are known as commensal, so they’re not necessarily friendly but also not unfriendly. If you kill them, you could end up with a candida infection or oral thrush. Plaque develops when this friendly relationship turns into a pathogenic relationship. Dental plaque biofilms can develop under stress! Poor diet, sugar consumption, smoking, alcohol, and antibiotics can also contribute to dental plaque formation.

Certain chemicals can mimic antibiotics in the mouth. Ironically, chlorhexidine, the main chemical in mouthwash, mimics antibiotics in the mouth. It also increases acidity and the risk of tooth decay. Fluoride is in the majority of toothpastes and our water supply. It’s been around for 60 years, but there have never been any randomized controlled trials on fluoride in our water. Fluoride is not controlled by the FDA, CDC, EPA, or the American Dental Association—it's controlled by a private entity. It’s best to filter your water to remove fluoride.

You’ll want to get the good microbes back into your mouth to remove dental plaque. Consume probiotic-rich foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, and kefir. If you chew gum, make sure to choose xylitol gum.

## How to recognize inflammation in the eyes?

### **Recognizing Inflammation and Dryness in Eyes**

This inflammation can manifest as redness, irritation, and a gritty sensation, often accompanied by excessive dryness.

[Chronic inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-10-root-causes-of-inflammation) and [dry eyes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-causes-dry-eyes) can stem from nutrient deficiencies, particularly in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, common among individuals with poorly managed blood sugar.

Addressing these deficiencies through diet and supplementation may help alleviate symptoms and support overall eye health.

### **Lifestyle Changes to Protect Your Eyesight**

In addition to dietary modifications, specific lifestyle changes can go a long way toward safeguarding eye health and managing blood sugar levels.

Implementing these strategies can help you take control of your vision and reduce the risk of severe complications down the road.

#### **Diet Adjustments for Stable Blood Sugar**

Adopting a diet that promotes stable blood sugar levels is one of the most impactful changes you can make for your eye health and overall well-being.

This typically involves reducing your intake of simple carbohydrates and sugary foods while increasing your consumption of fiber-rich vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.

Focusing on nutrient-dense, low-glycemic foods can help keep your blood sugar levels in check and minimize the damaging effects of high glucose on your eyes.

## How to Reshape Your Face

**High Cortisol and Moon Face: Understanding the Connection**

One of the most noticeable signs of Cushing's syndrome, a condition caused by elevated cortisol levels, is a "moon face." This facial fullness is due to fat redistribution triggered by chronically high cortisol. The medication Prednisone can also cause a similar effect.

**Cortisol's Impact on Your Body**

Cortisol not only shifts fat to your face and midsection, creating a hump on your back and red cheeks, but it also weakens your muscles and thins your legs. Internally, it can raise your cholesterol and lipids, disrupt your sodium and potassium balance, elevate your blood pressure, and compromise your immune system.

**The Insulin Connection**

High cortisol indirectly contributes to facial puffiness by converting protein into glucose. This elevates insulin levels, promoting fat storage and making fat loss more difficult. Factors like carb intake, frequent eating, certain oils, nutrient deficiencies, stress, overexercising, and medications can also trigger insulin.

**5 Strategies for a Leaner Face**

1. **Reduce Meal Frequency:** Implement intermittent fasting and avoid snacking to encourage your body to burn stored fat for energy.
2. **Dietary Changes:** Cut down on carbohydrates, especially sugar and starch. Refer to my card cutout for a list of ingredients to avoid.
3. **Boost Protein Intake:** Include high-quality, grass-fed meat like beef, lamb, or goat in your diet.
4. **Manage Stress:** Engage in activities that promote relaxation and well-being, such as walking, exercise, and physical work. Reduce time spent on your phone.
5.  **Prioritize Sleep:** Ensure you're getting adequate sleep. If possible, even try to go back to sleep if you wake up early.

## How to soften dry and wrinkled skin?

Most moisturizers contain alcohol, which dries and dehydrates your skin. Your moisturizer also gets absorbed into your skin, then into your bloodstream and liver. There are many natural dry skin remedies that can help, such as vitamin E, coconut oil, and tallow, but the best remedy for dry skin is hyaluronic acid.

Many of your cells make hyaluronic acid, which is also found in your skin and joints. Hyaluronic acid holds 1000 times its weight in water and can keep your skin looking youthful. It’s intimately involved in wound repair and can repair skin after a sunburn. As we age, our hyaluronic acid decreases. There are also health conditions like progeria that cause you to lose hyaluronic acid.

Hyaluronic acid can be injected, used topically, or taken orally. When taken orally, 2.5% of hyaluronic acid is absorbed, which can be enough to replace what you lose as you age. To get rid of dry, wrinkled hands and skin, take 200 mg of hyaluronic acid daily. You can also use it topically. Look for hyaluronic acid without alcohol, wet your hands, and apply a couple of drops. Rub your hands together to apply. You can also do this to your face. Also, focus on internal health to get rid of dry skin. Try Healthy Keto® to keep your skin looking healthy.

## I have not changed my meals or routine but my niacin flush has been different every day - why?

Variability in the body’s response to niacin is common, and it often has more to do with internal or environmental factors than with the supplement itself.

Even though the meal may have been the same each day, digestion can vary. Things like gut motility, enzyme activity, stomach acid, and even the microbiome can change day to day, which can affect how quickly or strongly niacin is absorbed and processed. Stress, hydration levels, hormone fluctuations, how well someone slept, or what else is happening in the body at the time can impact how niacin affects someone. Niacin sensitivity can build over several days of use, making flushes more or less intense or over time, even if the usage stays the same.

Other factors can also impact niacin response. Taking niacin after a hot shower, during a menstrual cycle shift (if applicable), or on a day when the body is already under some sort of inflammatory load can all amplify its effects.

If the customer feels uneasy about the inconsistent response she is having, reassure her that the manufacturer uses highly controlled processes to ensure each capsule contains the intended amount. If she is still unhappy, we do have the refund policy.

## I Will Get Attacked for This...

**The Medical Industry: Lies and Misconceptions**

Modern medicine is often heavily influenced by big pharma and big food, leading to a focus on medication and overlooking the crucial role of nutrition. Let's expose some common medical industry lies:

1. **"You don’t need a gallbladder"** - False. Your gallbladder stores bile, essential for fat digestion. Removing it can lead to digestive issues.
2. **"Statins have minimal side effects"** - False. Statins can cause serious side effects like type 2 diabetes and liver damage.
3. **"Hypertension is caused by too much salt"** - Misleading. While reducing sodium can help, focus on increasing potassium intake for healthy blood pressure.
4. **"Low amounts of vitamin D will fix a deficiency"** - False. If deficient, you'll need much more than 600-800 IU daily, likely around 10,000 IU.
5. **"Red meat causes cancer"** - False. Grass-fed red meat is a nutrient-dense, healthy food, rich in protein, B vitamins, and essential minerals.
6. **"Avoid saturated fats"** - Misleading. The real danger lies in unhealthy unsaturated fats found in seed oils and processed foods.
7. **"Your weight is causing your health issues"** - False. Weight is often a _symptom_ of underlying issues like insulin resistance.
8. **"Plant-based diets are best"** - Misleading. Many plant-based products are ultra-processed and less healthy than whole foods.
9. **"Hypoglycemia is a complication of diabetes"** - False. Hypoglycemia indicates too much insulin, but doctors often advise treating it with more sugar.

**Remember:** It's important to be informed and question conventional medical advice. Focus on a balanced, whole-food diet and prioritize your overall health.

## If I have inherited fatty liver, is it advisable to take choline alongside other supplements and food?

When considering hereditary issues related to fatty liver, various metabolic problems can contribute to fat accumulation in the liver. If you suspect this is the case, you’re on the right path, as choline is essential for liver health. A deficiency in choline can lead to the development of fatty liver, so it's beneficial that you are supplementing it. Whether you take choline with meals is a minor consideration; however, taking all vitamins with meals can enhance their absorption.

In addition to choline, there are three other important strategies to consider. First, incorporate probiotic-rich foods, such as sauerkraut, into your diet. These foods support the growth of beneficial microbes, which play a role in bile salt production. Adequate bile salts are crucial for breaking down cholesterol processed by the liver, as the primary method of cholesterol elimination is through the bile ducts. Ensuring sufficient bile salt production can greatly benefit liver function.

## Impact of Lifestyle Choices on Arterial Stiffness

While Vitamin K2 is a key player in arterial health, it's not the only factor to consider. Our lifestyle choices, from the foods we eat to the medications we take, can have a big impact on the flexibility and function of our arteries.

![Food for healthy bones, vitamin D source. sardines, beans, dried figs, almonds, cottage cheese, milk](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/food-healthy-bones-calcium-sorce.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **The Double-Edged Sword of Calcium Supplements**

[Calcium supplements](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-your-calcium-supplement-killing-you) are often touted as a way to support bone health, especially for older adults. However, taking high doses of calcium without adequate Vitamin K2 can actually do more harm than good.

Excess calcium that isn't properly directed into the bones can end up in the arteries, contributing to calcification and stiffness. In fact, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3690285) have shown that taking calcium supplements without Vitamin K2 can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

If you do take calcium supplements, make sure you're balancing them with adequate K2.

#### **Medication-Induced Risks for Arterial Health**

Certain medications can also have unintended consequences for arterial health. Warfarin, a common blood thinner, works by blocking the activity of Vitamin K1 in the liver.

However, it also inhibits Vitamin K2, which can lead to increased arterial calcification over time. If you're on Warfarin or a similar medication, talk to your doctor about monitoring your Vitamin K2 levels and considering supplementation if necessary.

#### **Diet's Role in Arterial Flexibility**

Finally, the foods we eat every day can have a big impact on the health and flexibility of our arteries. A low-carb, anti-inflammatory diet can be particularly beneficial.

By reducing inflammation in the body, a low-carb diet can help prevent arterial damage and stiffening that can lead to heart disease.

It's also important to limit omega-6 fatty acids, found in vegetable oils and processed foods, as these can promote inflammation in the arteries.

In contrast, omega-3 fatty acids from fish and fish oil supplements have anti-inflammatory properties that can help keep arteries supple and healthy.

By making smart dietary choices and being mindful of the medications we take, we can create a lifestyle that supports healthy, flexible arteries well into old age.

## Importance of Specific Supplements for Autism

#### **Importance of Specific Supplements for Autism**

[N-acetylcysteine (NAC)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-does-nac-n-acetylcysteine-work), selenium, cod liver oil, vitamin D3, methylcobalamin (a form of Vitamin B12), and methylfolate are essential to ensure proper brain functioning as they help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation—both being significant contributors to autism.

They aid in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation—two factors heavily implicated in autism.

Methylene blue is another exciting piece of this puzzle—it's been found to help fix mitochondrial dysfunction often seen with autism. [Studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6078194) its potential benefits when used alongside traditional treatments.

Incorporating these supplements into an individual's diet plan can provide much-needed support toward improved well-being.

Coenzyme Q10 has also demonstrated promise, enhancing energy production at a cellular level—an important aspect considering the connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and autism.

### **Amino Acid Abnormalities in Autism**

Abnormal amino acid profiles are common among individuals with autism. This can contribute to their neurological and behavioral symptoms.

#### **The Role of Amino Acids in Neurological Function**

Amino acids are essential for our brain's normal functioning, neurotransmitters or precursors. Imbalances may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders like autism.

An exciting example is [glutamate](https://www.drberg.com/blog/msg-vs-glutamate-whats-the-difference), an excitatory neurotransmitter whose excessive levels might cause neuronal damage and inflammation linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

#### **Tackling Amino Acid Imbalance**

Correcting these imbalances through diet and supplements could potentially help manage autistic symptoms.

[Studies suggest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23515006) that foods rich in essential amino acids, such as eggs, seafood, shellfish, and organ meats, along with certain supplements, can assist the body in balancing its production of neurotransmitters.

## In what specific clinical circumstances or medical conditions should the use of bile salts be contraindicated due to potential adverse effects?

Most people need bile salts. Usually, they’re not producing enough.

**What are bile salts?** Bile salts are made by the liver and are stored in the gallbladder. When the gallbladder stores the bile salts, it concentrates them. Bile is a super-concentrated mixture to help break down fats so you can extract fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids from your food.

We make about a quart of bile every day, and 90% of the bile is recycled. There are many benefits of bile. It is also necessary to help a person detoxify chemicals. You can take purified bile salts to help digest fats and prevent gallstones.

**When not to take bile salts:**

1\. If you have diarrhea

2\. If you have a hyperthyroid condition

3\. If you have bile malabsorption

**What to do if you’re body is making too much bile, or you have too much bile:**

• Lower the amount of fats in your diet to about 60g per day (not any lower)

## Increase of Luteinizing Hormone Causes Dementia

As we age, our bodies undergo numerous changes, some of which can significantly impact our cognitive function. One such change is the increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, which has been linked to age-related cognitive decline and [dementia](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-6-warning-signs-of-dementia).

Have you heard? Researchers are now investigating how much of an impact LH may have on developing or advancing brain disorders—yes, I’m talking about ones as serious as [Alzheimer’s](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-causes-alzheimers-disease).

By examining LH's link with cognitive slip-ups, we start seeing potential paths for treating dementia that involve turning down this hormone's volume.

#### **Understanding Luteinizing Hormone and Cognitive Decline**

Luteinizing hormone, produced by the pituitary gland, plays a crucial role in regulating the reproductive system. However, as we age, LH levels tend to increase, particularly in postmenopausal women.

This surge in LH has been associated with various aspects of cognitive decline, including neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction.

Research has shown that elevated LH levels can contribute to the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, two hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.

Additionally, LH has been found to disrupt the normal functioning of synapses, the critical junctions between nerve cells that facilitate communication and memory formation.

A study published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging revealed that patients with Alzheimer's disease had significantly higher levels of LH compared to those with normal cognitive function.

This finding suggests that LH may not only be a consequence of age-related hormonal changes but also a potential contributor to the development of dementia.

#### **Lupron's Role in Dementia Symptom Reduction**

Lupron, a drug commonly used to suppress sex hormones in the treatment of conditions like prostate cancer and endometriosis, has shown promise in reducing dementia symptoms by targeting LH levels.

Taking a closer look, Lupron could be our hero in toning down the bad vibes LH sends to our brain functions by keeping its production on the low.

In a cool study by the University of Utah team, Alzheimer's patients treated with Lupron showed impressive gains in remembering stuff and thinking clearly compared to those who just got a dummy pill.

The study, published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, suggests that suppressing LH levels may be a viable therapeutic approach for managing dementia symptoms.

While more research is needed to understand the long-term effects of Lupron on cognitive health fully, these initial findings offer hope for individuals struggling with dementia and their families.

By targeting the underlying hormonal imbalances that contribute to cognitive decline, we may be able to develop more effective and targeted therapies for this devastating condition.

## Is depression a disease?

Depression is a mental state. When someone is depressed you can’t take an x-ray to see depression or a blood test to see depression. Depression is subjective. Diseases are objective and they are diagnosed based on some medical test. Depression as an emotion is real and can be caused by many things – like vitamin D deficiency, for example. Also, a lack of sleep can cause chronic fatigue, which can mimic depression.

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## Is fat absorption possible without gallbladder?

### **Fat Absorption Without a Gallbladder**

Without a gallbladder, only 50% of fats consumed are absorbed, leading to issues with cell membranes, hormone production, and deficiencies in vitamins A, D, E, and K. This can also cause inflammation.

**Importance of Fats**

Fats provide energy, support skin and hair health, brain function, hormone production, and absorption of essential vitamins.

**Hormone Production Impact**

Poor fat absorption without a gallbladder affects cholesterol levels, leading to hormonal imbalances and symptoms like mood swings and muscle weakness.

**Gastric Emptying and Digestion**

Slower gastric emptying without a gallbladder can cause nutrient absorption issues. Consuming healthy fats aids digestion.

**Tips for Healthy Fat Intake**

\- Opt for avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish.

\- Avoid trans fats and limit saturated fats.

\- Eat fiber-rich foods like vegetables and nuts for better digestion.

• C. diff

• Irritable bowel syndrome

• Autism

• MS

• Rheumatoid arthritis

• Parkinson’s disease

• Chronic fatigue syndrome

• Acne

• Depression

Fecal microbiota transplantation may also help decrease the risk of cancer and has been found to be superior to antibiotics. Fecal transplant has been around for many years. However, if we had a better relationship with our microbes, we may not even need this therapy. The more we sterilize our environment, the more we’re going to need this therapy.

## Is fever beneficial to the body?

Fever is a natural defense mechanism that helps the body fight infections by mobilizing white blood cells and speeding up recovery. Attempting to reduce a fever immediately can prolong the illness. Natural approaches to support the body during fever include taking appropriate nutrients like calcium lactate and trace minerals, and occasionally fasting. It's important to monitor fever levels and seek medical advice if they exceed specific thresholds based on age. Additionally, factors like body temperature variations, dietary influences, sleep conditions, and smoking can affect overall body temperature regulation.

## Is hypoglycemia the opposite of diabetes?

Diabetes is hyperglycemia, hyper meaning “high” and hypo meaning “low”.

Hypoglycemia is not the opposite of hyperglycemia - it is the precursor or the thing that will turn into diabetes sooner or later. The difference between the two is that hypoglycemia is the prediabetic state while in hyperglycemia there is already an insulin resistance.

What to Do for Hypoglycemia:

• Intermittent Fasting

• Reduce Carbs

## Is it advisable for a child with diabetes to follow a low-carbohydrate diet?

Children with diabetes, including type 1, can benefit from a low-carb diet to manage their condition effectively. Here’s why:

1\. **Reduced Carbohydrate Intake**: Lowering carbohydrate intake helps stabilize blood sugar levels, reducing the need for insulin and other medications.

2\. **Managing Type 1 Diabetes**: For children with type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition, a low-carb diet can mitigate fluctuations in blood sugar and improve overall glucose control.

3\. **Medical Support**: It's essential for children with diabetes to work closely with healthcare providers to tailor dietary strategies and monitor health outcomes.

By adopting a low-carb diet, children with diabetes can potentially enhance their quality of life and minimize dependence on medication, while effectively managing their condition through dietary intervention. Always consult with a healthcare professional to ensure a safe and personalized approach.

***

## Is it advisable for those with Gilbert's syndrome to follow a ketogenic diet and fasting?

When following a ketogenic diet, it's essential to prioritize nutrient-dense, high-quality ingredients, even if you have specific health conditions. Keto primarily involves reducing carbohydrate intake, but this does not inherently guarantee the use of healthy foods. Incorporating intermittent fasting alongside a well-structured ketogenic approach can enhance overall health benefits. In fact, I find it difficult to identify any scenarios where this combination would be contraindicated, even during pregnancy or lactation. However, while keto may be beneficial, intermittent fasting might not be appropriate for all individuals in those situations.

***

## Is it advisable to avoid sun exposure entirely?

There has been an association between vitamin D insufficiency and autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and at least 17 different cancers.

Vitamin D is intimately involved in over 2,000 of our genes and vital for proper immune function. It’s virtually impossible to get enough vitamin D from your diet. Only 5% to 10% of vitamin D comes from diet, and that’s only if you eat plenty of fatty fish, organ meats, and egg yolks. Around 90% to 95% percent of your vitamin D comes from the sun. Every year, there are 5,125 deaths from sun exposure and 1,684,677 deaths from lack of sun. For every death from sun exposure, there are 329 deaths from lack of sun.

The current American Dermatology Association recommendation is to stay out of the sun and use sunblock. Yet, in the early 1900s, the sun was used to treat illnesses like tuberculosis and asthma. In 1935, 1 out of 1500 people developed melanoma. By 2014, 1 in 50 people had developed melanoma, despite the fact that people are spending significantly less time outside. This shows that the sun protects you from melanoma. In fact, 75% of all melanomas are located in areas not typically exposed to the sun.

Fifty-four percent of the sun's rays are infrared light. Infrared light protects against cancer, stimulates melatonin, and also generates ATP. Vitamin D and melatonin protect the mitochondria. Both are stimulated by exposure to the sun. Aim to get a moderate amount of sun exposure to avoid burning and support your health.

***

## Is it advisable to follow a ketogenic diet with hypoglycemia?

Low blood sugar comes from high blood sugar and the spike of insulin pushing it down – hypoglycemia is high insulin.

**Don’t we need sugar to balance it?**

• The actual cause of hypoglycemia is high insulin so adding more sugar to balance, it raises more insulin. Insulin resistance is also caused by too much insulin. When you have insulin resistance, the body is making 7x the amount of insulin that you need compared to a normal person.

**How to keep insulin normal?**

• Keep sugars low.

• Don’t do frequent meals.

• Consume Magnesium + Potassium + Vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast)

***

## Is it bad to be tired during the day?

While being tired for a day or two isn’t a cause for concern, chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health implications and increases the risk of obesity, metabolic disorders, heart disease, and inflammatory conditions.

***

## Is it ok to take testosterone?

When considering testosterone supplementation, it's crucial to understand potential side effects, including worsened sleep apnea, mood swings, acne, and increased cardiovascular risk. Other effects may include reduced fertility, blood thickening, testicular atrophy, and erectile dysfunction.

Before starting testosterone supplements, identifying the underlying causes of low testosterone is essential. Factors such as aging, insulin resistance, low zinc or protein intake, a low-fat diet, statin use, high soy consumption, and deficiencies in vitamins A or D should be addressed.

Boosting testosterone naturally involves strategies like weight training, increasing zinc and vitamin D intake, prioritizing healthy fats over carbohydrates, using DHEA supplements, improving REM sleep, managing weight through a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, and ensuring adequate protein intake. These methods support natural hormone production and overall health without the potential risks associated with exogenous testosterone.

***

## Is it possible to consume an excessive amount of omega-3 fatty acids?

Achieving a balanced intake of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids is essential for optimal health. While both are necessary, modern diets often emphasize omega-6 sources, which can contribute to inflammation if consumed excessively. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in foods like fish and flaxseed, help counteract inflammation and promote overall well-being. It's crucial to reduce intake of processed omega-6 oils and prioritize natural sources of omega-3 to maintain a healthy fatty acid balance.

***

## Is it possible to contract Lyme disease without a tick bite?

Some people who receive a Lyme diagnosis may have gone years without experience any of the signs of Lyme disease. The effects of the tick bite can be latent, which means the infection can remain dormant for years in the body until something happens and it manifests. 80% of the time there’s no rash. You may not even have any symptoms at all initially.

**Lyme disease symptoms:**

• Headache

• Stiffness

• Fatigue

• Bullseye rash or tick bite rash

**Natural remedies for Lyme disease:**

• Garlic

• Olive Leaf Extract

• Colloidal Silver

• Thyme

• Oregano Oil

***

## Is it possible to have nutritional deficiencies from consuming low fat protein?

### **Nutritional Deficiencies from Ultra-Low Fat Protein Sources**

If you're relying on ultra-low fat protein sources like certain whey protein powders, you may be putting yourself at risk for nutritional deficiencies. These protein sources often lack important vitamins and minerals that your body needs to function properly.

#### **Insulin Response and Nutrient Absorption**

Another issue with ultra-low fat protein sources is that they can trigger an insulin response in your body. When you consume protein without enough fat, your body releases insulin to help process the protein.

Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and other health problems. Additionally, consuming protein without fat can actually hinder your body's ability to absorb certain nutrients.

Fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K require fat to be properly absorbed by your body. Without enough fat in your diet, you may not be getting the full nutritional benefits of the foods you're eating.

### **The Importance of Fatty Acids in a Proper Diet**

So, what's the solution? It's simple: make sure you're getting enough healthy fats in your diet. Fatty acids, particularly unsaturated fats found in foods like fish and nuts, are essential for overall health and well-being.

![Human brain illustration](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/human-brain-stimulation-activity-neuron-close.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **Brain Function and Nervous System Health**

Did you know that your brain is made up of about 60% fat? It's true. Fatty acids play a crucial role in brain function and nervous system health. They help to build and maintain cell membranes, support the endocrine system, and even boost immune function.

[Omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/basics-of-omega-3-fatty-acids), in particular, have been shown to have powerful brain-boosting benefits. These fatty acids are found in foods like salmon, sardines, and walnuts.

Incorporating these foods into your diet can help support healthy brain function and reduce your risk of cognitive decline.

#### **Dietary Sources of Essential Fatty Acids**

So, where can you find healthy sources of fatty acids? Here are a few examples:

* Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines
* Nuts and seeds like walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds
* Avocados
* Olive oil
* Eggs
* Full-fat dairy products like yogurt and cheese

By incorporating these foods into your diet, you can ensure that you're getting the essential fatty acids your body needs to function properly. And trust me, your brain and nervous system will thank you.

In fact, many survival manuals advise against consuming rabbit meat if it's the only food available, due to its low fat content. Instead, they recommend seeking out fattier sources of protein to ensure your body gets the nutrients it needs.

The bottom line? Don't be afraid of fat. Embrace it as an essential part of a proper, healthy diet. Your body (and your taste buds) will thank you.

***

## Is it possible to rehabilitate from stroke?

### **Innovative Stroke Rehabilitation Strategies**

In addition to traditional rehabilitation techniques, some cutting-edge strategies show promise for enhancing stroke recovery. These approaches aim to harness the brain's natural ability to adapt and rewire itself, a process known as neuroplasticity.

#### **Acute Intermittent Hypoxia for Brain Tissue Growth**

Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) is a novel therapy that involves brief, repeated exposures to low oxygen levels followed by periods of normal oxygen.

This cycle of hypoxia and reoxygenation has been shown to stimulate the release of growth factors in the brain, which can promote the formation of new neural connections.

While more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of AIH, early studies suggest that it may be a promising adjunct therapy for stroke rehabilitation, particularly when combined with traditional physical therapy exercises.

#### **Strengthening Blood Vessels with Vitamin C Complex**

Maintaining healthy blood vessels is crucial for preventing future strokes and supporting overall brain health. The whole vitamin C complex, which includes various bioflavonoids and co-factors in addition to ascorbic acid, plays a key role in blood vessel integrity.

Vitamin C helps synthesize collagen, a protein that provides structure and strength to blood vessel walls. It also acts as an antioxidant, protecting blood vessels from damage caused by free radicals.

Incorporating vitamin C-rich foods and supplements into your diet may help support healthy blood pressure levels and reduce the risk of recurrent strokes.

## Is it safe and beneficial to undergo colon cleansing?

**There are several different types of colon cleansing:**

• **Colon hydrotherapy** - This is where water goes up the rectum into the large intestine and flushes everything out. This can flush out you’re electrolytes. You may want to take electrolytes after, so you don’t become deficient. You’re also flushing out your friendly bacteria, which would need to be put back in.

**• Herbal laxatives** - Creates a purging of the material out of the colon

**• Colema** - This is a combination of an enema and a colonic. The problem is that it’s very temporary. It also flushes out your electrolytes. If you’re already deficient in electrolytes, this can cause dizziness and even affect your heart. The apple juice a person is supposed to drink while doing the colema, can also keep the blood sugars up, preventing ketosis.

Fixing your diet (doing keto) may be the best way to go. Typically, fixing the diet can fix whatever issue caused you to want to do the colon cleansing to begin with. I’m not against colon hydrotherapy as a short-term solution for constipation or other conditions. But, it should be supervised, and the electrolytes and friendly bacteria need to be put back in.

**What you can do:**

1\. Start fasting

2\. Decrease inflammation

3\. Consume phytonutrients

4\. Consume fermented vegetables

## Is juicing advisable during chemotherapy?

Well, I don't recommend juicing anything on chemo because the fasting during chemo has a really interesting effect of lessening the side effects from chemo and radiation. So it actually gives you more protection, which is pretty wild.

You actually—if you fast when you have chemo, you actually will get through a lot better. But as far as juicing in general, maybe you want to get more nutrients, then you're going to have to just do a complete greens type thing and no fruit whatsoever because that fruit is just going to feed the cancer. The greens would be good. Cruciferous green would be good, but I don't know how you feel about juicing cruciferous. It's pretty bitter. But if you did juice a daikon radish, and that's one thing I've tried once.

***

## Is menopause associated with weight gain, and what hormonal changes and lifestyle factors contribute to this phenomenon?

The ovaries make several hormones called estrogen and progesterone.

An average woman releases 400 eggs and when going through menopause, the ovaries basically stop producing eggs. Both hormones decrease but the ratio of estrogen is still much higher than progesterone leaving someone in the state of estrogen dominance.

The estrogen dominance will trigger another hormone, Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone (CRH) which is basically a hormone that communicates to the pituitary.

Cortisol is the main hormone that creates the problem.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/is-menopause-making-you-fat-drberg-on-menopause-weight-gain)

***

## Is menopause making me look masculine?

Insulin levels go up and that is what causes polycystic ovarian syndrome – by starting to convert this male hormone, androgen. During menopause, the ovaries work differently. The adrenal glands back up the ovaries and then when you get a sudden spike in cortisol (stress hormone), it can then convert into insulin. High androgen can also be a problem.

Symptoms of High Androgen Levels

• Male Pattern Baldness

• Alopecia – Patches of hair that come out in different places.

• PCOS – Acne, facial hair, hair loss, deep voice

• Infertility

• Deep Voice

• Oily Skin

• Skin Inflammation

• Increased Sex Drive

Cause of High Androgen

• Insulin Levels go up causing PCOS Reasons:

Eating a lot of sugar

The adrenal gland is backing up the ovaries.

• High Cortisol – Sudden spike in cortisol at menopause, which can then convert into insulin.

• Decreased Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) – It is the protein in the liver that helps regulate androgens, keeping them in check.

• During Menopause, the body stops releasing estrogen faster than it stops releasing androgens.

***

## Is psoriasis contagious?

No. Psoriasis is not contagious. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease. With this condition, there are certain parts of the skin that is replacing itself too fast. It may replace itself in only three days when it should be replacing itself in around 28 days. This can result in red scaly plaques on the skin.

***

## Is reducing sugar intake an effective strategy for lowering blood sugar levels?

Sugar intake increases blood pressure because it increases insulin. Insulin triggers a spike in the sympathetic nervous system, which increases stress and worsens blood pressure.

Some of the best ways to lower blood sugar include increasing your intake of vitamin D and potassium, as well as cutting sugar out of your diet.

## Is the nerve pain connected to Vitamin B6 toxicity?

Vitamin B6 is a crucial nutrient involved in numerous bodily functions, including nerve health, metabolism, and neurotransmitter synthesis. However, for some individuals, excessive or even moderate intake of Vitamin B6 can lead to a condition known as peripheral neuropathy, which manifests as nerve pain.

**Forms of Vitamin B6**

There are different forms of Vitamin B6, with the two most common in supplements being:

Pyridoxine Hydrochloride: This synthetic form of Vitamin B6 is widely used in many supplements.

Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate (P-5-P): This is the active, coenzyme form of Vitamin B6. It is considered more bioavailable, meaning the body can utilize it directly without conversion. Proponents suggest it may be less likely to cause adverse effects than pyridoxine hydrochloride, especially at higher doses, because it's already in the form the body uses.

**The Link Between Vitamin B6 and Nerve Pain**

Despite the perceived benefits of P-5-P, for some individuals, even moderate amounts of Vitamin B6, regardless of its form, may contribute to neuropathic symptoms in certain susceptible individuals. This can occur, particularly with long-term supplementation.

Individual Sensitivity: While many people can tolerate various levels of Vitamin B6 without issues, some may have a lower tolerance. In such cases, even moderate amounts might trigger or worsen nerve pain.

Symptoms: Nerve pain related to B6 toxicity often presents as tingling, numbness, burning sensations, or sharp pain, typically in the hands and feet.

**What to Do If You Experience Nerve Pain While Taking B6**

If you are experiencing nerve pain and taking supplements containing Vitamin B6, it is highly recommended to:

Consult Your Healthcare Professional: Discuss your symptoms and all the supplements you are taking with your doctor. They can help determine if there is a connection between your B6 intake and your nerve pain.

Review Supplement Labels: Pay close attention to the dosage and the form of Vitamin B6 in all your supplements, as the combined daily intake from multiple products can add up.

It's crucial to follow personalized medical guidance, as managing nerve pain and supplement use requires careful consideration of individual health circumstances.

***

## Is there a bacteria inside an acne cyst?

Acne isn't just about clogged pores - inflammation and bacteria also play a significant role in the severity of breakouts. Let's take a closer look at the science behind these two factors.

#### **Understanding Inflammation in Acne**

Inflammation is a common symptom of acne, causing redness, swelling, and sometimes pain. When a pore becomes clogged with sebum and dead skin cells, it creates an ideal environment for bacteria to thrive.

The body's immune system responds to this bacterial invasion by sending white blood cells to fight off the infection. This process leads to inflammation, making acne more noticeable and uncomfortable.

#### **The Bacterial Aspect of Acne**

The main culprit behind acne-related inflammation is a bacteria called Propionibacterium acnes, or P. acnes for short. This bacteria is naturally present on our skin but can multiply rapidly when trapped inside clogged pores.

As P. acnes grows, it produces propionic acid, which contributes to inflammation and can cause an unpleasant odor. The combination of inflammation and bacterial growth can lead to more severe forms of acne, such as nodules and cysts.

Understanding the science behind acne inflammation and bacterial growth is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies. By targeting these underlying causes, we can help reduce the severity and frequency of acne breakouts.

***

## Is there a connection between diet soda and elevated glucose levels?

I believe artificial sweeteners can have an indirect impact on health, particularly through their effects on the microbiome. Alterations in the microbiome can lead to insulin resistance and various issues related to blood sugar regulation. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that artificial sweeteners may contribute to these metabolic concerns.

***

## Is there a correlation between caffeine consumption and the onset of migraines?

**87% of Americans drink coffee, averaging 164mg of caffeine daily. Studies show two or more caffeinated beverages daily can trigger migraines, with 3-4 drinks increasing the risk by 1.5 times and five by 2 times.**

**Other migraine triggers include:**

\- Weather

\- Sleep disturbances

\- Stress

\- Low blood sugar

\- Loud noises

\- Bright lights

**Remedies for migraines:**

1\. Reduce or eliminate caffeine

2\. Take magnesium

3\. Follow a keto diet

4\. Increase sodium intake

5\. Massage the gallbladder

6\. Take sea kelp

***

## Is there a relationship between the consumption of red meat and the development of fatty liver disease?

There's typically no direct connection between consuming high-quality, grass-fed red meat and developing a fatty liver. In fact, red meat contains nutrients like choline that can support liver health. Fatty liver conditions are often more closely linked to excessive carbohydrate intake and other dietary factors. It's important to consider your overall diet and lifestyle when addressing fatty liver concerns.

***

## Is there a remedy that helps with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)?

ALS, or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventually death. While the exact cause remains unknown, certain strategies may help manage the disease:

1\. **Hormonal Support**: Supplement with melatonin and vitamin K2. Consider natural B vitamins and pregnenolone to support progesterone production.

2\. **Infrared Therapy**: This therapy may increase melatonin levels.

3\. **Resveratrol**: Helps decrease toxicity in the body.

These approaches, while not a cure, may provide some relief and support for individuals with ALS.

***

## Is there such thing as Vitamin D toxicity?

**Understanding Vitamin D, Magnesium, and K2**

Taking high doses of vitamin D3 can sometimes lead to symptoms that may initially be mistaken for vitamin D toxicity. However, it's often a case of magnesium or vitamin K2 deficiency.

**Magnesium's Importance**

Magnesium is essential for many bodily functions, and deficiency is common. If you are taking vitamin D without enough magnesium, you may experience symptoms like:

* Irritability
* Insomnia
* Constipation
* Fatigue
* Muscle spasms/cramps
* Calcium buildup
* Arrhythmia

**The K2 Connection**

Vitamin K2 is crucial for preventing excess calcium buildup in soft tissues. Since Vitamin D significantly increases calcium absorption, having sufficient vitamin K2 is important. Some symptoms of vitamin D toxicity may actually be signs of vitamin K depletion.

**Cautions and Considerations**

While case studies of vitamin D toxicity exist, consider that these often involve subjects lacking sufficient magnesium or K2, or using vitamin D2 instead of D3.

It's best to avoid additional calcium supplements when concerned about vitamin D toxicity, as excess calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) is a key symptom.

**Therapeutic Benefits**

Vitamin D offers therapeutic potential for many health conditions. While the Mayo Clinic recommends 600 IU, brief sun exposure provides significantly more. For conditions like autoimmunity, therapeutic doses can be beneficial – as in Dr. Coimbra's protocol involving up to 200,000 IU.

**Supplementation Strategy**

If taking vitamin D supplements, always ensure you're also getting sufficient magnesium and vitamin K2. Adequate intake of boron, zinc, and vitamin A is also important.

**Disclaimer: Please consult your doctor before making significant changes to your vitamin and mineral intake.**

## Is water the most effective beverage for hydration?

While water is one of the best drinks for hydration, drinking plain water without electrolytes can worsen dehydration. Electrolytes facilitate the absorption of fluids into the body, and drinking water with a sugar-free electrolyte powder high in potassium is an excellent strategy to support fluid balance and promote optimal hydration.

## Link Between Diet and Neurological Disorders

### **Link Between Diet and Neurological Disorders**

Diet can have a profound impact on neurological health. Diet has a noticeable impact on neurological conditions, particularly [Alzheimer's](https://www.drberg.com/blog/alzheimers-simplified) and [dementia](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-6-warning-signs-of-dementia).

#### **Alzheimer's Disease, Insulin Resistance, and Glucose Starvation**

The brain relies heavily on glucose for energy. However, when insulin resistance occurs due to poor dietary choices like consuming excessive sugar or refined carbs, it can lead to what we call 'glucose starvation' in the nerves.

This starvation scenario, where neurons are deprived of essential fuel, has been linked directly with Alzheimer's disease. So you see how your dinner plate might be affecting your cognitive health.

#### **The Connection Between Gluten and Dementia**

Gluten isn't just about avoiding bread for those wanting to lose weight. It may seem harmless, but gluten sensitivity could potentially trigger gut problems that affect more than just digestion.

Studies suggest a correlation between these gluten-triggered gut issues and an increased risk of dementia - surprising, right? While research is ongoing, reducing gluten intake seems sensible for your belly and possibly for protecting against neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia.

### **Wild-Caught Salmon: A Superfood for the Brain**

For optimal brain health, wild-caught salmon should be the food of choice. But why is it considered so beneficial?

![Wild pacific salmon](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/atlantic-salmon.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **Nutrient Profile of Wild-Caught Salmon**

The secret lies in its rich nutrient profile. Packed with Omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA and EPA, salmon provides essential building blocks for neurotransmitters - those vital messengers in our brain.

These Omega-3s improve memory, learning capacity, and mood and help lower inflammation and insulin resistance, which are detrimental to our cognitive functions.

Besides these benefits, another advantage of incorporating wild-caught salmon into your diet is its keto-friendly. This means it can provide [ketones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-a-ketone) as an alternative fuel source for the brain when you're on a [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/categories/ketogenic-diet) or[practicing intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/categories/intermittent-fasting).

Last but certainly not least is astaxanthin – this pink pigment found abundantly in wild-caught salmon is a powerful antioxidant that shields neurons from damage by free radicals.

## Magnesium Deficiency and the Correlation of Heart Issues

Evidence suggests that heart attacks are more likely to occur in the morning compared to other parts of the day.

This aligns with the concept of magnesium's role in regulating calcium balance within the body and the natural fluctuation of magnesium levels, which tend to be lowest in the morning.

Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker, helping to maintain proper calcium levels within cells and preventing excessive calcium influx. When magnesium levels are low, particularly in the morning, calcium can build up inside cells, including the smooth muscle cells lining the arteries. This excess calcium can trigger:

1. **Vasoconstriction:** Calcium causes blood vessels to constrict, reducing blood flow to the heart and increasing the risk of a heart attack.
2. **Plaque Rupture:** Calcium can also contribute to the formation and destabilization of plaque within the arteries. When plaque ruptures, it can trigger blood clot formation, leading to a blockage of blood flow to the heart and a subsequent heart attack.
3. **Arrhythmias:** Calcium plays a role in regulating heart rhythm. An imbalance in calcium levels can increase the risk of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), which can also precipitate a heart attack.

It is essential to consult your healthcare professional about the prevention or causes of heart attacks or heart-related issues.

***

## Magnesium Deficiency and the Correlation of Morning Stokes

There's evidence to suggest a correlation between magnesium deficiency and an increased risk of blood clots, which can lead to strokes, particularly in the morning.

Here's how:

* **Platelet Aggregation:** Magnesium plays a key role in inhibiting platelet aggregation, the process by which platelets clump together to form blood clots. When magnesium levels are low, platelets become more prone to aggregation, increasing the risk of clot formation.
* **Calcium Regulation:** Magnesium helps regulate calcium levels, which are crucial for blood clotting. Low magnesium levels can lead to calcium buildup in blood vessels, promoting clot formation and potentially triggering a stroke.
* **Inflammation:** Magnesium has anti-inflammatory properties. A deficiency can lead to increased inflammation, which can contribute to atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arteries) and increase the risk of clot formation and stroke.
* **Circadian Rhythm:** Magnesium levels naturally dip in the morning. This coincides with the time when strokes are more frequent. The combination of low magnesium and other factors in the morning may create a perfect storm for blood clot formation and stroke.

Discussing stroke prevention and post-stroke care with your healthcare professional is crucial for maintaining your health and well-being.

***

## Magnesium Deficiency and the Correlation of Strokes in the Morning

Research suggests a potential correlation between magnesium deficiency and an increased risk of strokes, particularly in the morning. The connection is likely multifactorial and related to magnesium's crucial roles in various bodily processes.

1. **Blood Pressure Regulation:** Magnesium helps relax blood vessels and maintain healthy blood pressure. Low magnesium levels can contribute to hypertension, a major risk factor for stroke.
2. **Calcium Regulation:** Magnesium plays a vital role in regulating calcium levels. In magnesium deficiency, calcium can build up in cells, including those lining blood vessels. This can lead to vasoconstriction, plaque formation, and blood clot formation, increasing the risk of stroke.
3. **Platelet Aggregation:** Magnesium inhibits platelet aggregation, which is the clumping together of platelets that can form blood clots. Low magnesium levels may increase platelet aggregation and contribute to clot formation, potentially leading to a stroke.
4. **Inflammation:** Magnesium has anti-inflammatory properties. A deficiency may lead to increased inflammation, which is associated with atherosclerosis and an increased risk of stroke.
5. **Circadian Rhythm:** Magnesium levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day, being lowest in the morning. This coincides with the time when strokes are most likely to occur.

Discussing stroke prevention and post-stroke care with your healthcare professional is crucial for maintaining your health and well-being.

## Niacinamide and ADD/ADHD

**Important Note:** Before discussing supplements with anyone, especially children, _always_ consult with a doctor.

**Niacinamide and ADD/ADHD: Some Background**

* Dr. William Kaufman, M.D. conducted research suggesting high doses of niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3) could potentially be helpful for individuals with ADD or ADHD.
* Vitamin B3 plays a role in creating NAD, a molecule that assists cells with energy production. This may provide more energy to nerve cells, potentially easing hyperactivity and improving focus.
* A well-functioning nervous system is important. Nutrient deficiencies can sometimes affect brain and nervous system activity. Niacinamide's effects may help reduce symptoms of ADD/ADHD.
* Because niacinamide is water-soluble, it doesn't build up in the body. Some sources suggest taking approximately 250mg, 6-8 times a day may be beneficial.

**Important Considerations**

* **Consult with a doctor:** Never change medication routines or dosages without consulting a medical professional.
* **Supplements are not a substitute for healthy eating:** While niacinamide may be helpful, a balanced diet is crucial for managing ADD/ADHD.

**Disclaimer:** This information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

## Nutritional Deficiencies Leading to Depression

### **Nutritional Deficiencies Leading to Depression**

Depression can be more than a mere emotional; it may also have physical health connections. In many cases, it's also closely linked to our physical health. One overlooked factor that can cause depression is nutritional deficiencies.

Vital nutrients like vitamin B12, iron, and [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-3-fatty-acids-reduce-insulin-resistance) are crucial in maintaining brain health and mood stability. A deficiency in any of these essential elements could trigger depressive symptoms.

Studies have found that people with low levels of vitamin B12 are twice as likely to be severely depressed compared to those with normal levels.

Remember: This doesn't mean popping pills will fix your mood overnight. The body needs a nutritious diet for optimal functioning; relying solely on supplements won't cut it.

## PFAS, or per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances

PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of man-made chemicals that have earned the nickname "forever chemicals" due to their extreme persistence in the environment and our bodies. They've been linked to a range of serious health issues, including:

* **Cancer**
* **Hormone disruption**
* **Liver damage**
* **Reproductive problems**

**Where are PFAS found?**

These chemicals are surprisingly pervasive, found in:

* **Everyday products:** Teflon cookware, food packaging, canned goods, stain-resistant fabrics, firefighting foam
* **Our environment:** Drinking water, soil, air
* **Our bodies:** Fat cells, breast milk

**How to Minimize Your Exposure and Support Detoxification**

While it's impossible to completely avoid PFAS, you can take steps to limit your exposure and support your body's natural detoxification processes:

**1. Reduce your exposure:**

* **Filter your drinking water:** Invest in a high-quality water filter certified to remove PFAS, such as those from Travel Berkey, Clearly Filtered, or Zero Water.
* **Choose PFAS-free products:** Opt for cookware, food packaging, and other products that are PFAS-free.
* **Minimize processed foods:** Processed foods often contain higher levels of PFAS.

**2. Support your body's detoxification:**

* **Boost your glutathione levels:** This crucial antioxidant helps neutralize toxins.
  * Consume foods rich in sulfur: Eggs, garlic, onions, cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts).
  * Increase your intake of glutamine: Found in red meat, glycine, and probiotics.
* **Enhance elimination:**
  * **Sweat regularly:** Through exercise or sauna use.
  * **Support autophagy:** Intermittent fasting can help promote this cellular cleaning process.
  * **Consider infrared light therapy:** May aid in detoxification.
  * **Consume spirulina and chlorella:** These algae are known for their detoxifying properties.

**3. Support your overall health:**

* **Eat a nutrient-rich diet:** Focus on whole, unprocessed foods, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein.
* **Ensure adequate intake of trace minerals:** Selenium, iodine, and copper, found in seafood and grass-fed red meat, support detoxification pathways.

While a completely toxin-free environment may be unattainable, taking proactive steps to minimize your exposure and support your body's natural defenses can help reduce the health risks associated with PFAS.

## Risks Associated with Over-Alkalization

### **Risks Associated with Over-Alkalization**

Drinking too much alkaline water can lead to a condition known as [alkalosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-alkalosis). You may experience muscle spasms and abnormal sensations when your body is overly alkaline. But it doesn't stop there.

#### **Hypochlorhydria or Achlorhydria - Consequences of Over-Alkalization**

If the stomach becomes excessively alkaline, conditions like hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria can develop. This affects protein digestion and mineral absorption negatively. Moreover, it also increases allergy risks.

In extreme cases of over-alkalization, [low potassium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/top-symptoms-of-having-low-potassium) and calcium levels in the blood might occur. You wouldn't want that.

#### **Alkalosis and Urinary Health**

The pH balance in our urine plays a crucial role in maintaining urinary health. Drinking excessive amounts of alkaline water can upset this delicate balance.

This alteration potentially heightens infection risk because an imbalance allows harmful bacteria to thrive more easily. [Studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3571898) that urinary tract infections are more common when the urine's pH is imbalanced.

## Role of Vitamins and Minerals in Autism

#### **Role of Vitamins and Minerals in Autism**

Vitamins A, E, and D, along with minerals such as [zinc](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-unexpected-amazing-benefits-of-zinc-that-you-ve-rarely-heard-about), [selenium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/12-amazing-benefits-of-selenium), and [magnesium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-benefits-of-magnesium), have pivotal roles to play in maintaining optimal brain function.

These nutrients help regulate neurotransmitters that affect mood and behavior—factors intrinsically linked to autism.

The lack thereof is frequently observed among those diagnosed with autism, leading to aggravated symptoms.

For instance, high homocysteine levels—a condition associated predominantly with vitamin B12 deficiency—can cause degenerative changes in the brain over time if left unchecked.

### **Dietary Recommendations for Individuals with Autism**

Adapting to a modified carnivore diet can help manage autism symptoms by eliminating potential allergens. It's essential, however, not to limit the food intake strictly to meat.

***

## Should people on the carnivore diet worry about ketoacidosis, elevated ammonia, or elevated urea?

Well, you're not just eating all the protein to your eating a lot of fat. Okay, so you're eating fat which actually kind of offsets that and our bodies have an incredible ability to adapt to different diets. So some people have an issue.

Some people don't but the benefits of doing that, especially if you have gut inflammation, you just pretty much you're creating a healing response to your gut because in that situation your system is compromised where you can't tolerate these fibers or legumes or or anything other than some protein and so and fat. It seems to work, but I would recommend not just doing muscle protein. I would also recommend doing like the eggs, the fish, things like that.

But it's something to test the waters and then see how you do. Do I recommend it long term? It really depends on the severity of damage. But once your gut heals, maybe you want to start introducing things like sauerkraut or fermented vegetables in smaller amounts and gradually increase it after that.

***

## Should you limit glutamine when you have cancer?

For Individuals with Cancer, Dr. Berg mentions that cancer cells can consume glutamine, suggesting that if you have cancer, you might need to consider strategies like using a glutamine inhibitor or adjusting your diet. He suggests that intermittent fasting for extended periods and reducing protein intake could be beneficial.

While glutamine is a necessary amino acid for various bodily functions, its consumption or supplementation should be carefully considered in the context of cancer. This implies that direct supplementation with glutamine might not be recommended for cancer patients without careful consideration of their overall dietary and treatment plan.

If you have cancer, **it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider before taking glutamine supplements or making significant changes to your diet, especially regarding glutamine intake**. Dr. Berg's advice highlights the complexity of glutamine's role in the body and the need for a tailored approach to nutrition and supplementation for cancer patients.

***

## The Adrenal Potassium Connection

Potassium is essential for our body's overall function, playing a vital role in quality sleep, supporting neural activities, and stabilizing blood sugar and blood pressure. A healthy adult typically requires 4,700 milligrams of potassium daily, equating to seven to ten cups of potassium-rich foods.

However, there are two exceptions where this recommended intake does not apply: Cushing's syndrome and Addison's disease.

Cushing's syndrome occurs when the adrenal gland overproduces cortisol, leading to symptoms like weight gain, fatigue, and high blood pressure. When cortisol levels eventually drop, it can result in adrenal fatigue. Adding potassium in this scenario may not be beneficial.

Addison's disease, conversely, is characterized by insufficient cortisol levels. This can cause inflammation, weight loss, pigmentation changes, and a weakened immune system. In this case, increasing potassium intake could worsen the condition. Consuming salt is a more suitable approach for individuals with Addison's.

Understanding these conditions and their relationship with potassium is crucial for maintaining optimal health. Consult your doctor for personalized advice if you have Cushing's syndrome or Addison's disease.

## The Biggest Research Study Scam

**Understanding Research Manipulation and the Importance of Critical Evaluation**

Dr. Westman, an M.D. and Master's-level statistician, highlights how data in research studies can be manipulated to present misleading information. He emphasizes the crucial distinction between absolute risk and relative risk and how this difference can be exploited.

**The Limitations of Observational Studies**

Dr. Westman points out that observational studies often cannot prove causation. He cites examples like recent headlines demonizing red meat and fasting, which frequently stem from self-reported observational studies with unreliable dietary recall data.

While observational studies cannot establish definitive cause-and-effect relationships, they serve a purpose as "hypothesis-generating studies," providing a potential starting point for more rigorous experimental research.

**Case Study: The Stanford Twin Experiment**

Dr. Westman discusses the Stanford twin experiment, a study with flaws and funding from a plant-based interest group, as a recent example of potentially misleading research.

**Nutritional Epidemiology and its Weaknesses**

Harvard University's School of Public Health conducts research based on observational studies linking dietary elements to health outcomes. Dr. Westman cautions that nutritional epidemiology often only reveals weak associations and shouldn't be treated as definitive fact.

**Dr. Westman's Approach**

Dr. Westman's clinic uses a low-carb keto diet to successfully treat numerous chronic health conditions, including diabetes, obesity, heartburn, and IBS. He focuses on both treating and educating patients, offering online courses on health topics through his Adapt Your Life Academy.

**Disclaimer: It's important to critically evaluate all health-related information and consult with qualified medical professionals when making decisions about your health.**

## The Brain's Unique Nutritional Needs

### **The Brain's Unique Nutritional Needs**

Our brains are fascinating, complex organs. Despite making up just 2% of our body weight, they use a whopping 20% of the energy we consume. But that's not all; the brain has other unique characteristics.

#### **The Brain's High Energy Consumption**

A high-performance engine needs top-quality fuel to run efficiently; your brain is no different. It consumes about one-fifth of your daily calorie intake. That's quite impressive, given its tiny size compared to the rest of your body.

This high demand for energy underscores how important it is to feed your mind with nutrient-rich foods. Doing so, you help ensure optimal performance and health for this critical organ.

#### **Brain Regeneration and Size**

Contrary to popular belief, intelligence is not determined by the size of one's brain. No correlation exists between intellect and brain size. What matters more is the complexity within our grey matter.

Fascinatingly, certain parts of our brains can regenerate, too – something once thought impossible in neuroscience. While not all areas have this capability, some regions, like the hippocampus, show promising signs of regrowth under specific conditions.

### **Harmful Foods for Brain Health**

Despite weighing only 2% of your body mass, the brain is an enormous energy consumer, devouring up to 20% of your daily caloric intake. It gobbles up to 20% of your daily calorie intake. However, not all foods are beneficial for this vital organ.

#### **The Impact of Omega-6 Fatty Acids**

[Omega-6 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-6-fats-and-inflammation) can be tricky. They're essential fats our bodies need but can't produce - so we must get them from food. Excess consumption of omega-6 fatty acids relative to [omega-3s](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-3-fatty-acids-reduce-insulin-resistance) can lead to inflammation in the brain.

Foods like vegetable oils (think soybean or corn oil) and certain nuts and seeds are high in omega-6s.

When these foods dominate our diet without adequate counterbalance from omega-rich fish or flaxseeds, it's like inviting a rowdy party-goer into your home who starts throwing furniture around—that's what inflammation does to your delicate brain cells.

#### **Sugar and Refined Carbohydrates' Role in Insulin Resistance**

Next on the 'bad guys' list are sugar and refined carbohydrates—these culprits aren't just waistline expanders but also dangerous for the mind.

[Research shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5133120) that diets high in sugar lead to [insulin resistance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/insulin-resistance-and-gluconeogenesis) over time—a condition where cells stop responding effectively to insulin signals. The result? Your neurons starve as they struggle with glucose uptake, impacting cognitive function negatively.

Frequent consumption of sodas, candy bars, pastries—even seemingly healthy foods like some breakfast cereals—can be akin to signing a 'do not disturb' sign for your brain cells. The takeaway? Be mindful of what you feed your body—it directly impacts your mind's health and function.

#### **The Link Between Sedentary Behavior and Obesity**

A detailed look at how a [lack of physical activity](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-real-benefit-of-exercise-is-not-weight-loss) can lead to weight gain and [obesity-related health issues](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-answer-to-obesity-is-obvious-if-you-look-at-the-statistics).

Inactivity can be a precursor to obesity, with numerous studies showing its effect on the rise of global rates. This link between idleness and obesity has been well-established by multiple studies.

Falling into inactive habits makes it easy for extra pounds to creep up on you, contributing more than we'd like to admit towards obesity rates worldwide.

#### **The Role of Inactivity in Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes**

Realizing the part that lack of activity plays in [insulin resistance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/insulin-resistance-and-gluconeogenesis) and the formation of [metabolic syndrome and diabetes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/metabolic-syndrome-is-really-the-hyperfat-storing-hormoneemia-syndrome).

Sedentariness doesn't just impact our waistlines but also wreaks havoc with our metabolic systems. Inactive habits contribute significantly towards insulin resistance - an unfortunate precursor to diabetes.

Metabolic syndrome, another consequence linked closely with a sedentary lifestyle, poses serious risks, as it predisposes individuals towards cardiovascular diseases and stroke, amongst other complications.

## The Importance of Reducing Inflammation for Healthy Hair

[Inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-inflammation-factor-in-common-diseases) is another factor that can contribute to hair loss, as it can damage hair follicles and disrupt the hair growth cycle. One common cause of inflammation is an imbalance of [omega-6 and omega-3](https://www.drberg.com/blog/get-your-omega-6-to-omega-3-ratios-balanced) fatty acids in the diet.

[Omega-6 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-6-fats-and-inflammation), which are found in many processed and fried foods, can promote inflammation in the body. On the other hand, [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/basics-of-omega-3-fatty-acids), which are found in fatty fish, nuts, and seeds, have anti-inflammatory properties.

To reduce inflammation and support healthy hair growth, it's important to limit your intake of omega-6-rich foods and increase your intake of omega-3s. Some good sources of omega-3s include:

* Fatty fish, such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel
* Flaxseeds and chia seeds
* Walnuts and almonds
* Avocados

By reducing inflammation in the body, you can create a more hospitable environment for healthy hair growth.

#### **Balancing Hormones Through Diet**

Hormonal imbalances can also contribute to hair loss, particularly in women. Estrogen, in particular, plays a key role in promoting healthy hair growth, while an excess of androgens like DHT can lead to hair thinning and shedding.

To help balance hormones and support healthy hair growth, it's important to include plenty of hormone-balancing foods in your diet. Some good options include:

* Cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli and cauliflower, which contain compounds that help regulate estrogen levels
* Soy products, such as tofu and tempeh, which contain phytoestrogens that can help balance hormones
* Healthy fats, such as avocados and nuts, which are important for hormone production and balance
* Adaptogenic herbs, such as ashwagandha and maca, which can help regulate the stress response and balance hormones

By incorporating these hormone-balancing foods into your diet, you can help create a more balanced hormonal environment that supports healthy hair growth.

## The Low Magnesium Epidemic

Let’s talk about the benefits of magnesium and the dangers of magnesium deficiency.

A deficiency in magnesium could put you at risk for certain health concerns, such as:

• High blood pressure

• Arrhythmias

• Tetany or twitching

• Leg or foot cramps

• Fatigue

• Diabetes

• Insulin resistance

• Depression

• Inflammation

The RDAs for magnesium are 300 to 750 mg. But some people may need much higher amounts. It’s important to consume foods high in magnesium and avoid certain things that deplete magnesium.

Foods rich in magnesium are the ones high in chlorophyll, which would be green vegetables. The top things that deplete magnesium are sugar and refined carbohydrates.

Other things that can lead to a magnesium deficiency include:

• Diarrhea

• Diuretics

• Antibiotics

• Alcohol consumption

• Age

For a magnesium supplement, you have a few different good options, including:

• Magnesium citrate

• Magnesium lactate

• Magnesium glycinate

• Magnesium aspartate

• Magnesium gluconate

Magnesium is important for the absorption of vitamin D and B vitamins. It also helps support healthy cortisol levels, which can reduce stress and help you sleep better.

## The Role of Antacids in Altering Stomach pH

### **The Role of Antacids in Altering Stomach pH**

Antacids, a common go-to for heartburn relief, can drastically change our stomach's acidity. They work by neutralizing excess acid.

Research has shown that these remedies can lead to conditions like hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria when overused. That's right - consuming too many antacids may lower your stomach acid more than necessary.

#### **Understanding Antacid Overuse**

"Too much of a good thing can be detrimental." While antacids are helpful in small doses, consistent use could create problems with protein digestion and mineral absorption due to reduced acidity.

You might think 'less acid equals less pain,' but let me surprise you: low stomach acid can increase your risk of allergies. So before reaching for an antacid next time you feel discomfort, remember moderation is key.

## The Role of Cortisol in Morning Hunger

### **The Role of Cortisol in Morning Hunger**

[Cortisol, often called the "stress hormone,"](https://www.drberg.com/blog/cortisol-extremely-simplified-by-dr-berg) plays a significant role in morning hunger while fasting and doing keto. When you wake up, cortisol levels experience a significant spike.

This spike is not just a tiny increase; it's more like a high jump athlete clearing the bar. The reason this matters is that when cortisol levels rise, it also leads to an increase in glucose (sugar) levels in the body.

This rise in blood sugar is the body's way of ensuring that you have enough energy to start your day.

However, for individuals [following a ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-start-keto-correctly) or [practicing intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/my-1-best-intermittent-fasting-tips-for-faster-weight-loss-dr-berg), this increase in blood sugar can also trigger the brain to signal hunger, even if you're not hungry.

Grasping the intricate interplay of hormones is vital for those tackling unwelcome morning cravings as they commit to their nutritional objectives.

So, the next time you feel your stomach growling before breakfast while on keto or during a fasting period, remember that cortisol may be playing a role in your morning routine.

## The Role of Liver and Adrenals in Blood Sugar Regulation

### **The Role of Liver and Adrenals in Blood Sugar Regulation**

Regarding [intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-7-important-intermittent-fasting-rules), the liver and adrenal glands play a crucial role in stabilizing blood sugar levels. These two organs work together to prevent hypoglycemic reactions, making fasting more challenging and dangerous for some people.

I've seen firsthand how important it is to maintain the health of your liver and adrenals if you want to succeed with intermittent fasting. Let's look at how these organs function and what you can do to support them.

#### **Understanding Hypoglycemia and Its Impact**

[Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-hypoglycemia-tip), can cause unpleasant symptoms like dizziness, irritability, and difficulty concentrating.

For people practicing intermittent fasting, these symptoms can be especially problematic and may even lead to fainting or seizures in severe cases.

It's essential to recognize the signs of hypoglycemia so you can take steps to prevent it from derailing your fasting efforts. Some common symptoms include:

* Shakiness or trembling
* Rapid heartbeat
* Sweating
* Confusion or difficulty focusing
* Irritability or mood swings

#### **The Interplay Between Liver Health and Blood Sugar Levels**

The liver plays a vital role in regulating blood sugar by storing excess glucose as [glycogen](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-glycogen) and releasing it into the bloodstream when levels drop too low.

However, liver damage from conditions like fatty liver disease or cirrhosis can impair this function, making it harder to maintain stable blood sugar during fasting periods.

When the liver cannot store and release glucose effectively, you may experience more frequent or severe hypoglycemic episodes. This can make intermittent fasting feel like an uphill battle, even if you do everything else right.

According to Dr. Berg, "Hypoglycemic reactions can be prevented by the adrenals and the liver." So if you're struggling with low blood sugar during fasting, it's worth taking a closer look at the health of these two key organs.

***

## The Role of Vitamin C and K in Preventing Eye Hemorrhaging

#### **The Role of Vitamin C and K in Preventing Eye Hemorrhaging**

Vitamins C and K play a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of the blood vessels in your eyes. When you don't get enough of these essential nutrients, the tiny capillaries in your eyes can become weak and prone to leaking or even hemorrhaging.

This can lead to some scary symptoms like sudden vision changes, floaters, or even blind spots. So if you notice any unexplained bleeding in your eyes, it could be a sign of a vitamin C or K deficiency that needs to be addressed ASAP.

#### **Addressing Light Sensitivity Through Nutrition**

Do you find yourself squinting or shielding your eyes from bright lights? [Vitamin B1, also known as thiamine](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-b1-thiamine-deficiency-signs-symptoms-and-treatment-benefits), could be the missing link. This essential nutrient plays a crucial role in managing light sensitivity issues.

When you're deficient in vitamin B1, your eyes may struggle to adapt to changes in lighting, leading to discomfort and even pain in bright environments.

#### **Nutritional Causes of Night Blindness**

If you have trouble seeing clearly in low-light conditions, a deficiency in vitamin A could be to blame. This vital nutrient is essential for producing rhodopsin, a pigment in the retina that helps you see in the dark.

Without enough vitamin A, your eyes may struggle to adjust to dim lighting, leading to night blindness and difficulty navigating in the dark. In rare cases, night blindness can also result from arsenic poisoning, which can interfere with vitamin A metabolism.

So if you're dealing with night vision issues, boosting your intake of vitamin A-rich foods like sweet potatoes, carrots, and leafy greens could make a big difference.

The bottom line? A proper diet rich in essential vitamins and minerals is crucial for maintaining healthy eyes and vision.

By being mindful of these common nutritional deficiencies and addressing them through diet and supplementation, you can give your eyes the support they need to function at their best for years to come.

## The Silent Threat of Diabetic Retinopathy

### **The Silent Threat of Diabetic Retinopathy**

Diabetic retinopathy is a severe complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness if not addressed promptly.

This condition occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the tiny blood vessels surrounding the nerve in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.

As these blood vessels weaken and leak fluid, it can cause swelling, bleeding, and scarring within the retina. Over time, this damage can progress to the point of irreversible vision loss, making diabetic retinopathy a leading cause of blindness among people with diabetes.

### **Nutritional Interventions for Eye Health**

While managing blood sugar levels is crucial for maintaining eye health, confident dietary choices and supplements can also support this.

Incorporating specific nutrients into your diet may help minimize the risk of eye complications associated with high blood sugar.

#### **The Role of Benfotiamine**

Benthotamine, a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1, has shown promise in minimizing complications from high sugar levels, particularly in retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy cases.

This unique form of thiamine can cross cell membranes more efficiently, allowing it to exert its protective effects within the eye tissues.

Studies have suggested that benthotamine supplementation may help reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy progression and support overall eye health in individuals with diabetes.

## The Truth About This "Healthy" Food

It's true that gluten can be problematic, but it's not the only protein humans struggle to digest. And while excessive gluten intake can contribute to gut inflammation, it's important to remember that **"gluten-free" doesn't automatically equal "healthy."**

Many processed gluten-free foods are packed with refined sugars, starches, and unhealthy seed oils, which can be just as damaging to your gut as gluten. These ingredients feed harmful bacteria, leading to imbalances that can trigger inflammation throughout the body and contribute to issues like fatty liver and skin problems.

Furthermore, the process of removing gluten from grains often involves harsh chemicals and results in a highly refined product that lacks essential nutrients. This can lead to overeating, nutrient deficiencies, and further gut imbalances like SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) and leaky gut.

Since gut health is closely linked to mental well-being, these issues can also manifest as mood swings, low energy, anxiety, and depression.

**Instead of relying on processed gluten-free products, prioritize whole foods like:**

* **Meat and poultry:** Excellent sources of protein and nutrients.
* **Vegetables:** Provide fiber and essential vitamins and minerals.
* **Healthy fats:** Avocado, olive oil, coconut oil, etc., support gut health.

**If you find that certain vegetables worsen your gut symptoms, you could explore approaches like the carnivore diet temporarily to help reduce inflammation and identify trigger foods.**

**Remember to always read ingredient labels carefully and choose whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible.**

## This 1 Thing Can Replace Our Entire Medical System

Fasting has gained significant attention for its potential to address the root cause of many chronic illnesses: insulin resistance. By abstaining from food for a period, you can effectively "reset" your body's metabolism and improve its sensitivity to insulin.

**How Fasting Works:**

* **Activates Survival Genes:** Fasting triggers survival mechanisms within your body, prompting it to utilize stored fat and ketones for energy instead of relying solely on glucose.
* **Ketosis:** It typically takes around 3 days of fasting to enter ketosis, a metabolic state where your body efficiently burns fat for fuel.
* **Insulin Sensitivity:** Fasting enhances your cells' responsiveness to insulin, allowing for better blood sugar regulation.
* **Cortisol Levels:** Contrary to popular belief, fasting does not elevate cortisol (stress hormone) levels.

**Types of Fasting:**

* **Water Fasting:** Consuming only water during the fasting period.
* **Dry Fasting:** Abstaining from both food and water. Dry fasting may offer additional benefits like accelerated weight loss and enhanced detoxification, but it should be approached with caution and under appropriate guidance.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Listen to Your Body:** Don't force yourself to fast longer than feels comfortable. Pay attention to your body's hunger cues.
* **Nutrient Intake:** If you experience hair loss or menstrual irregularities while fasting, it could indicate a lack of protein. Prioritize high-quality protein sources like grass-fed red meat, which provides essential amino acids, trace minerals, and B vitamins.
* **Essential Minerals:** Ensure adequate intake of sea salt, magnesium (around 400mg), and zinc (around 50mg) to support overall health during fasting.
* **Hydration and Sleep:** Stay well-hydrated (especially during water fasting) and prioritize getting enough sleep.

**Disclaimer:** While fasting can offer significant health benefits, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any fasting regimen, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications.

## This Can DESTROY Your Body

**The origins of viruses remain a subject of scientific debate. One theory suggests that they serve a crucial role in survival.**

**While our innate immune system is present from birth, our acquired immune system develops over time. Viruses play a vital role in this process, stimulating the immune system to adapt and strengthen.**

**Some viruses, such as Epstein-Barr, can interfere with the vitamin D receptor. Vitamin D is essential for overall health, supporting both bone health and immune function.**

**To ensure a robust immune system, it's crucial to maintain adequate vitamin D levels. Aim for a daily intake of at least 10,000 IU through food, sun exposure, or supplements.**

**Here are additional strategies to bolster your immune cells:**

* **Zinc**
* **Vitamin C**
* **Quality sleep**
* **Stress reduction**
* **Garlic**
* **Elderberry**
* **Intermittent fasting**
* **Magnesium**
*   **Laughter**

## Underlying Cause for Autism

### **Understanding Autism and Oxidative Stress**

The real root cause of autism is often overlooked. It's not just genetics or environment, but more specifically, oxidative stress impacting neurons. This neuronal toxicity leads to inflammation, which plays a significant role in autism.

#### **Role of Oxidative Stress in Autism**

When the production of free radicals outweighs our body's ability to neutralize them with antioxidants, oxidative stress occurs. In individuals with autism, this balance tends to tip towards more oxidative stress.

This excess can damage cells, proteins, and DNA. When it comes to brain cells, or neurons as we call them, this impact becomes particularly profound due to its direct link with neurodevelopmental disorders like autism.

#### **Connection between Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Autism**

Beyond the immediate toxic effects on neurons, excessive oxidative stress also causes mitochondrial dysfunction - an issue frequently seen in those with autism.

Mitochondria are the powerhouse of our cells; they produce energy needed for cellular activities.

However, under high levels of oxidative stress, these tiny powerhouses falter, leading to impaired cell function, which may further contribute to autistic behaviors.

Research shows a clear connection here, indicating that tackling oxidative stresses could be vital in managing autism better.

### **Nutritional Deficiencies in Individuals with Autism**

People with autism often grapple with nutritional deficiencies, impacting their overall health. Among these shortcomings are reduced levels of vital antioxidants, notably glutathione.

## Understanding the Antioxidant Network: Oxidative Stress & Free Radicals

A free radical is an atom with an unpaired electron and could create a lot of damage inside the body, while an antioxidant is an atom that has a paired electron, is stable and balanced and it also donates one of its electrons to make the free radical stable.

Examples of Free Radicals and Oxidants:

• Iron – In some of the enriched food

• Radiation • Sugar – Large quantities of sugar destroy the body

• Chemicals / Pollution / Smoking

• Vegetable Oils – It can act as an oxidant and create free radicals

A free radical is an atom with an unpaired electron and could create a lot of damage inside the body, while an antioxidant is an atom that has a paired electron, is stable and balanced and it also donates one of its electrons to make the free radical stable.

Antioxidants:

• Vitamin E

• Vitamin C

• Zinc – Oysters, Seafood, Lobster

• Selenium – Brazil nuts

• Vitamin B1 – Leafy Greens

• Lipoic acid – it’s fat-soluble and has the ability to penetrate into the cell and protect the cells at different locations

• Uric acid – helps clean out damage from various things

***

## Understanding the pH Scale and Its Role in Our Body

The pH scale, ranging from 0 to 14, plays a vital role in our bodies. At the opposite ends of the scale, we have 0 representing extreme acidity and 14 for total alkalinity, with 7 as neutral territory. The middle ground, neutral territory, sits comfortably at seven.

#### **The Importance of pH Balance in the Body**

A healthy body isn't all about being 'neutral.' Different parts of our system thrive under varying levels of acidity or alkalinity. It's like throwing a party - everyone has their preferred music volume; too loud or soft doesn't cut it.

Blood, for instance, slightly leans towards being more alkaline, with an optimal level between 7.35 and 7.45.

#### **The Role of Acidic Environment in the Stomach**

Your stomach prefers heavy metal over classical tunes – metaphorically speaking. With a natural pH falling between 1 and 3, it’s an acidic rock star that helps break down food into digestible pieces while also fighting off harmful pathogens.

## Unmasking Hidden Ingredients in Your Food

**Unmasking Hidden Ingredients in Your Food**

Did you know food manufacturers employ sneaky tactics to conceal what's really in your food?

* **The Rounding Rule:** If an ingredient is less than 500mg per serving, it might not even be listed! This means you could be consuming unwanted additives without even knowing it.
* **Sugar Overload:** There are over 200 different names for sugar, making it difficult to track your intake.
* **Incidental Additives:** These ingredients aren't for flavor, texture, or preservation, and if they make up less than 5% of the product, they can be hidden from the ingredient list. A common culprit is maltodextrin, a carbohydrate that acts like sugar in the body and has a higher glycemic index than table sugar.
* **Hidden Dangers:** Hexane, a neurotoxin, is used to extract soy protein isolates found in many plant-based products. Despite its dangers, there's no regulation on how much hexane can remain in your food.

**DIY Ingredient Detective:**

Want to uncover hidden starches? Add a couple of drops of iodine to a glass of water. If your food turns blue or purple when mixed in, it contains hidden starch!

It's time to become a savvy label reader and take control of what you consume.

## Use Your Feet to Diagnose Liver Problems

One common sign of liver problems is red and brown spots on the lower leg. These spots are caused by poor circulation and are often seen in people who have diabetes or cirrhosis of the liver. When the liver isn't functioning properly, you may experience bruising and discoloration.

You may also notice that the lower leg is swollen and shiny and no longer grows hair. Pitting edema may accompany these symptoms. The good news about liver problems is that the liver is one of the only organs that can completely regenerate itself!

Spider veins, whether in the lower leg and foot or anywhere else on the body, signify that the liver can no longer regulate estrogen. Excess estrogen can cause a fatty liver and problems with your bile ducts, which can lead to gallstones.

Dry, cracked heels or generally dry feet are symptoms of an omega-3 deficiency.

The liver makes bile, which helps you break down and absorb fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients. If you have liver damage, it will be difficult to absorb omega-3 fatty acids. Rarely, dry, cracked heels may be related to a B3 deficiency.

Other foot-related symptoms that typically signify liver damage include:

•Itchy feet

•Fungal infections

•Inflammatory conditions like arthritis and plantar fasciitis

•Foot odor

•Hot/cold feet

•Toenail fungus

•Fungus between toes

## Viagra as a Treatment for Erectile Dysfunction

### **Viagra as a Treatment for Erectile Dysfunction**

For those experiencing ED, Viagra is an option to consider. This famous medication works by inhibiting an enzyme known as PDE5, which is crucial in helping men achieve and maintain an erection.

#### **How Viagra Works**

The science behind how Viagra functions is fascinating. Blocking the PDE5 enzyme allows blood vessels to expand more freely. More blood can then flow into the penis during sexual stimulation, improving the ability to get an erection.

Yet, while effective for many, it's worth noting that around 30% of individuals don't find relief from their ED symptoms when using this drug alone. Therefore, alternative or additional treatments might need exploration.

#### **Potential Side Effects of Viagra**

All medications come with potential side effects - even ones like Viagra. Common complaints include headaches and flushing, but there are also rare yet serious risks such as vision loss and penile gangrene - although occurrences of these severe side effects are indeed scarce.

Remembering these statistics can help manage expectations about what this treatment option can offer.

## Vitamin B6 Sensitivity and Nerve Pain

Vitamin B6 is a crucial nutrient involved in numerous bodily functions, including nerve health, metabolism, and neurotransmitter synthesis. However, for some individuals, excessive or even moderate intake of Vitamin B6 can lead to a condition known as peripheral neuropathy, which manifests as nerve pain.

**Forms of Vitamin B6**

There are different forms of Vitamin B6, with the two most common in supplements being:

Pyridoxine Hydrochloride: This synthetic form of Vitamin B6 is widely used in many supplements.

Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate (P-5-P): This is the active, coenzyme form of Vitamin B6. It is considered more bioavailable, meaning the body can utilize it directly without conversion. Proponents suggest it may be less likely to cause adverse effects than pyridoxine hydrochloride, especially at higher doses, because it's already in the form the body uses.

**The Link Between Vitamin B6 and Nerve Pain**

Despite the perceived benefits of P-5-P, for some individuals, even moderate amounts of Vitamin B6, regardless of its form, may contribute to neuropathic symptoms in certain susceptible individuals. This can occur, particularly with long-term supplementation.

Individual Sensitivity: While many people can tolerate various levels of Vitamin B6 without issues, some may have a lower tolerance. In such cases, even moderate amounts might trigger or worsen nerve pain.

Symptoms: Nerve pain related to B6 toxicity often presents as tingling, numbness, burning sensations, or sharp pain, typically in the hands and feet.

**What to Do If You Experience Nerve Pain While Taking B6**

If you are experiencing nerve pain and taking supplements containing Vitamin B6, it is highly recommended to:

Consult Your Healthcare Professional: Discuss your symptoms and all the supplements you are taking with your doctor. They can help determine if there is a connection between your B6 intake and your nerve pain.

Review Supplement Labels: Pay close attention to the dosage and the form of Vitamin B6 in all your supplements, as the combined daily intake from multiple products can add up.

It's crucial to follow personalized medical guidance, as managing nerve pain and supplement use requires careful consideration of individual health circumstances.

## What additional strategies can I implement to effectively lower my blood sugar and cholesterol levels?

When managing diabetes and insulin resistance, understanding medications like metformin is key. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity, but if blood sugars remain high despite a low-carb diet, it could indicate that insulin receptors need further support or that the liver is producing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources.

To address this, stick to your current diet and consider adding supplements like berberine, apple cider vinegar, and cinnamon, as well as herbs like ginseng and turmeric to support liver function. Healing the liver can take time, sometimes up to three years, but with consistent efforts, you can improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control.

***

## What advantages does having a diverse gut microbiome confer on overall health?

Having a diverse microbiome is crucial for overall health as it supports various bodily functions and protects against harmful bacteria. A lack of microbial diversity can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea, gut inflammation, and metabolic issues like obesity and slow metabolism. Conversely, a rich variety of microbes offers benefits like vitamin synthesis, immune support, inflammation regulation, and energy production. Maintaining microbiome diversity is essential for optimal health and well-being.

***

## What advice do you have for someone with chronic pancreatitis?

I would take TUDCA because it could be related to the little bile duct that's backing up and it's putting pressure onto the pancreatic duct that's causing some inflammation. TUDCA has some great benefits for pancreatitis but of course in this situation I'd always like to go right for the diet.

***

## What alternative sources of vitamin C can be included in your child's diet if she is allergic to most fruits and carrots?

Ensuring your child gets enough vitamin C can be challenging if they're allergic to most fruits and carrots. Here are some professional recommendations:

1\. **Supplements**: Consider vitamin C supplements as a reliable source.

2\. **Alternative Foods**: Include sauerkraut, which is high in vitamin C, despite its less appealing taste for kids.

3\. **Berries**: If your child is not allergic, berries are an excellent source of vitamin C.

These options should help meet your child's vitamin C needs.

***

## What approaches can I take to manage ulcers for both my child and myself, particularly in the context of acid reflux?

For managing ulcers and acid reflux, the key is dietary changes. Reduce sugar and refined flour intake, and incorporate salads with radish or broccoli sprouts, which contain sulforaphane to combat H. pylori. Healing can be supported with cabbage juice and zinc.

Avoid acidifiers like apple cider vinegar until the ulcer heals, which can take several months. If intense burning occurs, a small amount of baking soda can provide relief without worsening the condition. Proper diet and careful management are crucial for recovery.

## What are 7 bad habits that can ruin your liver?

**7 Lifestyle Factors That Damage Your Liver (And How to Fix Them)**

1. **Overuse of Over-the-Counter Medications:**
   * Surprisingly, common painkillers like Tylenol can lead to serious liver damage if taken excessively. It's crucial to be aware of the potential risks of all medications, even those available without a prescription. Don't assume they're harmless just because they're easily accessible.
   * Natural remedies like milk thistle and NAC can offer liver support.
2. **Leading a Sedentary Lifestyle:**
   * When you consume more calories than you burn, it stresses your body at the cellular level. Regular exercise not only helps you manage your weight but also boosts your immune system, improves circulation, and reduces stress – all of which benefit your liver. Make physical activity a regular part of your routine.
3. **Poor Dietary Choices:**
   * The combination of seed oils (like vegetable or canola oil) with sugar or starch is a recipe for liver damage. These ingredients are found in most processed foods and contribute to insulin resistance, a major factor in fatty liver disease, obesity, and other health issues.
4. **Prioritizing Convenience Over Nutrition:**
   * Busy schedules often lead to grabbing fast food or unhealthy snacks. These choices typically lack essential nutrients and can harm your liver. Plan your meals ahead of time so you're not tempted to make poor choices on the go.
5. **Chronic Stress:**
   * Stress disrupts sleep, affects blood sugar, and can even weaken your immune system. Vitamin B1, vitamin D, exercise, and spending time in nature can all help manage stress levels.
6. **Excessive Alcohol Consumption:**
   * Alcohol is processed directly by your liver, putting a significant strain on it. Sugary mixed drinks are particularly harmful. Limit your alcohol intake and avoid making it a daily habit.
7. **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
   * Your liver needs specific nutrients to function optimally. Include plenty of cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, kale), garlic, onion, and quality protein sources like grass-fed beef and wild-caught fish in your diet to support liver health.

Remember, your liver plays a vital role in your overall health. Taking steps to protect it can have a major positive impact on your well-being.

## What are effective ways to support bile flow?

The discomfort you’re experiencing may not originate from the gallbladder itself, but rather from the bile ducts, where thicker bile and cholesterol can create pressure and lead to pain.

To address this issue, it's important to promote bile flow. Incorporating choline into your daily regimen and taking bile salts with meals can help enhance bile production, facilitating a smoother flow through the ducts and alleviating discomfort. You may need a higher dosage than average to achieve optimal results.

During this time, it's advisable to avoid nuts, peanut butter, and dairy products. Moderate consumption of saturated fats from meat can actually stimulate bile production without worsening your condition. However, be cautious with coconut oil, vegetable oils, and fried foods high in omega-6 fatty acids, as these can exacerbate the problem. On the other hand, fatty fish like salmon should not aggravate gallbladder issues and can be beneficial.

***

## What are kidney stones, and what effective strategies and treatments can be employed to eliminate them and prevent their recurrence?

To prevent kidney stones, maintain hydration by drinking 2-3 liters of fluids daily, ideally with electrolytes like potassium citrate. Limit oxalate-rich foods such as almonds and spinach, especially on a ketogenic diet. Increase dietary calcium from sources like cheese to bind oxalates in the gut.

If fat malabsorption is an issue, additional calcium may help reduce oxalate absorption. Supplementing with citrates—like lemon juice or potassium, magnesium, and calcium—can lower oxalate levels. Balance urinary pH by increasing vegetable intake or using potassium citrate, especially for uric acid stones.

Support gut health with probiotics and ensure sufficient magnesium and vitamin D intake. Additionally, consider adding salt and vitamin K2 to help prevent calcification.

***

## What are normal blood iron levels?

Blood iron levels can be measured in a few ways, including serum iron, ferritin, and total iron binding capacity (TIBC). Consult with your medical professional to conduct testing, review results, and build a healthy blood iron plan.

*   **Serum iron**

    Normal levels for men are 50–150 mcg/dL, and for women are 35–145 mcg/dL. Low levels for men are below 76 mcg/dL, and for women are below 26 mcg/dL. High levels for men are above 198 mcg/dL, and for women are above 170 mcg/dL.
*   **Ferritin**

    Normal levels for men are 30–400 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL), and for women are 13–150 ng/mL. Low levels may indicate iron deficiency anemia, while high levels may indicate hemochromatosis.
*   **Total iron binding capacity (TIBC)**

    Normal levels for men are 171–505 mcg/dL, and for women are 149–492 mcg/dL.

Medical professionals, not Dr. Berg, have established these low, high, and normal blood iron test levels. These levels are provided for informational purposes only. Please consult your medical doctor to discuss more detailed and individualized information on blood iron levels.

## What are PFAs?

PFAS chemicals are called forever chemicals because they stay in the environment for thousands of years. They’ve been found in our fat cells and breast milk and are especially problematic in our drinking water. PFAS are linked to many health problems, including cancer, hormone problems, liver damage, and reproductive damage.

Forever chemicals are everywhere! They’re found in Teflon cookware, food packaging, and canned goods, and firefighters are exposed to them when they use their foam. PFAS were first introduced into the environment in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Companies used loopholes by conducting their own studies to classify their products as GRAS (generally recognized as safe).

To avoid the toxic side effects of PFAS, you should limit your exposure and build up your body’s tolerance to these toxic chemicals. The EWG (Environmental Working Group) evaluated 25 PFAS chemicals and found that only 3 water filters could effectively remove them from drinking water: Travel Berkey Gravity, Clearly Filtered, and Zero Water. Because the water supply exposes you to many of the forever chemicals, it’s a good idea to invest in a good water filter.

Forever chemicals build up in the body but don’t come out very easily. Here are some of the ways you can eliminate PFAS from the body and minimize their health effects:

•Sweating

•Autophagy

•Infrared light exposure

•Consuming spirulina and chlorella

Your body has detoxification enzymes that can help you eliminate poisons naturally. To help detoxify the body, consume foods with sulfur, such as eggs, garlic, and onion. Cruciferous vegetables like cabbage, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts are high in sulfur and other antioxidants that can help the detoxification process. Glutamine is a vital antioxidant that can help increase glutathione in the body. Red meat is the best source, and glycine and probiotics are also essential. It’s almost impossible to create a toxin-free environment! Trace minerals such as selenium, iodine, and copper, found in seafood and grass-fed red meat can help strengthen the biochemical pathways in your body to help eliminate forever chemicals.

## What are some great tips for when you are sick?

Viral infection symptoms will be more systemic. If you have a viral infection, you’ll notice more body aches and chills. Bacterial infection symptoms will be localized. Fevers are typically higher with a bacterial infection. A sore throat associated with a viral infection is often accompanied by a runny nose and a cough. If a sore throat is caused by a bacterial infection, you’ll feel more localized pain without a runny nose. A dry cough is associated with a viral infection, while bacterial infections are associated with a productive cough. Respiratory infection, the common cold, flu, bronchitis, and infections involving the sinuses and lungs are generally viral. Pneumonia can be both bacterial and viral. A viral infection typically lasts 1 to 2 weeks. A bacterial infection will probably last a bit longer, but this depends on your immune system. Mucus associated with a viral infection is usually clear or white and green or yellow with a bacterial infection.

The best viral infection remedies are elderberry and olive leaf extract. For bacterial infections, try garlic, oregano oil, and echinacea. The following remedies for infection work for both viral and bacterial infections:

•Take a hot bath or shower/dress warm

•Get more sleep

•Take zinc, vitamin D, and vitamin C

•Fasting

•Increase sea salt intake

•Improve emotional state

•Get more sunlight (UVB and infrared rays)

•Take cod liver oil

## What are some health tips to approach with caution?

### 7 Health Tips to Approach With Caution:

This list explores some health ideas that might require a closer look before incorporating them into your routine.

1. **Question Everything, Even From Doctors:** While doctors are experts, it's wise to be an informed patient. Ask questions, research advice, and consider seeking second opinions for complex issues.
2. **Protein Powders: Not a Magic Bullet:** Powders can be a convenient source of protein, but they lack the full spectrum of nutrients found in whole food sources like meat. Aim for a balanced diet that includes protein-rich whole foods whenever possible.
3. **Treating Symptoms vs. Root Causes:** While medication can provide relief, addressing underlying causes of health problems promotes long-term well-being. Discuss a holistic approach with your healthcare provider.
4. **Potassium for Blood Pressure, Not Just Salt Reduction:** Potassium is crucial for heart health. However, a balanced approach to electrolytes is essential. Consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance on blood pressure management.
5. **Think Quality, Not Just Fat Type:** Focus on the source of fats. Saturated fats from whole foods like red meat can be part of a healthy diet, while highly processed unsaturated fats, like seed oils, should be limited.
6. **Red Meat: Enjoy in Moderation:** Red meat offers valuable nutrients, but moderation is key.
7. **Look Beyond Nutrition Labels:** Nutrition labels provide a basic overview, but ingredient lists reveal more. Watch out for added sugars, hidden sugars in syrups and starches, and highly processed seed oils. Starches can significantly impact blood sugar, even if labeled as zero sugar.

**Remember:** It's always best to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for personalized dietary and health advice.

## What are some important signs of too high sugar consumption?

Now that we’ve covered the basics of how excess sugar can lurk in our diets, let’s explore the lesser-known consequences. Here are seven surprising signs you might be having a little too much of the sweet stuff.

Recognizing these signs early is crucial to nipping potential health problems in the bud. It can also help you make healthier food choices and decrease your intake of foods with added sugar.

#### **1. Premature Aging and Reduced Collagen**

Think of collagen as your body's natural [anti-aging remedy](https://www.drberg.com/blog/anti-aging) - it's what keeps our skin firm, elastic, and youthful-looking. However, excess sugar throws a wrench into collagen production through a process called [glycation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-are-advanced-glycation-end-products-ages).

Over time, this leads to wrinkles, sagging skin, and a general aged appearance. So if you're noticing more fine lines and wrinkles than you'd like, that daily sugary soda could be a culprit.

It's like prematurely robbing your skin of its youthful glow. Limiting added sugar in your diet can have a positive impact on your skin.

#### **2. Persistent White Tongue**

A persistently white tongue is not just aesthetically unappealing but can also be a symptom of candida overgrowth. [Candida](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-powerful-candida-and-yeast-killer) is a naturally occurring yeast in the body.

However, too much sugar disrupts the delicate balance, allowing Candida to flourish on the surface of your tongue. This leads to the stubborn white coating often associated with this imbalance.

It's not enough to brush it away. To address the root of the issue, you often need to cut back on sugar and starve those yeast overgrowths. High-sugar diets create an ideal environment for Candida to thrive, leading to this uncomfortable condition.

#### **3. Chronic Sinus Problems**

We often associate sinus problems with allergies or colds, but did you know they can also be linked to sugar? This one might come as a surprise.

As with the white tongue, an overgrowth of certain fungi can contribute to those stuffy noses and sinus headaches we often experience. And guess what those fungi thrive on? You got it—sugar.

A common culprit in [chronic sinus problems](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-food-for-chronic-sinus-issue) is the fungus Aspergillus, which just loves to feast on sugar. Addressing a chronic sinus infection could involve cutting back on those sugary treats as part of a holistic plan.

Reducing sugar intake starves these fungi and may help in managing chronic sinus issues.

#### **4. Red or Pink Gums**

Next time you brush your teeth, pay attention to what you see on the bristles. A bit of pink, especially if it's more than usual, might indicate a very, very mild version of scurvy—yes, scurvy.

This [vitamin C deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/an-interesting-cause-of-a-vitamin-c-deficiency) often appears as gum problems and is linked to excess sugar consumption. Why? Because sugar can interfere with your body's absorption and utilization of vitamin C.

#### **5. Low Testosterone**

Men, listen up. Did you know there is a surprising connection between sugar and testosterone? While the complexities of hormones and diet go beyond simple cause and effect, a diet high in sugar has been linked to dips in testosterone levels.

These imbalances often manifest as decreased libido, trouble building muscle (which we usually attribute solely to exercise and protein), and even low energy levels.

It's always essential to work with a healthcare provider to diagnose the root cause of any hormonal changes you're experiencing.

If you suspect your diet is impacting your hormone levels, consider consulting a registered dietitian or a certified nutritionist for personalized guidance.

#### **6. Susceptibility to Infections**

A robust immune system is our best defense against infections. However, excessive sugar can suppress the immune response, leaving you more vulnerable to various pathogens.

It's as if those extra sugary treats disarm your immune system, making it less effective at fighting off unwanted invaders. So if you’re finding yourself getting sick often, it might be worthwhile to examine your sugar intake as part of a bigger picture.

Eating too much sugar can weaken the body's natural defenses. By reducing your sugar intake, you can support your immune system's ability to fight off infections and stay healthy.

#### **7. High Adrenaline Levels**

When we think of high adrenaline, we often think of stress, right? But it turns out excess sugar consumption can be a hidden stressor for our bodies. Here's how: High sugar intake disrupts your cells' ability to create energy efficiently.

To compensate, your body churns out adrenaline—not necessarily due to mental stress, but because of this cellular energy chaos.

This explains why fatigue can sometimes be accompanied by nervous, jittery energy, often accompanied by restlessness. And it doesn't stop there—chronic adrenaline surges disrupt sleep, potentially leading to conditions like restless leg syndrome.

The effects extend to digestion (think sugar-induced heartburn.) and may even contribute to clotting risks in certain individuals.

## What are some important warning body signs that shouldn't be ignored?

These are important warning signs that shouldn't be ignored. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment if you experience any of these symptoms.

**5 Warning Signs You Shouldn't Normalize**

1. **Chronic Fatigue:** While fatigue can be a normal part of life, persistent exhaustion that doesn't improve with rest can be a sign of underlying issues like anemia, vitamin deficiencies, infections, or even chronic diseases.
2. **Sudden Weight Loss:** Unexplained weight loss, especially if it's significant, can be a red flag for conditions like hyperthyroidism, diabetes, or even cancer.
3. **Persistent Weakness:** Feeling weak all the time can be due to nutrient deficiencies (iron, magnesium, potassium, vitamin E), but it can also be linked to more serious conditions like anemia or neurological problems.
4. **Chronic Diarrhea:** Occasional diarrhea is common, but if it lasts for weeks or is accompanied by other symptoms like blood in the stool, it's important to investigate potential causes like infections, food intolerances, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
5. **Persistent Stomach Pain:** Stomach pain that doesn't go away or gets worse could be a sign of gallstones, ulcers, pancreatitis, or even certain types of cancer.

**Important Note:**

* **Self-Diagnosis and Treatment:** While the suggestions you've provided (probiotics, intermittent fasting, etc.) may be helpful for some individuals, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plans.
* **Rare but Serious Conditions:** While many of these symptoms can be linked to less serious conditions, it's important to remember that they can also be signs of rare but potentially life-threatening illnesses.
* **Seek Professional Help:** If you're experiencing any of these warning signs, don't hesitate to reach out to a doctor or other healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation.

By paying attention to your body and seeking help when needed, you can ensure that any underlying health issues are addressed promptly and effectively.

## What are some of the most frequently ignored signs of heart disease that individuals often overlook?

Certainly! Heart disease often manifests through subtle signs that are crucial to recognize:

1\. **Arrhythmia**: Irregular heartbeats can indicate electrolyte imbalances, particularly low potassium or magnesium levels.

2\. **Calcium**: Essential for muscle contraction, both deficiency and excess can impact heart rhythm and arterial health.

3\. **Vitamin D3 and K2**: Vitamin D3 enhances calcium absorption, while K2 helps prevent calcium buildup in arteries, crucial for cardiovascular health.

4\. **Magnesium**: Deficiency can lead to muscle cramps, including those in the heart, emphasizing its role in heart muscle function.

5\. **Sodium and Potassium**: Sodium imbalances affect blood pressure, while potassium is vital for nerve and muscle function, including maintaining a steady heartbeat.

6\. **Insulin Resistance**: Impairs mineral absorption, contributing to arterial plaque and cardiovascular complications.

7\. **Adrenaline**: Stress-induced heart attacks highlight the role of adrenaline in vasodilation and coronary artery health.

8\. **Vitamin B1**: Critical for heart function and preventing enlargement, deficiency can lead to respiratory and vascular issues.

Understanding and addressing these nutritional and physiological factors can significantly support heart health and prevent cardiovascular disease.

## What are some optimal food choices for brain and eye health?

### **Navigating Dietary Choices for Optimal Brain and Eye Health**

Navigating dietary choices for optimal brain and eye health involves selecting foods rich in nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins crucial for cognitive function and vision.

By incorporating fatty fish, leafy greens, berries, and nuts into your diet, you can provide essential nutrients that support brain function and protect against age-related eye conditions.

Understanding the impact of dietary choices on brain and eye health can empower individuals to make informed decisions to maintain cognitive sharpness and visual acuity throughout life.

![Selection of ketogenic foods](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/healthy-low-carbs-products-ketogenic-diet-0.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **Incorporating Fish into Your Diet**

Diving into a diet abundant with these underwater wonders, like salmon and mackerel, elevates your brainpower and enhances your eyesight.

Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for constructing brain cell barriers and play a pivotal part in maintaining the health of your retina.

But it's not just about throwing fish onto your plate willy-nilly. Variety is key. Mixing up your fish intake ensures you get both DHA and EPA types of omega-3s - essential for mental clarity and reducing inflammation that could cloud your vision.

To ensure you're hitting the mark with omega-3 intake without breaking the bank or getting bored at dinner time, consider adding flaxseeds or walnuts to salads for an extra crunch of these vital nutrients when seafood isn't on the menu.

#### **Vegan Alternatives for Omega-3s**

If you’re navigating a plant-based path but still want those juicy cognitive benefits from omega-3s, don’t fret. Microalgae supplements are a fantastic vegan source of DHA. They directly provide what fish consume to become rich in these fatty acids.

For everyday eating, chia seeds, hemp seeds, and walnuts offer ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), which our bodies can convert into EPA and DHA, albeit less efficiently than consuming them directly from animal sources or algae-based supplements.

So sprinkle some on oatmeal or blend them into smoothies.

## What are some overlooked signs of an iodine deficiency?

Overlooked signs of an iodine deficiency:

1\. Estrogen dominance. Iodine helps regulate estrogen and helps prevent estrogen dominance. It also supports detoxification.

2\. High cortisol levels. Iodine helps normalize cortisol levels.

3\. A hypothyroid condition. Hypothyroidism can cause the cholesterol in your body to be elevated but unusable for making vitamin D, cell membranes, and bile.

4\. Side effects when consuming soy products. Iodine helps buffer the estrogen effects of consuming soy products.

5\. Hashimoto's. You still need iodine if you have Hashimoto's, but not excess iodine. You may also need selenium, zinc, vitamin D, and myo-inositol.

***

## What are some quick methods to reduce acid reflux?

Heartburn is not a problem resulting from too much acid—it's a valve problem. Keeping the pH of the stomach between 1 and 3 keeps the valve shut.

**How to get rid of heartburn naturally:**

**1. The most important nutrient to eliminate and prevent heartburn is vitamin B1 (thiamine).** Your stomach can not produce acid when you’re deficient in vitamin B1. A diet high in carbs depletes B1. Low B1 deprives the autonomic nervous system, which controls the valves of the stomach. Look for a natural source of vitamin B1 to get rid of heartburn.

**2. Potassium and zinc are very important for your stomach acid.** Try a good electrolyte powder and trace mineral supplement to increase your intake of these important minerals. Also, make sure you’re getting plenty of sea salt.

**3. Increase your stomach acid.** This triggers the valve at the top of the stomach to close. Apple cider vinegar and betaine hydrochloride can help acidify the stomach.

It’s important to note that if apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride causes burning, you may have gastritis or an ulcer. In this situation, you need to heal the stomach before taking apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride.

***

## What are some really serious symptoms of potassium deficiency?

Extremely low potassium levels can be life-threatening. Seek immediate medical help if you experience the following potassium deficiency symptoms:

* Severe Muscle Weakness: This goes beyond general weakness and involves your muscles not functioning as they should. Severe muscle weakness might even lead to paralysis.
* Difficulty Breathing: This occurs because low potassium can disrupt the muscle function involved in breathing.
* Confusion and Mood Changes: This symptom is more than just brain fog. With severe potassium deficiency, you can become confused or disoriented and have sudden, extreme mood shifts.

***

## What are some red flags for shoulder pain?

Severe swelling or bruising around the joint, deformity in appearance, inability to move the arm without intense discomfort, and fever accompanying localized tenderness or warmth at touch are red flags indicating underlying severe issues related to shoulder pain.

Seek immediate medical attention if any red flag symptoms arise.

***

## What are some severe potassium deficiency symptoms?

As a potassium deficiency progresses, you may encounter more severe potassium deficiency symptoms, some of which are serious:

* Heart Palpitations: Feeling like your heart is skipping a beat or fluttering? These sensations, known as heart palpitations, can be unnerving. While not all palpitations indicate a severe problem, persistent palpitations could result from low potassium. Because potassium plays such a vital role in regulating your heartbeat, an imbalance can throw your heart rhythm off. You might feel an occasional flutter or more noticeable, rapid beats in your chest. If this is something you've experienced, getting your potassium levels checked is crucial.
* Numbness and Tingling: That “pins-and-needles” sensation you get when your foot falls asleep is tingling (also known as paresthesia), often occurring alongside numbness, where you lose sensation. Potassium plays a role in nerve health and function. When your potassium drops too low, nerve signals may misfire. This often presents as numbness or that odd tingling feeling, mainly in your extremities, like hands and feet.
* Muscle Weakness: Low potassium can manifest as muscle weakness beyond the occasional cramp. If you’re having a hard time going about your daily activities due to weakness, look into low potassium as a possible cause. Weakness in severe cases of hypokalemia can lead to paralysis, this is when it becomes a medical emergency.

## What are some things that slow down mitochondrial function?

While exploring ways to support healthy mitochondrial function is intriguing, being mindful of factors that can negatively impact these processes is equally important.

Just as certain lifestyle choices can promote mitochondrial uncoupling, others can hinder it. Understanding these factors can empower you to make informed choices that support your overall health and well-being.

Some factors that can affect mitochondrial function include:

* Consuming too many calories.
* Excessive snacking between meals.
* Leading a sedentary lifestyle.
* Exposure to environmental toxins like heavy metals.
* Certain medications.

***

## What are some things to avoid if you are over 50?

1\. Don’t take health advice from inexperienced people.

2\. Don’t be too quick to accept a diagnosis.

3\. Avoid solutions that create more problems.

4\. Avoid excessive stress.

The most important nutrient for people over 50 is vitamin D. Vitamin D influences 10% of your genes. You need at least 10,000 IU of vitamin D or more to produce a therapeutic effect. Doctors worldwide are using vitamin D3 for many health concerns, including autoimmune diseases, eye problems, and fibroids.

Magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D work together in a synergistic relationship. Magnesium is vital for heart health and energy. Avoid calcium and iron supplements as you age. It’s very difficult to rid the body of excess iron.

You don’t need to avoid salt! Opt for sea salt and make sure you’re getting plenty of potassium. Sodium deficiency can cause increased cortisol levels, which can interfere with sleep.

Cholesterol is an essential building block of sex hormones, so you must get enough after menopause. Cholesterol is essential for our brain, bile salts, and other hormones. Butter, eggs, dairy, and shellfish are the best dietary sources of cholesterol.

Focus on removing carbs from the diet and prioritizing quality protein. Grass-fed beef or lamb is the best source of protein.

Frequent eating stimulates insulin, which is the root cause of many chronic illnesses, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and a fatty liver.

Autoimmune diseases are related to low vitamin D and the microbes, viruses, and other pathogens that downgrade the vitamin D receptor. After severe stress or shock, your immune system becomes suppressed, leaving you vulnerable to autoimmune disease.

* **Hormonal Imbalance:** Affecting testosterone levels and thyroid function, leading to low energy and mood swings.
* **Cognitive Decline:** Memory problems, learning difficulties, and trouble with spatial location.

**Diet Matters: The Zinc Absorption Puzzle**

The food you eat plays a major role in how well your body absorbs zinc. Refined carbohydrates and foods high in phytic acid (like whole grains and legumes) can hinder zinc absorption.

**Unmasking the Deficiency**

* **The Zinc Taste Test:** Swish a zinc sulfate solution and note the taste. A metallic taste suggests adequate zinc levels, while a watery taste may indicate a deficiency.
* **Blood Tests & Hair Analysis:** Provide accurate data on your zinc levels, guiding dietary adjustments or supplementation.

**Zinc's Impact on Hormones & Cognition**

* **Hormonal Health:** Zinc supports thyroid function and healthy testosterone levels. Deficiency can lead to fatigue, low mood, and other hormonal imbalances.
* **Cognitive Function:** Zinc is crucial for memory, learning, and spatial location. Low levels can impair cognitive abilities.

**Conclusion: Listen to Your Body**

Zinc deficiency symptoms can be subtle, but they're a call to action. Pay attention to these signs and take steps to ensure you're getting enough zinc through diet or supplementation.

Remember, understanding your body's needs is the first step towards optimal health. Don't let zinc deficiency be the silent saboteur of your well-being.

## What are some ways to manage Sjögren’s syndrome?

While I don't have personal experience with it, autoimmune diseases can have a significant impact on the body, affecting connective tissues, skin, joints, and digestion. One potential approach to managing symptoms is to maintain high levels of vitamin D, which may help reduce inflammation and support remission of certain symptoms.

Additionally, adopting a healthy lifestyle through a ketogenic diet combined with intermittent fasting may promote overall health. Intermittent fasting, in particular, has been shown to support immune system healing.

**Please consult with a healthcare professional before making any changes to your health regimen or addressing medical conditions.**

***

## What are steroid drugs and what are side effects of them?

Corticosteroids are primarily used to manage inflammation, but they suppress the immune system, increasing susceptibility to infections like pneumonia and potentially activating latent tuberculosis. Long-term use can lead to adrenal suppression and withdrawal symptoms such as osteoporosis, ulcers, and diabetes. Alternatives include curcumin, boswellia, green tea, vitamin D, and fasting. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously and for short durations.

**Understanding Belly Bloat**

Bloating is that uncomfortable feeling of fullness and tightness in your stomach. It can be caused by various factors, including:

* **Diet:** Certain foods, especially those high in FODMAPs, can trigger gas production and bloating. Eating too quickly or consuming large meals can also strain your digestive tract.
* **Medical Conditions:** IBS and lactose intolerance are common conditions often associated with bloating.
* **Other Factors:** Swallowing air, carbonated drinks, and hormonal changes can also contribute.

**Foods That Fight Bloating**

* **High-Fiber Foods:** Soluble fiber, found in avocado, sunflower seeds, and hazelnuts, can reduce bloating by absorbing water and softening stool. However, excessive insoluble fiber from vegetables and whole grains can lead to gas and bloating. Gradually increase your intake and choose low-gas options like berries, citrus fruits, and cooked vegetables.
* **Ginger Tea:** Ginger has anti-inflammatory and carminative properties, soothing the digestive tract and relieving gas.

**Worst Foods for Bloating**

* **Cruciferous Vegetables:** Broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts are nutritious but can cause bloating due to their high FODMAP content. Cooking them thoroughly and consuming them in moderation can help.
* **Dairy Products:** For those with lactose intolerance, dairy can trigger bloating. Try lactose-free alternatives or fermented dairy products with probiotics.
* **High-Sodium Foods:** Excess salt leads to water retention, exacerbating bloating. Choose whole, unprocessed foods, low-sodium options, and increase potassium intake.

**Lifestyle Changes**

* **Mindful Eating:** Eating slowly and chewing thoroughly reduces air swallowing and aids digestion.
* **Hydration:** Drinking plenty of water prevents constipation and bloating.

**Bloating and Fasting**

Bloating during fasting can occur due to changes in eating patterns. Stay hydrated, consume fiber-rich foods during non-fasting periods, avoid carbonated drinks, and consider natural remedies like peppermint or ginger tea.

**Conclusion**

Understanding the best and worst foods for belly bloating empowers you to make informed dietary choices and enjoy your meals without discomfort. Remember, a balanced diet, mindful eating, and proper hydration are key to a happier gut.

## What are the best dietary tips for managing hypothyroidism?

Tip #1 - Don’t go on a low-calorie diet. Why? Because you also lower your nutrition, which starves the metabolism. Low-calorie diets end up slowing down your thyroid even more. You need plenty of nutrients, so don’t starve your body.

Tip #2 - Avoid pre-packaged foods. Most pre-packaged foods contain something called soy protein isolates. What are these? They are a very low-quality protein that interferes with the thyroid and the liver. These are not good for the body. Avoid soy at all costs

Tip #3 - Avoid stimulates. This includes things like phentermine and diet pills. When the thyroid is stimulated, you run the risk of burning it out down the road. Stay away from stimulates like these.

## What are the causes for low CO2?

This condition can be caused by several factors, including:

#### **Causes of Low CO2 (Hypocapnia)**

* **Asthma**: Respiratory conditions like asthma can lead to rapid breathing or hyperventilation, reducing CO2 levels.
* **COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)**: COPD can cause difficulty in breathing, leading to altered CO2 levels.
* **Panic Attacks and Anxiety**: These conditions often cause hyperventilation, which lowers CO2 levels.
* **Lung Infections**: Infections in the lungs can affect breathing patterns, potentially leading to reduced CO2.
* **Anemia**: This condition can impact oxygen and CO2 transport within the body.

#### **Remedies for Low CO2**

The context does not provide specific remedies targeted directly at increasing CO2 levels. However, addressing the underlying causes of hyperventilation and improving overall respiratory health can help manage CO2 levels. Some general approaches might include:

* **Managing Respiratory Conditions**: Proper treatment and management of conditions like asthma and COPD can help stabilize breathing patterns and CO2 levels.
* **Stress and Anxiety Management**: Techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or professional therapy can help manage panic attacks and anxiety, reducing instances of hyperventilation.
* **Improving General Respiratory Health**: Practices like regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking can support lung function and help maintain balanced CO2 levels.

## What are the causes for panic attacks?

Panic attacks can be intensely frightening experiences, but understanding their causes and knowing effective remedies can be incredibly helpful.

#### **Causes of Panic Attacks**

1. **High Amounts of Stress**: Excessive stress can overburden your adrenal glands (stress-regulating glands), leading to malfunction and an inability to properly manage stress levels.
2. **Respiratory Alkalosis**: This condition occurs when the pH of your lungs becomes too alkaline, often due to hyperventilation. It shares many symptoms with panic attacks, such as hyperventilation, dizziness, and palpitations.
3. **Oxygen Toxicity**: During a panic attack, flooding your lungs with too much oxygen and not enough CO2 can lead to oxygen toxicity, exacerbating the feeling of suffocation and air hunger.

#### **Remedies for Panic Attacks**

1. **Control Your Breathing**:
   * Breathe through your nose.
   * Slow down your breathing by counting 3-4 seconds in and 3-4 seconds out.
   * Use diaphragmatic breathing rather than chest breathing.
   * Take soft and gentle breaths.
   * Going outside for more space can also help.
2. **Immediate Stress Reduction**:
   * Slow your breathing (4 seconds in, 4 seconds out).
   * Take vitamin B1 (found in nutritional yeast or benfotiamine supplements).
   * Improve sleep quality and take naps if needed.
   * Engage in long walks outside for 45 to 60 minutes a day.
   * Avoid stress-inducing stimuli, like watching the news.
3. **Diet and Lifestyle**:
   * Following the Healthy Keto® diet may help manage underlying conditions that contribute to panic attacks.
   * Consuming adaptogens can help your body manage stress better.
   * Practice acupressure techniques for immediate relief.
4. **Support Your Nervous System**:
   * Supporting your nervous system through dietary changes, supplements like vitamin B1, and lifestyle adjustments can help manage stress and reduce the frequency of panic attacks.

Remember, while these remedies can be effective for managing panic attacks, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment, especially if panic attacks are frequent or severe. They can help identify any underlying conditions and recommend a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your needs.

## What are the causes for Respiratory Alkalosis?

Alkalosis is a condition where your body becomes too alkaline, meaning the pH level of your body fluids is higher than normal. The human body requires a specific balance of acidity and alkalinity to function correctly, with different parts of the body having different optimal pH levels. Alkalosis disrupts this balance, leading to various symptoms and health issues. It's important to maintain a balanced pH for overall health, avoiding being too acidic or too alkaline.

The remedies for alkalosis include:

* **Apple Cider Vinegar**: Consuming 1 to 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar stirred into about a cup of water is recommended. This can help balance the body's pH by introducing more acidity into the digestive system, which may counteract the effects of alkalosis.
* **Betaine Hydrochloride**: This is another remedy suggested for alkalosis. It can help increase stomach acid, which may be beneficial for those experiencing alkalosis symptoms due to low stomach acid levels.

It's important to note that while these remedies can be helpful, they are not substitutes for professional medical advice. If you're experiencing symptoms of alkalosis, such as muscle weakness, cramping, or breathing problems, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider to address the underlying causes and receive appropriate treatment.

## What are the causes for sunspots?

#### Sunspots, also known as liver spots or solar lentigines, are flat brown spots caused by excessive sun exposure and an overproduction of melanin, the skin pigment.

**Melanin, produced by melanocytes in the epidermis, increases due to UV radiation, leading to tanning and eventually sunspots.**

**Contributing Factors:**

\- Sun Exposure: Primary cause

\- Hormonal Changes: Pregnancy, menopause

\- Medications: Birth control pills, antibiotics

\- Genetics: Family history

**Most Affected: Sunspots are common in people over 40 with fair skin and a sun-exposed history.**

**Prevention Tips: Protect your skin from the sun regardless of age or skin type to prevent sunspots.**

## What are the causes of chest pain associated with costochondritis?

Costochondritis, or costosternal syndrome, causes pain and tenderness without clear trauma or lung infection. If no specific cause is identified, consider potential factors like vitamin D deficiency or issues related to the liver or gallbladder. For natural remedies:

\- Betaine hydrochloride before meals (3-5 capsules)

\- Purified bile salts (morning, after lunch, and afternoon on an empty stomach)

Consult a healthcare professional before starting supplements and ensure thorough medical evaluation to exclude other conditions.

• Leafy greens

• Probiotics

• Fermented foods

***

## What are the causes of low Vitamin D levels? (new video)

(new video)

Low vitamin D levels are caused by people staying indoors, location, skin color, and other lifestyle and genetic factors. Low vitamin D symptoms include:

•Low back pain

•High blood pressure

•Depression

•Anxiety

•Inflammation

•Poor immune function

Sunblock blocks the absorption of vitamin D. In 1980, society became sun phobic in an attempt to prevent skin cancer, which has continued to increase despite less sun exposure. You need 10,000 IUs of vitamin D daily, especially for immune function. This amount of vitamin D is the same amount you’d get from 20 minutes of sun exposure in the summertime.

When you get a blood test for vitamin D, they’re not checking for the active form and are not accounting for vitamin D resistance. Many things block the vitamin D receptor and contribute to vitamin D resistance, including genetics, plastics, forever chemicals, age, weight, inflammation, pregnancy, and lactation. Vitamin D3 won’t work without magnesium. As you increase your vitamin D intake, the demand for magnesium increases. Vitamin K2 and zinc are also vital when increasing your vitamin D dosage. Vitamin D has potent anti-cancer and anti-tumor benefits at therapeutic doses. It can also combat inflammation and autoimmune conditions. Dr. Coimbra of Brazil has seen positive effects with high doses of vitamin D in people with autoimmune conditions.

## What are the common causes of abdominal distention?

Abdominal distention, characterized by swelling and discomfort after meals, can stem from various causes:

1\. **Microbial Fermentation:**

\- Overload of carbohydrates and excessive fiber can lead to microbial fermentation in the gut, causing gas and distention.

\- Remedies include reducing carb and fiber intake, using apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride before meals, and consuming ginger, fennel seeds (avoid during pregnancy), anise, peppermint, and cooked vegetables. Probiotics can also help.

2\. **Food Sensitivities and Intolerances:**

\- Intolerance to FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols), lectins, or specific allergens can cause inflammation and digestive issues.

\- Remedies involve avoiding high-FODMAP foods like certain fruits, dairy products, wheat, and legumes, and substituting with low-FODMAP alternatives. Avoiding high-lectin foods and allergens while maintaining a food diary can help identify triggers.

3\. **Gluten and Grains Consumption:**

\- Gluten and grains are common culprits for bloating. Avoiding these foods can alleviate symptoms.

\- Remedies include eliminating gluten-containing foods such as bread, pasta, and cereals, as well as other grain products, sugars, and alcoholic beverages.

Other Considerations:

\- Addressing factors like lack of bile, liver health, excessive fiber intake, large meal consumption, SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth), frequent eating, intolerance to lectins, fat intolerance, adrenal fatigue, and protein overload may also help manage abdominal distention.

Natural Remedies:

\- Acupressure techniques can potentially aid in alleviating symptoms of abdominal distention.

Consulting a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment plan is recommended for persistent abdominal discomfort.

***

## What are the common causes of bedwetting?

Bedwetting is a common problem in children, but many adults can have accidents or near accidents too. Getting up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night has the same root cause as bedwetting.

**Cause #1: High insulin**

Bedwetting is caused by high levels of insulin. And that results from a high-carb diet. Carbohydrates spike your insulin levels. Over time, this causes the cells to develop a resistance to insulin--which then causes higher insulin production by your body. As you know, Insulin lowers blood sugar. When the blood sugar goes down your body lets go of excess liquid. This can happen at night.

**Remedies:**

* Avoid sugar and refined carbs
* Avoid grains
* Do an intermittent fasting plan
* Do a Healthy Keto® diet
* Consume vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)
* Consume vegetable shakes

**Get plenty of insulin-regulating nutrients**

• chromium • potassium • B vitamins (nutritional yeast)

***

## What are the common causes of bloodshot eyes?

Interestingly, vitamin B2 deficiency can cause your eyes to look bloodshot.

Low vitamin B2 can cause other symptoms related to your eyes, including itchy eyes, watery eyes, and light sensitivity.

**Aside from your eyes, a vitamin B2 deficiency may also cause symptoms such as:**

• Cracked or chapped lips

• Cracked corners of your mouth

• Oily nose

• Red tongue

• Migraines

The question is, what causes low vitamin B2? A vitamin B2 deficiency isn’t usually caused by not consuming enough foods with vitamin B2. Instead, it’s typically caused by a malabsorption situation.

There are two primary causes of poor vitamin B2 absorption. Inflammation in the digestive system can cause absorption issues, and refined carbohydrates can cause poor absorption. Bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, pancakes, waffles, biscuits, and all other refined carbohydrate products are very destructive to your digestive system. Avoid these at all costs.

## What are the common causes of constipation, and how do factors such as diet, hydration, and medical conditions contribute to this issue?

Constipation can stem from various factors, each with specific remedies:

1\. **Poor Gut Microbiome:**

\- **Cause:** Imbalance in gut bacteria affects food digestion.

\- **Remedies:** Take probiotics and eat fermented foods like sauerkraut and yogurt.

2\. **Low Bile:**

\- **Cause:** Insufficient bile leads to poor fat digestion.

\- **Remedies:** Use purified bile salts, increase saturated fats, and try gallbladder acupressure.

3\. **Low Stomach Acidity:**

\- **Cause:** Reduced stomach acid impairs nutrient breakdown.

\- **Remedies:** Take apple cider vinegar and betaine hydrochloride before meals.

4\. **Excess Fiber:**

\- **Cause:** Too much fiber, especially from grains, can worsen constipation.

\- **Remedies:** Avoid extra fiber, focus on improving digestion, slowly reintroduce fiber, and consider adding fruits.

Other factors include high fat intake, nut consumption, lactose intolerance, sensitivity to casein or certain vegetables, imbalance from excessive water intake without electrolytes, and stress.

These targeted remedies aim to enhance digestive function and gut health. Consult with healthcare providers for personalized advice.

## What are the common causes of cracked or chapped lips?

What’s causing cracked lips or chapped lips is really a vitamin B2 and B3 deficiency. What can create a deficiency in vitamin B2 and vitamin B3? Consuming too many refined-flour products is a really big cause. I’m talking about foods like bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, and waffles.

**More potential causes behind cracked lips:**

• Zinc deficiency

• Vitamin A deficiency

• Alcohol

**The best food that’s rich in vitamin B2 and vitamin B3:**

• Organic pasture-raised egg yolks

***

## What are the common causes of crusty eyes?

Crusty eyes can indicate a vitamin A deficiency, particularly when there's dryness and thickened mucus. Vitamin A, found in animal products like eggs, beef liver, and cod liver oil, is crucial for eye health. Factors such as low iron, insufficient pancreatic enzymes, gallbladder issues, alcohol consumption, IBS, inflammation, and antibiotic use can hinder vitamin A absorption. Increasing intake from animal sources, like cod liver oil, can help alleviate crusty eyes, while addressing absorption issues is key for effective treatment.

7\. Poison ivy

8\. Tick bites

9\. Diabetes

10\. Polycythemia

11\. Parathyroid gland issues

12\. Uremia

13\. Liver issues

14\. Cholestasis

15\. Dry skin

Diabetes and polycythemia can cause itching due to poor circulation. Overactive parathyroid glands lead to excessive calcium, affecting nerves and causing itchiness. Liver issues and cholestasis can impair bile salt production, causing itching. Dry skin is often due to vitamin A or D deficiency. TUDCA and dietary changes can help reduce itching in liver conditions.

## What are the common causes of low back pain, and how do factors such as muscle strain, injuries, and underlying medical conditions contribute to this issue?

If you are experiencing pain in the low area of the back, this can have several causes. Most of them are connected to your kidneys. However, the pain could be due to muscle imbalances or a pinched nerve.

**Cause #1: Kidney stones / oxalates crystallization**

Oxalates are substances that are located in some foods. Oxalates can create crystallization in the kidneys, resulting in low back pain and kidney stones. The best way to resolve such a problem would be to avoid foods high in oxalates.

Additionally, consuming more water and other fluids should help with kidney stones in general. You also should take electrolytes to stay hydrated. Too acidic a body pH or consuming salts in high amounts can contribute to stone formation, specifically uric acid stones.

**Remedies:**

*   As a general remedy, do an acupressure technique to relieve pain in the back:

    • watch this video • draw an imaginary line through your body from an epicenter of your back • massage the area in the front that is directly opposite from the epicenter of your back pain • the best way to know if you have hit the right spot: it will be tender
*   Avoid these foods:

    • spinach • almonds • chocolate • rhubarb
* Consume lemon water to block oxalates
* Drink more water
* Consume electrolytes
* Consume moderate amounts of salts (reduce if needed)
* If you have too acid a pH (acidosis), alkalize the body:
  * consume more vegetables
  * take potassium citrate

**Cause #3: Too much protein**

Consuming too much protein can affect your kidneys and can result in low back pain. Additionally, if you consume a lot of protein, a large part of it will not be digested and will turn into waste products in your body. Protein should be consumed in moderate amounts daily (3 to 6 oz per meal).

**Remedies:**

* Consume moderate amounts of protein (3 to 6 oz per meal)

**Cause #4: Muscle imbalances and pinched nerves**

Muscle imbalance can cause low back pain. For example if you are developing only one set of leg muscles (like in cycling) without paying attention to additional or opposite ones, you can create additional pressure on your muscles and as result on your back. Another example would be sitting and crossing your legs only on one side and not doing the same with the other leg to balance it out; this can result in a pinched nerve on one side.

**Remedies:**

* If you find yourself repeatedly crossing your legs from one side, alternate and cross from the other side
* If you are cycling, work out your glutes and the back side of your legs to balance the muscles out
* You can also do yoga to strengthen your weak muscles
* As a general remedy, do an acupressure technique to relieve pain in the back:
  * watch this video
  * draw an imaginary line through your body from an epicenter of your back
  * massage the area in the front that is directly opposite from the epicenter of your back pain
  * the best way to know if you hit the right spot: it will be tender

**Other causes:**

*   Acidosis

## What are the common causes of low blood pressure?

Low blood pressure can cause a lot of problems if the causes are unknown and only symptoms are treated. Let’s take a look at common reasons behind it.

**Cause #1: Postural hypotension (POTS)**

Postural hypotension (or POTS) is a condition where, if you stand up too fast, you feel dizzy. This condition is linked to the low blood sugar that can result when your stress-regulating glands (adrenals) are worn out or you are deficient in vitamin B1. When weak adrenals or deficiency in B1 bring about low blood sugar, it can show up as POTS.

**Remedies:**

* Take vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

* Avoid refined carbs and sugar (they deplete you of vitamin B1)
* Avoid alcohol (depletes you of vitamin B1)
* Support your adrenals by doing the following:
  * improve sleep (take naps if needed)
  * regularly exercise (don’t overtrain)
  * take long walks outside (at least 45 minutes)
  * take magnesium
* take potassium
* You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support
* You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Cause #2: Dehydration**

If you don’t consume enough fluid in your diet this can result in dehydration of your body and, as a result, low blood pressure. Dehydration can be caused by vomiting, diarrhea, diuretics, not drinking enough fluid or lack of electrolytes (especially salt and potassium). Salt is very important for your body to be able to retain fluid, so make sure you are not deficient in it.

**Remedies:**

* Drink more fluids
* Take electrolytes high in potassium
* Consume more Himalayan sea salt
* Consume more vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)
* Avoid diuretics

**Other causes:**

* Medication (diuretics, antidepressants, HBP meds)
* Addison’s disease
* Iron deficiency (anemia)
* B12 and folate deficiency
* After eating your blood pressure can go low

* Runny nose (mucus)
* Headache
* Allergy like symptoms
* Can’t breath

**Cause #1: Fungus**

The most common fungus that causes nasal congestion is called aspergillus fumigatus. If you have not enough friendly bacteria in the body--for example after having a history of taking antibiotics--the result can be an overgrowth of this fungus. One thing to know is that fungus uses carbs, sugar and Iron as food. I suggest using natural antibiotics while building up friendly bacteria in your body.

**Remedies:**

* Take oregano oil
* Take garlic
* You can also do a nasal rinse (Watch this video.)
* Avoid iron in the foods
* Avoid dairy and carbs
* Do intermittent fasting
* Do prolonged fasting (once or twice a month).
*   As a general remedy for sinus relief:

    • take serrapeptase (200,000 IU)
* As a general remedy for sinus congestion:

• take serrapeptase (200,000 IU) • do an acupressure technique (Watch this video.) • mix 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in water and drink it

**Cause #2: Rhinovirus**

Rhinovirus is a type of viral infection that can affect your nose and can keep them inflamed and congested. Most of the time it is seasonal, however it can be chronic.

**Remedies:**

* Take zinc (150mg)
* Take vitamin D (20,000 IU)
* As a general remedy for sinus congestion:
  * take serrapeptase (200,000 IU)
  * do an acupressure technique (Watch this video.)
* mix 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in water and drink it

**Cause #3: Allergies**

Allergy means intolerance to certain types of foods or elements from outside, like pollen. Your body overreacts to the thing causing allergy, creating a lot of symptoms like inflammation, irritation, nose congestion etc. The best way to see if you have an allergy is to look back and see what you ate or were exposed to just before getting a sinus congestion. Chances are this is the unusual type of food or thing you were exposed to.

**Remedies:**

Take more vitamin A

* eat more meats
* virgin cod liver oil
* grass-fed butter
* kale

Improve the digestion of vitamin A by taking purified bile salts. As a general remedy for sinus congestion:

* take serrapeptase (200,000 IU)
* do acupressure technique (Watch this video.)
*   mix 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in water and drink it

## What are the common causes of nosebleeds?

Nosebleeds can give a lot of concern if you don’t know their cause and remedies. Consuming nutrients that support blood clotting can greatly help.

**Cause #1: Low vitamin K1**

Vitamin K1 is very important for your body. It has to do with blood clotting, and functions to stop you from bleeding. If you are deficient in K1, this can result in nosebleeds. Certain medications that have warfarin (chemical) can block vitamin K1.

**Cause #2: Sinus irritation**

Having an allergy, virus or infection can cause irritation of certain membranes (cell layers) in the sinus. This can cause bleeding from the nose.

**Cause #3: Low platelets**

Platelets are blood-clotters that flow through your blood. If you have a nutrient deficiency or some kind of liver disease, like cirrhosis or fatty liver, this condition can cause insufficient amounts of platelets to be produced by your body.

## What are the common causes of right shoulder blade pain?

There’s a connection between your liver and your right side shoulder blade. When you get pain in your right shoulder blade, there’s a good chance it could be your liver. Your liver is a huge source of this deferred pain.

The problem can also be the gallbladder or bile duct. This can also irritate the phrenic nerve, which is connected to the neck and shoulders.

**Inflammation and fatty liver are the two main causes of an irritated liver. This is often due to:**

1\. Alcohol

2\. High carb diets

3\. Too much iron

4\. Vegetable oils

5\. Medications

Your diet is by far the biggest factor in liver health. If we compare our diets now to back in the 70s, we can see just how bad things have gotten. Since the 70s, we have increased…

• Grains by 29%

• Corn by 300%

• Vegetable oil by 300%

All of these foods increase inflammation, which can cause liver issues.

## What are the common causes of shoulder muscle pain?

Shoulder muscle pain is often caused by referred pain, which is related to your liver and gallbladder. Junk food and alcohol intake are the major causes of damaging your liver and causing fatty liver disease. Many nutrient deficiencies can cause liver and gallbladder problems.

The best things for shoulder pain are:

• Eating a healthy diet

• Cutting out alcohol

• Taking care of your liver and gallbladder

• Consuming bitter cruciferous vegetables

• Consuming beet tops

The Liver is the only organ that can regenerate itself with time. However, many liver symptoms don’t show up until 90% of your liver is shot. At this point, the damage cannot be reversed. Take care of your liver now to avoid problems later.

## What are the common reasons for vitamin D deficiency?

Our bodies need about 1200 IUs of vitamin D per day. It might go up or down, depending on different factors. For example, are you stressed out? This could actually be one of the reasons for the deficiency of vitamin D.

**Foods high in vitamin D:**

• Cod liver oil

• Fatty fish

• Butter

• Cheese

• Cream

• Raw-milk

Most people get vitamin D from the sun.

**A few vitamin D benefits:**

• Supports bone health

• Supports the immune system

## What are the common reasons for waking up at night?

**Here are 7 reasons why you get up during your sleep:**

1\. High blood sugar: if you’re diabetic or prediabetic and you have high blood sugar you’ll end up peeing more (especially at night) because water attaches itself to the sugar in your body. If you’re new to my channel I put a link below to show you how to fix your blood sugar.

2\. High insulin, which relates to high blood sugar. Insulin stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, better known as fight or flight. Too much stimulation of this system means you can’t hold your bladder, resulting in more frequent urination. So you want to decrease insulin using the same system that fixes blood sugar.

3\. High cortisol. This is the adrenal hormone; the stress hormone. This disrupts the normal sleep cycle ranging from REM sleep to the deep delta wave sleep. You wake up at 2am when you should be in your deepest sleep. Check out the link below to my stress webinar. For now, take vitamin D3.

4\. Consuming coffee or tea; caffeine is a stimulant. Reduce your consumption and drink caffeine only in the morning.

5\. Too much artificial light, especially if you spend a lot of time in front of an LED screen. Put a full spectrum light on your desk. Also, go for a walk to offset all the sitting you do plus get sunlight on your face. Take off your dark glasses and let the light hit your eyes.

6\. Sleep apnea. First, take vitamin B1 in the form of nutritional yeast. And eat a low carb diet. There’s also a condition called lactic acidosis that’s a byproduct of eating too many carbs. It can throw off your pH (see point 7 below). B1 will help.

7\. pH imbalance can affect your sleep, whether your body is too alkaline or too acidic. You won’t be able to absorb minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium if your pH is off. You can take apple cider if it's too alkaline, or minerals if too acidic.

## What are the common symptoms associated with a skin rash, and how can these symptoms vary based on the underlying cause?

When you have poor blood clotting or nutrient deficiencies you may have red, pink or purple spots on your skin that can also itch. What is important to know is that for healthy functioning of the skin we need several vitamins. Let’s look at the known remedies for this condition.

**Cause #1: Bile deficiency**

Bile is a very important liquid that is produced in your liver and stored in your gallbladder. The main function of bile is digestion of fats as well as certain vitamins. Additionally, If you consume too much fat and are unable to digest it, this can cause skin rash. In such a case purified bile salts can help you digest fats.

**Cause #2: Vitamin B2 deficiency**

Vitamin B2 is very important for healthy levels of the skin as well as for proper digestion of fats. The more fat you eat, the more B2 you need. Lack of B2 in the body can cause skin rash.

**Cause #3: Allergies**

Allergy means intolerance to certain types of foods or environmental elements, like pollen. Your body overreacts to the thing causing allergy (allergen), creating a lot of symptoms like inflammation, irritation, etc. The best way to see if you have an allergy is to look back and see what you ate or were exposed to just before getting a rash. Chances are that there was an unusual type of food or an environmental substance you were exposed to.

**Detoxification:**

Additionally, while on keto and intermittent fasting, your body may go through a detoxification cycle. This is because you are burning and breaking down your body fat, which releases toxins that were stored in the fatty tissue. Therefore, fat-burning can cause this reaction.

* Increase vegetables
*   Take bentonite clay on an empty stomach

## What are the common symptoms associated with anemia that indicate a deficiency in red blood cells or hemoglobin?

Anemia means low body iron. Iron is a vital mineral that the body needs for growth and development. Sometimes eating iron-rich food is not going to remedy anemia because there may be another cause of the condition.

**Symptoms:**

* Fatigue
* Paleness
* Brittle nails
* Hair loss / thinning
* Irritation/twitching
* Pica (when you crave dirt or clay)
* Eating ice
* Low endurance
* Attention deficit disorder
* Rapid breathing
* Increased heart rate
* Poor memory
* Restless leg syndrome
*   Sensitivity to cold temperatures

***

## What are the common symptoms associated with estrogen dominance?

Estrogen is a hormone vital for women’s health and it is needed in smaller amounts for men. However, having too much estrogen can cause a lot of side effects.

**Symptoms:**

* Anxiety
* Irritability
* Breast tenderness
* Weepiness
* Cravings for chocolate
* Joint pain
* Acne
* Weight in hips and thighs
* Low libido
* Fibroids

**Cause #1: Consuming foods high in estrogen**

Consuming foods with high amounts of estrogen can cause estrogen dominance. The solution would be to consume foods that are natural estrogen blockers like cruciferous vegetables, while avoiding foods that have high amounts of this hormone.

**Cause #2: High percentage of body fat**

If you have a high percentage of body fat this can cause estrogen dominance. This is because your body fat produces estrogen itself. The less body fat you have the less estrogen will be produced by your own body.

***

## What are the common symptoms associated with histamine intolerance?

Histamine is involved in the immune system, and it’s present in certain foods. If you have histamine intolerance, your body will react to it with inflammation, fatigue, congestion and other symptoms.

Additionally, if you’ve had damage to your stomach or your intestines you could be deficient in a certain enzyme that helps you break down histamines.

**Symptoms:**

* Headaches
* Migraines
* Stuffy sinuses
* Diarrhea
* Asthma
* Palpitations
* Red skin
* Hives/itchiness
* Vertigo
* Low blood pressure

Consuming foods high in histamines

Consuming foods high in histamines will cause them to be high in your body. Your body as a result can treat them as dangerous compounds and activate your immune system when they are detected, causing a reaction to them.

## What are the common symptoms associated with prediabetes, and how can these signs vary in intensity among different individuals?

**Prediabetes symptoms:**

1\. Darkened skin (in the body folds)

2\. Poor memory

3\. Tired after eating

4\. Belly fat

5\. Hunger and cravings

6\. Slow healing

7\. Urination at night/increased thirst

8\. Dry mouth

9\. Itchy

10\. Blurred vision

The thing is, you could have all of these symptoms, and your blood sugar levels may still not be high. This is because, way before you get diabetes or even prediabetes, you have high insulin. You probably have high insulin from consuming a high-carb diet and eating too frequently.

Too much insulin is toxic, so you will develop insulin resistance. This can go on for years until you eventually develop prediabetes and then diabetes.

***

## What are the common symptoms associated with prostate enlargement?

Enlarged prostate is a common problem for men. There are some contradictory factors involved in the underlying causes for it. However, it has mostly hormonal reasons behind it.

**Cause #1: Too-high estrogen**

The reason some men experience prostate enlargement is too much estrogen in their bodies. Estrogen is a hormone that makes things grow. Typically, men have low amounts of estrogen in their bodies. The vast majority of estrogen that a man has comes from testosterone that is being converted to estrogen. Additionally, if you have a high percentage of body fat, this can cause higher production of estrogen.

**Cause #2: High insulin**

Another reason for prostate enlargement is high amounts of insulin (fat-storing hormone). Insulin is an anabolic hormone, which means it makes things grow. When you consume high amounts of sugar and carbs, this can cause the increase of insulin.

***

## What are the common symptoms associated with vitamin D deficiency, and how can this deficiency affect overall health and well-being?

Vitamin D is vital for your immune system, healthy blood pressure, sleep, and mood and it is very efficient as an anti-inflammatory. Along with many other great benefits from it, you can lower your pain levels by consuming vitamin D. Unfortunately, many people are vitamin D deficient. There are 1 billion people on this planet that are either deficient or have insufficiency of vitamin D. Let’s look at the common symptoms of deficiency.

**Symptoms:**

* Body aches
* Inflammation
* Difficulty waking up
* Stiffness
* Muscle weakness
* Spasms
* Liver disease
* Daytime drowsiness
* Mood changes
* High blood pressure
* Low immunity
* Sweaty head
* Structural problems (kids)
* Thyroid problems
* Iron deficiency
* Calcium deficiency
* Thickened skin
* Teeth problems
* Low calcium
* Loss of bone

***

## What are the common symptoms of iron deficiency?

Iron deficiency is prevalent globally, crucial for:

\- Oxygen transport, energy production, DNA synthesis, hemoglobin, myoglobin, neuroglobin, and T-lymphocyte function.

Symptoms include fatigue, rapid heart rate, restless legs, and poor concentration.

Daily iron needs: 8mg for most, 18mg for post-menopausal women, 27mg for pregnant women. Animal sources (meat, chicken, fish) are more absorbable than plant sources.

Absorption helpers: Vitamin A, copper, zinc. Avoid ferrous oxide supplements; opt for natural food sources. Don’t take calcium with iron to prevent absorption interference.

Common causes: Celiac disease, IBS, low stomach acidity, gastric bypass, inflammation, phytic acid, soy, and vegan diets.

Consult a healthcare provider for personalized iron supplementation advice.

***

## What are the common symptoms of tonsillitis, and how do they impact throat health and overall comfort?

Tonsillitis means inflamed tonsils. Tonsils are little glands on both sides of your inner throat. Tonsils are primarily involved in protecting your respiratory (breathing-related) organs from harmful microbes and viruses. In fact tonsils are the first line of your respiratory immune defense.

Symptoms:

* Infection in your throat
* Sore throat
* Inflamed tonsils
* Swollen throat

**Cause #1: High-carb diet**

Over years of practice I noticed a common characteristic of patients who had tonsil problems. Most of them were on a high-carb diet. Eating sugar and refined carbs will spike your insulin (fat- storing hormone), which in turn acts as an inflammatory hormone. This in itself can deplete your body of nutrients important for a healthy immune system.

**Cause 2: Weak immune system**

If you have a weak immune system, this can cause inflammation of your tonsils because they are part of it. Usually, tonsillitis is caused by viral or bacterial infection. Therefore, improving your ability to fight infections and bacteria will reduce the inflammation and improve the health of the body in general, including giving additional strength to your tonsils.

## What are the culprits behind a diarrhea?

#### **Causes and Symptoms of Diarrhea**

**Common Causes:**

\- Viral infections (stomach flu, rotavirus)

\- Bacterial infections (contaminated food/water)

\- Parasitic infections (giardia)

\- Chronic conditions (IBS, IBD, celiac disease)

\- Medications (antibiotics, chemotherapy)

\- Lactose intolerance and food sensitivities

**Symptoms:**

\- Loose, watery stools

\- Abdominal pain/cramping

\- Bloating and gas

\- Nausea and vomiting

\- Fever and chills

\- Dehydration (thirst, dry mouth, dark urine)

**Note: Viral infections are common in children (CDC). IBS affects 10-15% of U.S. adults (NIH).**

**Stay hydrated and rest. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist.**

***

## What are the dangers of excessive salt consumption?

Signs of consuming too much salt include:

\- Edema (swelling in eyes, hands, feet, or legs)

\- Thirst

\- High blood pressure

\- Headache

\- Restlessness

\- Irritability

\- Nausea

\- Fatigue

Signs of sodium deficiency include:

\- Weakness

\- Low blood pressure

\- Increased neurotransmitters

\- Vascular stiffness and high blood pressure

\- Insulin resistance

Insulin resistance often causes high blood pressure, influenced by factors like a high-carb diet or intermittent fasting. Diuretics, commonly used for hypertension, may lead to sodium and potassium loss. For those with sodium sensitivity or signs of deficiency, ensuring adequate potassium intake is crucial, alongside a balanced mineral intake. Sea salts like Baja Gold Sea Salt offer a comprehensive mineral profile, including lower sodium content.

## What are the dietary habits that cause gallstones?

### **Dietary Habits Leading to Gallstone Formation**

Regarding gallstones, the food you eat plays a crucial role. Contrary to popular belief, certain dietary habits contribute more to gallstone formation than fat consumption.

Eating too many grains and sugars can cause a spike in insulin, resulting in depleted bile stores and thus raising the possibility of gallstone formation.

#### **Impact of Grains on Insulin Levels**

The impact that grains have on our bodies is often underestimated. They are broken down into glucose during digestion, which then causes your blood sugar levels to rise rapidly.

This triggers your pancreas to release insulin - a hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels by facilitating glucose absorption into cells. However, consuming large amounts of grains regularly leads our body into a state known as insulin resistance.

In this condition, our cells become less responsive or resistant to insulin, making them unable to absorb glucose efficiently, causing high blood sugar and elevated insulin levels in the bloodstream.

This chronic elevation in insulin level is harmful to overall health and contributes significantly towards the depletion of bile reserves, thus paving the way for potential gallstone formation.

#### **Sugar Consumption and Gallstone Formation**

Sugar consumption is not only linked to numerous health issues but also potentially gallstone formation. While sugar's relationship with gallstones isn't widely discussed, it is equally concerning.

* **Increase in Insulin Levels:** Like grains, excessive intake of sugars, significantly refined ones like white table sugar or high fructose corn syrup, causes rapid spikes in blood glucose, triggering an increased insulin secretion from the pancreas, resulting in higher circulating levels over time. This heightened level depletes bile, making one susceptible to forming stones within the gallbladder.
* **Promotes Weight Gain:** High consumption of sugars, particularly those found within processed foods, often leads to weight gain due to their empty calorie content devoid of any substantial nutrients yet packed full of energy (calories). Being overweight or obese increases the likelihood of developing cholelithiasis (gallstones).

**Tips To Minimize the Risk Of Gallstones Through Diet**

1. Avoid consuming excess carbohydrates straightforward carbs like sugary drinks, sweets, etc. Opt instead for low-carb foods rich in healthy fats to provide a steady energy supply without causing drastic fluctuations in your blood sugar and insulin levels.
2. Maintain a healthy weight through a nutritious low-carb diet like Healthy Keto. Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of cholesterol stones, the most common type of stone seen in patients suffering from this ailment. Losing even a small amount of weight, if overweight or obese, could potentially reduce the chances of getting affected by this painful condition.

## What are the distinctions between a yeast infection and a candida infection?

Yeast, a type of fungus, includes Candida, the most common yeast infection.

Types: Candida exists normally in our digestive system and body, part of the microbiome.

Locations: Includes vagina, mouth, under breasts, nail beds, armpits, and private parts.

Causes of Overgrowth: Antibiotics, sugar, steroids, stress, and estrogen contribute to pathogenic overgrowth.

Management:

1. Increase Stomach Acid: Use Betaine Hydrochloride or Apple Cider Vinegar.
2. Garlic Clove: Natural antifungal.
3. Probiotics: Help restore microbial balance.
4. Avoid Sugar: Crucial to managing yeast and Candida infections.

Consult a healthcare provider for tailored treatment and advice.

• Apple cider vinegar

• Fasting

***

## What are the early signs of insulin resistance?

Insulin resistance is a condition where your body's cells don't respond appropriately to the hormone insulin, which is crucial for regulating blood sugar levels.

When you consume carbohydrates, your body breaks them down into glucose, which enters your bloodstream.

In response, your pancreas releases insulin to help transport the glucose into your cells for energy or storage. However, when your cells become resistant to insulin, glucose can't enter them effectively, leading to high blood sugar levels.

#### **What Is Insulin Resistance?**

[Insulin resistance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/insulin-resistance-and-gluconeogenesis) occurs when your muscle, fat, and liver cells don't respond well to insulin, making it difficult for glucose to enter these cells.

As a result, your pancreas produces more insulin to compensate for the resistance, trying to maintain normal blood sugar levels.

Over time, if insulin resistance persists, your pancreas may not be able to keep up with the increased demand for insulin, leading to consistently high blood sugar levels and potentially progressing to prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.

#### **The Importance of Early Detection**

Recognizing the early signs of insulin resistance is crucial for preventing the development of more severe health issues.

By identifying insulin resistance in its early stages, you can take proactive steps to manage and potentially reverse the condition through lifestyle changes and targeted interventions.

Early detection and management of insulin resistance can help prevent the progression of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, reducing your risk of complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, and nerve damage.

## What are the early stages of asthma development?

### **Early Life Factors and Asthma Development**

A complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors influences the development of asthma.

Recent research has shed light on how various factors in early childhood, from exposure to bacteria to living in overly sanitized environments, can impact the likelihood of developing asthma later in life.

#### **The Role of Bacteria Exposure in Preventing Asthma**

Surprisingly, early exposure to certain bacteria may have a protective effect against asthma development.

Research tells us that kids who spend their childhoods in places brimming with different kinds of microbes—think farms or homes bustling with pets—are less likely to get asthma than those growing up in super clean spots.

This finding supports the hygiene hypothesis, which suggests that a lack of early childhood exposure to infectious agents and bacteria may lead to an increased risk of allergic diseases, including asthma.

#### **The Hygiene Hypothesis: Cleanliness and Asthma Risk**

The hygiene hypothesis proposes that living in overly clean and sanitized environments may disrupt the development of the immune system, leading to an increased risk of allergic diseases like asthma.

This theory is supported by observations that asthma prevalence is higher in developed countries with stricter hygiene standards.

But keep in mind that the hygiene hypothesis, while it offers a pretty convincing reason for why more people are getting asthma these days, isn't the only thing causing this uptick.

So, when it comes to what might kickstart asthma, our genes play a role, but so do the air we breathe and other things in our environment.

#### **Farm Living and Pet Ownership as Protective Factors**

Exposure to diverse pathogens through farm living or pet ownership has been associated with a decreased risk of asthma.

Research shows that kids who grow up around farms or have furry friends like dogs and cats at home tend to get asthma less often than those who don't.

The protective effect of farm living and pet ownership is thought to be mediated by exposure to a wide range of microbes, which helps to stimulate and regulate the developing immune system.

Getting up close and personal with these early microbes might be the superhero we need to ward off those pesky allergic reactions that often lead to asthma.

## What are the early stages of potassium deficiency?

In its early stages, a potassium deficiency, also known as mild hypokalemia, often manifests as subtle but noticeable changes in how you feel:

* [Muscle Cramps](https://www.drberg.com/blog/taking-electrolytes-yet-still-cramping): One of the initial and noticeable potassium deficiency symptoms is muscle cramping. Muscles rely on the proper balance of electrolytes, particularly potassium, to function smoothly. When blood potassium levels drop, your muscles may start to spasm or feel tight. If you've ever experienced a sudden, painful charley horse in your calf, you've felt a mild form of muscle cramping. These cramps can occur in various muscle groups, including your legs, arms, or even your abdomen.
* [Fatigue](https://www.drberg.com/blog/fatigued-on-keto-and-when-fasting): Potassium is crucial in energy production. It helps convert the food you eat into usable energy your cells can utilize. Low potassium disrupts this energy conversion process, often leaving you feeling drained and lethargic. This lack of energy might manifest as difficulty concentrating or simply feeling less motivated throughout the day.
* [Constipation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/constipation-is-not-just-a-lack-of-fiber): Ever notice how dehydration can back you up? Well, low potassium can have a similar effect on your digestive system. Potassium is involved in muscle contractions that help move food through your digestive tract. Low potassium levels can slow things down, leading to discomfort, bloating, and those dreaded irregular bowel movements we know as constipation.

## What are the effects of iron overload?

In the United States, many pastas, breads, and cereals go through a process of iron fortification.

A diet high in fortified grains can often lead to a very high iron intake. Too much iron can have negative implications on your health.

**Iron is attracted to damaged tissues of the brain, nerve, eye, liver, and heart. If you have insulin resistance or any issues with damaged tissues, iron targets these tissues and oxidizes them. It can also oxidize the fat layer around your brain and nervous system.**

Metals like iron accumulate in the body, and you don’t have the ability to remove them. Your body can only get rid of 1.2 mg of excess iron per day. Many iron supplements contain a copious amount of iron, but you only need 8 mg of iron per day to prevent a deficiency. All microbes need iron to survive—both good bacteria and pathogens need iron. Probiotics are incredibly efficient in regulating excess iron. The good bacteria in your gut utilizes excess iron in your body. **The best way to rid your body of excess iron is through a process called chelation—binding with a metal or mineral to remove it from the body.** Phytic acid is one of the best chelators. IP-6(inositol hexaphosphate) is a potent antioxidant that combines phytic acid and the B-vitamin inositol. IP-6 is an amazing chelator that inhibits the oxidative effects of iron. Dietary sources of phytic acid include vegetables, nuts, and seeds.

## What are the effects of long-term chronic stress on physical and mental health?

Cortisol, released during stress, facilitates coping mechanisms but prolonged elevation can lead to high blood sugars, muscle catabolism, heightened awareness, reduced inflammation, suppressed reproduction, decreased white blood cells, and increased infection risk. Chronic stress weakens cortisol, contributing to conditions like allergies, memory issues, autoimmune disorders, asthma, viral reactivation, insomnia, and abdominal fat accumulation.

To address underlying causes, support adrenal health with outdoor walking, vitamin D exposure, adrenal gland acupressure, and adequate intake of potassium, magnesium, and B-vitamins. Prioritizing quality sleep is essential for cortisol regulation and overall well-being.

## What are the effects of low magnesium epidemic?

A deficiency in magnesium could put you at risk for certain health concerns, such as:

• High blood pressure

• Arrhythmias

•Tetany or twitching

• Leg or foot cramps

• Fatigue

• Diabetes

• Insulin resistance

• Depression

• Inflammation

The RDAs for magnesium are 300 to 750 mg. But some people may need much higher amounts. It’s important to consume foods high in magnesium and avoid certain things that deplete magnesium. Foods rich in magnesium are the ones high in chlorophyll, which would be green vegetables. The top things that deplete magnesium are sugar and refined carbohydrates.

## What are the effects of Omega-6 fatty acids on liver health?

If you consume oils containing omega-6 fatty acids, they can create a lot of inflammation because these fats are highly inflammatory in your body. Avoiding these, while treating the liver, should help. You should avoid the foods containing these fats and substitute with foods high in omega-3 fats (anti-inflammatory).

**Remedies:**

* Avoid the following (contain omega-6)
* poultry
* nuts
* grains
* pumpkin seeds
* flax oil
* sunflower oil
* cottonseed oil
* safflower oil
* vegetable oil
* canola oil
* corn oil
* grain-fed dairy
* GMO oils

• Substitute with the following (contain omega-3):

* high-quality fish oil
* virgin cod liver oil
* sardines
* fish
* anchovies
* eggs
* grass-fed products

## What are the effects of vitamin D deficiency on dental health, and how can it impact tooth development, strength, and overall oral hygiene?

This mainly occurs when you’re a baby before your teeth even come in. It’s basically rickets of your teeth. Rickets is a vitamin D deficiency. I believe vitamin D is probably the most important vitamin, and it works with vitamin K2. Vitamin K2 is very important for your teeth as well.

**How a vitamin D deficiency can affect your teeth:**

1\. Enamel Hypoplasia (higher risk of cavities, white spots, pits/grooves, and sensitivity to cold/heat)

2\. Missing teeth

3\. Delayed teeth

**Symptoms of a vitamin D deficiency:**

• Low calcium

• Low back pain

• Inflammation

• Low immunity

• Loss of bone

## What are the effects of warfarin, and how can we correct blood viscosity naturally?

Warfarin, an anticoagulant that inhibits vitamin K1 to prevent clotting, is commonly prescribed for heart conditions like heart attacks and arrhythmias. However, it necessitates restrictions on vitamin K-rich foods such as leafy greens. Natural alternatives for blood thinning include garlic, known for its anticoagulant properties, fish oils rich in omega-3 fatty acids that reduce clotting, and vitamin E (tocotrienols), which also help to thin the blood. It's important to consult a healthcare provider before altering medications or diet plans. Newer anticoagulants allow for more flexibility in vitamin K intake, offering additional options for managing blood viscosity alongside medical guidance.

## What are the factors leading to glutathione deficiency?

#### **Factors Leading to Reduced Glutathione Levels**

There are many different factors that can contribute to low glutathione levels, including:

* Chronic stress
* Poor diet (low in precursor nutrients like glycine and cysteine)
* Environmental toxins and pollutants
* Certain medications (like acetaminophen and some antibiotics)
* Chronic infections and illness
* Genetic variations (like MTHFR mutations)
* Aging

Some lifestyle factors, like smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and lack of exercise, can also deplete glutathione levels over time.

The good news is that there are many ways to naturally boost glutathione production and recycling in the body, even if you have genetic variations or other risk factors.

## What are the factors that affect vitamin A absorption?

#### **Factors Affecting Vitamin A Absorption**

Several factors can impair the absorption of vitamin A, even when consuming adequate dietary sources. These include:

* Liver conditions: The liver plays a crucial role in storing and metabolizing vitamin A. Liver disorders can hinder vitamin A absorption and utilization.
* Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO): SIBO can interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin A, by disrupting the gut microbiome and causing inflammation.

## What are the foods that destroy kidneys?

Protect Your Priceless Kidneys: 7 Foods to Limit or Avoid

Your kidneys work tirelessly to filter toxins and waste from your blood. Safeguarding these vital organs is crucial for overall health. Unfortunately, several common foods can pose a threat to their well-being, potentially leading to serious complications.

* **Instant Noodles:** Beware of the preservative TBHQ often found in instant noodles, which can be toxic to your kidneys.
* **Foods High in Artificial Dyes:** Those vibrant colors in candies like Skittles come at a cost. The artificial dyes used can harm your kidneys.
* **Fried Chicken:** Indulging in fried chicken occasionally is fine, but frequent consumption can be problematic. The combination of high heat, seed oils, and breading can trigger glycation, a process that can clog your kidneys.
* **Commercial Bread:** Many commercial breads contain potassium bromate, a chemical linked to kidney cancer. Check ingredient lists and choose breads without this additive.
* **Soda:** Phosphoric acid in soda is harmful to your kidneys. Plus, the high sugar content contributes to diabetes, a leading cause of kidney damage.
* **Agave Syrup:** Don't be fooled by its "healthy" image. Agave syrup is high in fructose, which burdens your liver and kidneys.
*   **Cereals:** Cereals are often loaded with refined sugar, seed oil, and refined starch, none of which are kidney-friendly. Additionally, some cereals may contain traces of glyphosate, a concerning pesticide.

## What are the foods that you should avoid for Alzheimer's?

In my opinion, what you eat is the most important thing that influences dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. There is one food I believe you have to avoid if you’re trying to improve symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, and that is refined carbohydrates. Surprisingly, insulin is actually neuroprotective, and carbs increase insulin. If you’re deficient in insulin, your risk for amyloid plaquing goes up.

But this doesn’t mean you should consume more carbs. A high-carb diet is associated with high blood sugar, and people with high blood sugar or diabetes have an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. When your insulin is too high, your body starts protecting itself against excess insulin, leading to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a deficiency of insulin inside the cells. It's important to have just the right amount of insulin.

Refined carbs and sugar can also create brain inflammation. Not only that but sugar and refined carbs can destroy the energy sources for neurons and create oxidation and free-radical damage while also decreasing antioxidants.

This is why it’s key to fix insulin resistance. If you fix insulin resistance, the neurons can get the level of insulin they need for neuroprotection and to help decrease inflammation.

**How to support healthy insulin levels:**

1\. Get on the keto diet (run your body on ketones)

2\. Do intermittent fasting

3\. Do OMAD

4\. Consume nutrient-dense foods

5\. Decrease stress

## What are the hidden causes for sinus issues?

**Microorganisms in your pillow could be causing sinus pressure, nasal congestion, difficulty breathing, and snoring!** The average pillow has 7000 spores of 4 to 16 different types of fungus, especially if your pillow is made of synthetic material. The fungus found in your pillow is a frequent cause of rhinitis, or inflammation of the sinuses. The fungus feeds on nitrogen and dead skin—and can affect the respiratory system.

Fungus spores are activated by moisture, so your sweat, drool, and wet hair intensify the problem. Spores can even grow roots into the fibers of your pillow.

**Here are 4 signs that fungus in your pillow may be causing sinus congestion:**

1\. Discoloration on the pillow

2\. Moisture on the pillow

3\. Odors from the pillow

4\. Sudden change in mucus membranes (difficulty breathing, stuffy nose)

To solve this problem, wash your pillow at least once monthly and ensure it’s completely dried. It’s also essential to clean your pillowcase at least once per week. Your pillow won’t last forever, so be sure to replace it once yearly.

## What are the important components of immune response?

While your immune system has many components, a few key players are particularly important in mounting an effective defense against pathogens. Let's take a closer look at some of these immune system superstars.

#### **B-Cells and Antibody Production**

B-cells are a type of white blood cell that's crucial for producing antibodies. When a B-cell encounters a pathogen, it can differentiate into a plasma cell that churns out large quantities of antibodies specific to that invader.

These antibodies then circulate through the body, neutralizing the pathogen and tagging it for destruction by other immune cells.

Each B-cell produces a unique antibody that's tailored to a specific antigen (a substance that triggers an immune response). This allows the immune system to mount a targeted defense against a wide variety of threats.

#### **T-Helper Cells: The Conductors of Immunity**

T-helper cells, also known as CD4+ cells, are like the conductors of the immune system orchestra. They don't fight pathogens directly, but rather coordinate and direct other immune cells.

When a T-helper cell encounters a pathogen, it releases cytokines - chemical messengers that activate and guide other immune cells.

For example, T-helper cells can stimulate B-cells to produce antibodies, recruit macrophages to the site of an infection, and enhance the activity of killer T-cells.

#### **T-Regulatory Cells and Autoimmune Prevention**

T-regulatory cells, or Tregs, are like the peacekeepers of the immune system. Their job is to prevent autoimmune reactions by suppressing the activity of other immune cells that might mistakenly attack the body's own tissues.

Tregs use a variety of mechanisms to maintain immune tolerance, including releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines and directly inhibiting the activation of other T-cells.

When Treg function is impaired, it can lead to autoimmune disorders like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.

To sum it up: B-cells are the antibody factories, T-helper cells are the immune system's conductors, and T-regulatory cells are the peacekeepers that prevent friendly fire. Together, these specialized cells help orchestrate a precise and effective immune response.

## What are the initial signs and symptoms that may indicate the onset of dementia, and how can they manifest in daily life?

**They can be:**

1\. A loss of spatial navigation (like forgetting where you parked your car)

2\. Difficulty finding the right words

3\. Confusion

4\. Repeating yourself

The first thing you want to do if you are experiencing dementia symptoms is to start feeding your brain ketones. This will help bypass the degraded glucose absorption mechanism that is starving your brain of fuel and begin to feed the neurons directly.

**There are three ways you can increase your ketones:**

1\. Lower your carbs

2\. Do intermittent fasting

3\. Supply your body with healthy fats, like MCT oil and fatty fish

## What are the initial symptoms or warning signs that may indicate the onset of colon cancer?

Colon cancer risk factors include smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, an unhealthy diet, obesity, and H. pylori infection. While red meat was once associated with colon cancer, recent studies suggest quality (grass-fed vs. grain-fed) matters more than type. Genetics play a minor role compared to lifestyle factors like diet and exercise, which influence gene expression through epigenetics.

Early indicators of colon cancer include blood in the stool, unexplained anemia, thin stools, worsening constipation, abdominal pain, and sudden weight loss or loss of appetite. Consult a doctor if these symptoms arise.

**To potentially prevent colon cancer:**

1\. Limit antibiotics and supplement with probiotics when necessary.

2\. Consider intermittent or prolonged fasting to support colon health.

3\. Include cruciferous vegetables (kale, broccoli, cabbage) for anti-inflammatory and probiotic benefits.

4\. Stay physically active to enhance mitochondrial function and reduce cancer risk.

5\. Use anti-cancer spices like garlic, thyme, and sage in your diet.

6\. Avoid inflammatory foods such as gluten, grains, seed oils, and junk food.

These strategies can help promote colon health and reduce the risk of developing colon cancer.

## What are the main causes of gastritis, and how do these factors contribute to inflammation of the stomach lining?

Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach.

Typically, if someone has acidity, acid reflux, or heartburn, either betaine hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar might help. But these are not recommended if you have gastritis. With gastritis there is inflammation in the stomach, so if you add more acid you could make it worse.

An easy way to tell if you may have gastritis is to take apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride and see if you feel worse. If you get worse, you may either have gastritis or an ulcer. If you feel better, it may have been a lack of acid causing the problem in the first place.

**Potential causes of gastritis:**

* Alcohol
* Aspirin
* NSAIDS
* H. pylori
* Cortisol
* Bile

## What are the main causes of high androgen levels?

Excess androgens, male sex hormones present in both men and women, lead to symptoms like facial hair, hair loss, and PCOS in women, and hair loss and prostate issues in men.

**Causes and Remedies:**

1\. **Conversion to DHT:**

Enzymes convert testosterone to DHT, exacerbating symptoms:

\- Use spearmint tea, red reishi mushroom, licorice, green tea, black cohosh, chaste tree, and DIM supplements.

2\. **Estrogen Conversion Blockage:**

Glyphosate in non-organic foods inhibits enzyme activity:

\- Avoid GMOs and choose organic foods.

3\. **High Insulin:**

Refined carbs and sugar spike insulin, increasing androgens:

\- Avoid refined carbs, sugar, and snacking; follow Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting.

4\. **High Stress:**

Stress boosts adrenal androgen production:

\- Take vitamin B1, manage stress, improve sleep, and take walks.

\- Supplement with calcium, potassium, and magnesium.

\- Consider adrenal support supplements.

These steps help regulate androgen levels, alleviating associated symptoms and supporting overall health.

## What are the main causes of joint pain, and how do these factors affect overall joint health and mobility?

Here are some things Vitamin C is responsible for:

• It's involved with collagen synthesis

• It can help lower inflammation

• The need for vitamin C increases with stress (such as infection or surgery)

• Vitamin C is an antioxidant and a cofactor for opioids

• Vitamin C is required for collagen

• Vitamin C can't be absorbed in the presence of sugar

If you're consuming sugar, or you're prediabetic or diabetic, that elevated sugar situation could prevent vitamin C from being absorbed. Vitamin C and glucose have a similar chemistry. In the presence of vitamin C and glucose, your body will always absorb glucose before the vitamin C. Insulin resistance could also cause a person to be deficient in vitamin C. This could easily show up as joint pain.

## What are the main components of the nervous system?

The Nervous System is the part of a body that coordinates the voluntary (conscious) and involuntary (unconscious) actions of the body and sends signals between different parts of the body. It consists of two main parts, the central nervous system (CNS -- the brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS -- everything else apart from the brain and spinal cord).

**Central Nervous System (CNS)** CNS is the part of the nervous system that integrates the information that it receives from the environment, and coordinates the activity of, to all parts of the body. It consists of the brain and the spinal cord.

**Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)** PNS is the part of the nervous system consisting of the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. The main function of the PNS is to connect the central nervous system (CNS) to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a communication relay going back and forth between the brain and the extremities. The PNS consists of 2 parts: the somatic nervous system (controlling muscle) and the autonomic nervous system (controlling gland and organs).

**Somatic Nervous System (SNS)** This part of the PNS controls voluntary (conscious) control of body movements via muscles and skin.

**Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)** The ANS is the part of the peripheral nervous system (outside the brain and spinal cord) that acts as a control system, functioning mostly below the level of consciousness (involuntary or automatic), and controls visceral (organ and gland) functions. The ANS innervates every organ and gland in your body. The ANS affects heart rate, digestion, respiration rate, salivation, perspiration, the diameter of the pupils, urination, and sexual arousal.

## What are the most common factors and dietary habits that contribute to flatulence, and how do they affect digestive health?

**#1 Low stomach acidity:** Flatulence is hydrogen and methane gas created by microbes in the process of carbohydrate and fiber fermentation. Your stomach pH should be between 1 and 3—this is highly acidic. Without high stomach acidity, your digestive process is put under stress, causing many digestive issues.

The best remedies for low stomach acidity:

• Betaine hydrochloride

• Apple cider vinegar

**#2 Food intolerance:** Another cause of gas is food intolerance. Lactose intolerance is a common problem that happens when your body lacks the enzymes that break down lactose. In turn, this causes excess gas. You can avoid lactose or take enzymes that help break down lactose. Gluten intolerance is also common—if you’re on Healthy Keto®, you don’t have to worry about gluten or grains. Probiotics can help fortify your microbes and potentially increase enzyme production.

**#3 Gas-producing foods:** Avoid these common gas-producing foods:

• Fruit

• Beans

• Legumes

• Starches (like potatoes and rice)

• Sugar

• Certain cruciferous vegetables (Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage)

• Onions Instead, consume more:

• Lettuce

• Tomato

• Zucchini

• Olives

• Avocado

**#4 Sugar alcohols and fiber:** Keto-friendly low-calorie sweeteners, sugar alcohols, and fiber can cause digestive discomfort when consumed excessively. If you begin to experience gas, reduce your intake of these keto treats.

**#5 Chewing gum:** Chewing gum and chewing with your mouth open can cause you to swallow excess air. Avoid chewing with your mouth open.

**#6 Carbonated Soda:** Carbonated drinks can increase gas in your system, leading to flatulence.

## What are the most common sleep disorders?

While occasional sleepless nights are normal, chronic sleep disorders can have serious consequences for both mental and physical health. Two of the most common sleep disorders are insomnia and sleep apnea.

#### **Insomnia Symptoms and Risks**

Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. People with insomnia may wake up frequently throughout the night or early in the morning, leaving them feeling unrefreshed and tired during the day.

Symptoms of insomnia can include irritability, mood swings, and difficulty concentrating. Over time, chronic insomnia can lead to more serious mental health problems like anxiety and depression.

In fact, research has shown that people with insomnia are five times more likely to develop depression than those without the sleep disorder.

#### **The Hidden Dangers of Sleep Apnea**

[Sleep apnea](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-really-causes-sleep-apnea) is another common sleep disorder that can have serious consequences for physical health. Sleep apnea occurs when a person's breathing is repeatedly interrupted during sleep, often due to a blocked airway.

One of the most significant risks associated with sleep apnea is its impact on heart health. People with untreated sleep apnea are at a higher risk of developing high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.

In fact, research has shown that people with severe sleep apnea are two to three times more likely to have a heart attack or die from heart disease than those without the condition.

Sleep apnea can also lead to daytime fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and mood changes. If left untreated, it can even increase the risk of accidents and injuries due to excessive daytime sleepiness.

## What are the most effective methods for dissolving gallbladder stones and alleviating acid reflux symptoms?

To maintain gallbladder health and prevent stones, ensuring the correct ratio of bile salts to cholesterol is crucial. Supplementing with specific bile salts can help balance these ratios and potentially reduce stone severity. Additionally, TUDCA, another type of bile salt, can support bile flow and prevent sludge formation in the bile ducts. To enhance digestion and bile production, consider taking betaine hydrochloride to optimize stomach acid levels, which play a key role in stimulating bile release from the liver.

## What are the most effective natural remedies and interventions for managing depression?

Depression is a significant concern that affects many individuals. One potential natural remedy to consider is increasing your intake of vitamin D3. Research suggests that higher doses, such as 30,000 to 50,000 IU, taken once and then repeated every few days, may be beneficial. This is particularly relevant during the winter months when sun exposure is limited, often leading to seasonal mood changes.

In addition to vitamin D, spending time outdoors and connecting with nature can positively impact emotional well-being. It's also important to explore various factors that may contribute to depression, such as sleep quality and overall energy levels. A lack of energy is often correlated with depressive symptoms, and addressing physical health can have a significant effect on mood.

Furthermore, enhancing your gut health by incorporating probiotics and adjusting your diet to reduce carbohydrate intake may also help improve mood. By addressing these nutritional and lifestyle factors, you may find relief from depressive symptoms.

## What are the most effective natural strategies for managing and alleviating the symptoms associated with a hiatal hernia?

I think the hiatal hernia originally came from a weakness within some of the supporting connective tissue around in your abdomen. And so in that case there's a couple of things that I would look at. I would check your vitamin C because vitamin C deficiency can affect collagen support and strength of collagen itself and the fascia. And then also check the acid in the stomach because many people with hiatal hernia have a low stomach acid and they can't break down the amino acids. So you don't get the benefit of the complete amino acids into the tissues. Taking betaine hydrochloride, maybe five or six before you eat might just help you with that.

In the meantime, there's some great stretch type acupressure type treatments you can do for hiatal hernia. But you have to type in Dr. Berg hiatal hernia for many of the topics that you want to research, because unfortunately, they're ranking now more(22:49) medical sites than alternative sites.

## What are the most effective strategies for managing hypothyroidism?

To address hypothyroidism, particularly Hashimoto's, focus on managing the autoimmune aspect rather than just the thyroid itself. Selenium is crucial for converting thyroid hormones and should be prioritized over iodine. It's also essential to eliminate gluten from your diet, as it can exacerbate the condition by mimicking thyroid tissue, leading to increased autoimmune attacks and gut issues.

Remember, hypothyroidism is often a secondary issue stemming from an immune problem. Simply treating with thyroid hormones like Synthroid or T4 may not address the root cause. For effective management, ensure proper conversion of T4 to the active T3 hormone. For more in-depth guidance, explore detailed resources and videos on the topic.

## What are the most effective strategies for managing Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)?

Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) can severely impact daily life due to symptoms like dizziness upon standing. Here’s a professional approach to managing POTS:

1\. **Autonomic Nervous System Support**: POTS stems from dysfunction in the autonomic nervous system, involving sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways.

2\. **Role of Natural B1**: High doses of natural vitamin B1 (thiamine) are beneficial. Thiamine supports nerve function and may alleviate POTS symptoms over time.

3\. **Patience and Consistency**: Improvement may take weeks of consistent supplementation, especially if there is severe deficiency.

4\. **Consultation**: Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized guidance and to monitor progress effectively.

By addressing the root cause with natural B1 and supporting autonomic nervous system function, individuals with POTS can potentially experience relief and improved quality of life.

***

## What are the most effective strategies for reducing inflammatory markers in the body?

The first step I recommend is to eliminate all seed oils from your diet, including canola, soybean, and corn oils. These oils can contribute to inflammation. Additionally, it's important to assess your iron levels, as excessive iron intake can also lead to increased inflammation.

If you are not currently following a ketogenic diet, consider adopting it, as it may help reduce inflammation. Increasing your intake of vitamin D can be particularly beneficial in this regard. Some individuals find that niacin, along with niacinamide, can also aid in reducing inflammation, particularly at the cellular level, and may be worth incorporating into your regimen.

***

## What are the most effective strategies for reversing Type 2 diabetes?

To effectively reverse type 2 diabetes, focus on dietary changes aimed at reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake. By adopting a low-carb diet, you can improve insulin sensitivity, which helps lower blood glucose levels. This approach shifts your metabolism toward burning fat for energy, easing the strain on the pancreas and potentially reducing the need for medication over time. Monitoring your progress and working closely with healthcare providers are essential steps in managing and potentially reversing type 2 diabetes through dietary modifications.

***

## What are the most effective strategies for stress management?

1\. Increase your sleep - If you aren’t getting enough sleep at night, you’re not going to be able to be patient and stress-free throughout the day. Avoid blue light before bed and get 7-8 hours of quality sleep.

2\. Get plenty of vitamin B1 - Vitamin B1 directly affects your tolerance to stress. Get vitamin B1 from a natural source, like nutritional yeast.

3\. Lower your carbohydrates - A high-carb diet will cause significant blood sugar and insulin fluctuations, which can cause significant irritability and boost your stress.

4\. Avoid the news - The news can be overwhelmingly negative, and it can add unnecessary fear and stress to your life.

5\. Exercise - Exercise increases the oxygen in your blood and lowers your stress naturally. Long walks are especially good for lowering your stress levels.

6\. Magnesium - This mineral is great for lowering your stress levels. 7 cups of vegetables and a bottle of mineral water a day will give you plenty of magnesium.

7\. Vitamin D - Get plenty of sunlight or supplement vitamin D. Vitamin D helps reduce stress and anxiety as well as support healthy sleep.

8\. Ketones - Ketones elevate your mood and promote healthy stress levels. Get on keto and intermittent fasting.

9\. Change your environment - Get outside and enjoy nature. This can really help slow down your pace and get rid of stress.

**Causes:**

\- Chronic high insulin

\- Yo-yo dieting

\- Stress

\- Poor sleep

\- Over-training

\- Inflammation

**For those with metabolic inflexibility, maintaining low insulin is crucial.**

**Strategies:**

## What are the most effective treatments for acne?

Acne is often influenced by overactive sebaceous glands, exacerbated by hormonal spikes during puberty, particularly androgens. Managing acne involves ensuring adequate vitamin A, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D intake—benefits found in cod liver oil. Zinc supplementation also aids in regulating gland function. Avoiding seed oils and reducing sugar intake help mitigate insulin levels, which can indirectly elevate androgens associated with acne, notably in conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome. A low-carb diet may significantly improve symptoms.

***

## What are the most important signs of calcium deficiency?

While getting your blood calcium levels checked is a good starting point, this method doesn't tell the complete story.

That’s because standard tests measure total serum calcium, which includes both the free, usable calcium and calcium bound to protein, which your body cannot use efficiently.

To gain a more accurate understanding of your calcium status, ask your healthcare provider for an "ionized calcium" test.

This specific test looks at the amount of readily available, active calcium, painting a clearer picture of potential deficiencies. It can help tailor interventions, whether through diet or in some cases, supplementation to effectively address your needs.

#### **Common Signs That You Might Be Low in Calcium**

[Calcium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/calcium-goes-way-beyond-the-bones) is still vital for several bodily functions. Recognizing signs of deficiency can prompt timely intervention:

* Muscle Spasms or Twitches: Calcium plays a critical role in muscle function, so experiencing spasms, cramps, or twitches could signify a deficiency.
* Tetany: Characterized by involuntary muscle contractions, tetany, particularly in the eyelids or arms, can result from low calcium, although other mineral imbalances can also contribute. It highlights the delicate interplay of minerals in your body.
* Numbness or Tingling: Experiencing these sensations around your mouth or in your extremities could point toward a calcium dip. Calcium is crucial for nerve transmission, and these odd sensations could signal impaired nerve function.
* Heart Rate Fluctuations: Calcium contributes to regulating your heartbeat, so experiencing an erratic heart rate might stem from inadequate levels.
* Larynx Spasm: Affecting the vocal cords, low calcium can manifest as hoarseness, a change in your voice, or even a feeling of having a lump in your throat.

## What are the most nutritional deficiencies related to sciatica and carpal tunnel syndrome?

Vitamins B1, B6, and B12 are intimately involved in the nervous system and may be behind these painful conditions.

***

## What are the most reliable predictors of a heart attack?

Calcium and cholesterol act as band-aids to help repair the artery. But this is late on the chain of events after inflammation and after high insulin. High insulin starts this chain of events in place with the eventual hardening of your arteries, high blood pressure, and plaquing.

The coronary artery feeds the heart muscle blood and if this muscle does not get its oxygen, then it cramps and you get a heart attack. A simple test (CAC) costing under $100 and taking 2 seconds, can give you valuable feedback on your past lifestyle and score things for you. Reducing insulin with healthy ketosis and intermittent fasting is the first action to start with since high insulin triggered this problem in the first place.

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## What are the nighttime signs of diabetes?

### 15 Signs of High Blood Sugar That Can Affect Your Sleep

High blood sugar can disrupt your sleep in various ways. Here are 15 symptoms you might experience at night:

1. **Frequent Urination (Nocturia):** Your kidneys work overtime to remove excess sugar, leading to more nighttime bathroom trips.
2. **Excessive Thirst:** Sugar elimination through urine depletes electrolytes and causes dehydration, triggering increased thirst.
3. **Restless Legs Syndrome:** Sugar depletes vitamin B1, causing lactic acid buildup and lack of oxygen in the legs, leading to restless legs.
4. **Peripheral Neuropathy:** Burning, pain, or numbness in the feet due to nerve damage caused by high blood sugar.
5. **Cramps in Lower Legs and Feet:** Sugar imbalances lead to magnesium deficiency and calcium buildup, causing cramps.
6. **Excessive Sweating:** High blood sugar triggers a fight-or-flight response, leading to sweating, especially in the upper body.
7. **Sleep Apnea:** High insulin levels can contribute to sleep apnea, disrupting breathing during sleep.
8. **Hypoglycemia:** The body overcompensates for high blood sugar with insulin, leading to low blood sugar episodes at night.
9. **Delayed Sleep:** High sugar levels interfere with melatonin release, making it harder to fall asleep.
10. **Gastric Reflux (GERD):** High blood sugar affects the valve controlling stomach acid, leading to nighttime heartburn.
11. **Nightmares/Vivid Dreams:** Vitamin B1 deficiency, linked to high blood sugar, disrupts neurotransmitters and can cause vivid dreams.
12. **High Blood Pressure:** Blood pressure doesn't dip normally during sleep in people with diabetes, potentially causing nighttime hypertension.
13. **Heart Palpitations:** Electrolyte imbalances due to high blood sugar can lead to heart palpitations at night.
14. **Teeth Grinding:** Stress response triggered by high blood sugar can cause nighttime teeth grinding.
15. **Headache Upon Waking:** Dehydration from high blood sugar can result in morning headaches.

If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to talk to your doctor about managing your blood sugar levels. Remember, maintaining healthy blood sugar is crucial for overall health and restful sleep.

## What are the non-infectious causes of fatty liver disease?

Fever can arise from various non-infectious causes beyond microbial infections, necessitating careful consideration and differential diagnosis. These include autoimmune conditions, trauma, inflammatory disorders, sudden shock, medication reactions like antibiotics, neurological events such as stroke or brain tumors, respiratory conditions like ARDS triggered by chemicals, allergies, pancreatitis, gallstones, kidney stones, thyroid storms, and gout. It's crucial to identify the underlying cause accurately to guide appropriate treatment and management strategies.

## What are the non-stress causes of high cortisol levels?

It's basically insulin resistance because insulin is increased by a factor of 5-7x making the cells reject this excess. This forces cortisol to come in and bypass things "initially" and dismantle the cell structures, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and other body proteins. These proteins are converted to glucose. So insulin causes an increase in cortisol.

## What are the possible causes of an irregular heartbeat?

An irregular heartbeat can take many forms: slow heart rates, fast heart rates or skipped heartbeats. These are often known as arrhythmias (if they are persistent) or palpitations (if they are not chronic but happen from time to time).

**Cause #1: Gallbladder issues**

Gallstones, bile sludge, and bile duct blockages can cause heart palpitations. Based on an interesting study it was revealed that because of overload and inflammation in the gallbladder, certain signals through your body alter your healthy heart function. One of the best ways to fix this is to reduce the load of the gallbladder by doing intermittent fasting. It will reduce the load on your digestive system.

**Cause #2: Low electrolytes**

Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that allow the muscles to contract and relax and the nerves to transmit communications throughout the nervous system. The heart is made up of muscle tissue, so if your electrolytes are low you can develop palpitations.

**Cause #3: Alkalosis**

The pH of your blood is important for healthy heart function. If your pH is too high (alkaline), then you can develop a heart arrhythmia. Improving your pH will also increase the absorption of electrolytes in your body, which should normalize your heartbeat. The good thing is that it can be fixed very easily.

**Cause #4: Insulin resistance**

One of the insulin functions is to allow your cells to absorb electrolytes. When you are on a high-carb diet you can develop insulin resistance. This happens because high carbs increase the production of insulin in order to lower the blood sugar. When this occurs too often, your cells will not tolerate high insulin amounts anymore, and therefore become resistant to it. As a result, your cells absorb lesser amounts of electrolytes. The result can be irregular heartbeat.

## What are the possible causes of dark circles under a child's eyes?

**It has to do with an iron deficiency. It does not mean that the child has anemia, but they may have anemia. Iron is involved in different chemical pathways and enzymes.**

**Iron deficiency symptoms**

• Fatigue

• Dizziness

• Pale

• Irritable

• Ice cravings

• Delayed growth

**Children should not take iron supplements from a drug store for dark circles under the eyes. Always do food-based iron, a food-based complex, or just the food. The child should also be consuming vegetables because when someone has an iron deficiency, they probably have other deficiencies.**

***

## What are the possible causes of nail problems?

Typically, your urine should be a straw yellow color. If it is different it may have different causes under different colors of it.

Horizontal ridges / Too-white nails / Too-blue nails

This could happen from vitamin B1 deficiency. Additionally if your nails are too white, it could come from the same cause. Avoiding refined carbohydrates, consuming benfotiamine (fat- soluble vitamin B1) as well as nutritional yeast should help.

Brittle nails

Brittle nails can happen due to the deficiency of biotin (vitamin H) and folate. Consuming too much refined foods as well as egg whites only can cause its deficiency. Consuming probiotics and fermented foods should help. One good source of biotin is nutritional yeast. You can get folate as a supplement as well.

White little spots on the nail

If you see a white spec in the middle of the nail it means 3 months ago you had zinc deficiency that created it. The reason behind this timing is because your nails take 6 months to fully grow. Therefore, you can trace it this way. Too much sugar and refined carbs can cause zinc deficiency.

Additionally, if you have horizontal white lines this can come from low calcium or vitamin B3 deficiency.

Too-brown / too-gray nails or pink strips on top of the nails

This is a symptom of B12 deficiency. B12 mainly comes from animal products so if you are vegan it can potentially create B12 Deficiency. Consuming animal products / B12 supplements as well as increasing stomach acidity should help.

Vertical ridges on the nails

This is a symptom of thyroid problem as well as vitamin B12 and iron deficiency. Consuming Organic sea kelp should help with that in addition to nutritional yeast.

Clubbed nails This could potentially come from liver or kidney problems. Yellowish discoloration on your nail This is a symptom of fungus on your nails. Consuming biotin should help with that.

## What are the possible causes of red spots on the skin?

**There are two primary underlying causes of having red spots on your skin:**

1\. Diet - You need to consume healthy nutrients to get all of your vitamins. It is especially important that you have 7-10 cups of vegetables per day.

2\. Malabsorption - If you can’t absorb your nutrients, you can develop deficiencies even if you consume the right foods. Probiotics and bile salts may help improve digestion and absorption.

**The best sources of vitamin K1 are:**

• Kale

• Spinach

• Collard greens

• Dark leafy greens

**The best sources of vitamin C are:**

• Sauerkraut

• Bell pepper

• Berries

• Lemon

## What are the possible dangers of consumption of trans fats?

Consuming trans fats increases the risk of several serious health issues, including:

• Heart attack

• Stroke

• Type 2 diabetes

• Cancer

• Increased LDL

• Decreased HDL

• Inflammation

• Autoimmune diseases

• Infertility

• Tendon and bone degeneration

***

## What are the possible reasons for excessive thirst?

Increased thirst is a condition where you are more thirsty than normally. It usually happens with frequent urination. This can create a problem as you can lose your electrolytes fast.

**Cause #1: Diabetes / insulin resistance**

If you have insulin resistance or diabetes either can cause excessive thirst. This is because water follows blood sugar. Having these conditions you lose your water fast and the loss signals to your brain, causing you to want to drink more water.

**Cause #2: Potassium/Sodium imbalance**

Having a balanced ratio of sodium-potassium is needed for proper hydration in the body. Normally the ratio should be about 4,700 mg of potassium to 1,000 mg of sodium per day, a 4.7 to 1 ratio. If you have high amounts of sodium, this can create potassium deficiency symptoms; and it applies the opposite way too.

**Cause #4: Too much calcium**

When you consume too much calcium or you have too much calcium in the body this is the condition called hypercalcemia. One of its side effects is frequent urination and excessive thirst.

**Cause #5: Certain drugs and medicines**

If you consume certain drugs, psych drugs, diuretics or even steroids they can cause your body to lose fluid or you may have excessive thirst as one of their side effects.

***

## What are the possible reasons for insufficient muscle growth?

Lack of muscle growth can have several underlying reasons; however it has simple and effective remedies.

**Cause #1: Lack of workout intensity**

To be able to have muscle growth you have to do higher weights and lower reps. This is because your muscle tissues need to be damaged from the exercise for your body to heal them and make them bigger. Make sure your technique is correct to avoid injuries and gradually increase the intensity.

**Remedies:**

* Hire a personal trainer to help you with the workouts and technique
* Put enough weights so you can barely do 5 to 7 reps (make sure you gradually increase the weights)
* Do more compound exercises that affect several muscles:

deadlifts

squats

overhead push

power clean

**Cause #2: Lack of recovery**

Your muscles grow when you sleep. This is because after the exercises your body has to heal the damaged muscle tissues and grow them. If you have high-intensity exercises and you eat correctly but don’t recover this can definitely cause inability to gain muscle mass. The best way is to improve your recovery.

Additionally, if you undergo high amounts of stress, this will cause your body to produce too much cortisol (stress-regulating hormone). Cortisol could break down your muscle tissues and turn them into blood sugar.

**Remedies:**

* Sleep 8 to 9 hrs per day (take naps if needed)
* Let your muscles recover fully before training the same muscles again
* Consume potassium (4,700 mg / day)
* Consume more vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast

• benfotiamine

* Avoid things and people that stress you out
* Take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes).

**Cause #3: Low amounts of human growth hormone and testosterone**

There are two main hormones that help us grow and retain muscles. These are testosterone and human growth hormone. If you lack these hormones it can result in muscle loss and inability to grow it.

Human growth hormone (HGH) is an anti-aging hormone. It burns fat as well as building muscles and regenerating the body. The best way to increase HGH is to do intermittent fasting and high-intensity full body training.

Testosterone is a male hormone that is also needed for women in smaller amounts. Having normal amounts of testosterone in addition to exercises can build your muscles. One way to improve testosterone is by avoiding things that cause it to go low.

**Remedies:**

* Increase human growth hormone by doing these things:
  * do intermittent fasting
  * consume 7 to 8 oz of protein per meal
  * improve sleep
* Increase testosterone by doing the following:
  * consume more cholesterol (helps to make testosterone)
  * consume moderate amounts of protein (6 to 8 oz in meal)
  * consume zinc (100 mg / day)
* consume korean red ginseng
* take L-arginine
* take D-aspartic acid
* consume cruciferous vegetables (natural estrogen blockers)
* consume DIM (concentrated cruciferous)
* consume white button mushrooms
* consume mushrooms in general
* consume celery
* consume parsley
* consume olive oil

**Cause #4: Insulin resistance**

Consuming a lot of refined carbs and sugars will spike your insulin high in order to lower the blood sugar level that results. Eventually your cells become resistant to insulin. The connection between insulin resistance and lack of muscle growth requires an understanding of insulin.

Insulin acts like a key to the cells, allowing them to absorb vital nutrients. If your cells are resistant to insulin they don’t absorb protein well, causing slow muscle growth or inability to grow muscle.

If you do the Healthy Keto® diet as well as an intermittent fasting plan your body cells will be less resistant to insulin--allowing them to absorb more protein and therefore grow more muscle mass.

**Other causes:**

* Avoid snacking (spikes insulin)
* Avoid refined carbs and sugar
* Do the Healthy Keto® diet
* Do intermittent fasting
* Keep your carbs under 50 g/day
*   Consume moderate amounts of protein (6 to 8 oz per meal)

## What are the potential causes and contributing factors of interstitial cystitis?

Interstitial cystitis is a condition where there is some kind of inflammation in your bladder that creates a lot of discomfort. This can be resolved by following a healthy diet and lifestyle.

Symptoms:

* Painful bladder
* Urgency to urinate
* Painful urination

Getting your body healthy

This condition has an unknown cause. And there is no officially stated remedy for it. However, I believe that if you become more healthy overall, this condition should resolve.

**Potential Cause #1: Low estrogen**

If you have low estrogen it can cause bladder issues. This is because estrogen itself influences the sensation of urination in your bladder. Low estrogen can be caused by menopause or some kind of issue with the ovaries.

**Potential Cause #2: obstruction (due to fibroids or enlarged prostate)**

If you can’t empty your bowels there could be some obstruction or blockage in the bladder; it could be a fibroid (scar tissue) or caused by an enlarged prostate.

**Potential Cause #3: ANS dysfunction**

The ANS, or autonomic nervous system, has to do with your general body response during periods of stress. It also relaxes your body and many of its organs during a rest period. ANS affects your bladder function and nerves. If you have dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, you may have bladder problems including urine retention.

**It’s a vitamin B12 deficiency. Of course, the question is, how do you become B12 deficient? There are several primary causes, including:**

1\. Low stomach acid

2\. Gastric bypass surgery

3\. A problem in your intestines such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or Crohn’s disease

4\. Being a vegan, because B12 mostly comes from eggs, meats and organs, and dairy. If you’re vegan, add B12 in the natural form called methylcobalamin

5\. Alcohol, which is why alcoholics are often B12 deficient. In fact, anyone with liver damage will have difficulty absorbing B12

Now you can find out what’s causing your burning tongue!

## What are the potential causes of a heavy menstrual cycle?

A heavy period can cause a lot of discomfort during that time of the month. It’s a hormonal problem. Let’s look at the common remedies for this.

**Cause #1: Estrogen dominance**

Too much estrogen can cause a lot of problems during the period, including cramping, long periods and other period-related issues. We need estrogen for normal functioning of the body, but if there’s too much you can get heavy periods and have other issues. Many people already have high estrogen due to the number of foods that contain chemicals that mimic estrogen.

## What are the potential causes of a lump-in-the-throat sensation?

You may have a sensation that something is in your throat when there is nothing in there. This means there is something wrong in your inner throat muscles or the valves in it.

**Symptoms:**

* Spasms in the throat
* Can’t breathe
* Sensation of a lump in the throat

**Cause #1: Hypocalcemia (calcium deficiency)**

Calcium is very important in preventing throat spasms as well as general spasms in the body. If you lack calcium, as well as VItamin D and K2 (which support absorption and utilization of free calcium in your body) this can result in throat “lumps.”

**Remedies:**

* Take calcium lactate
* Take calcium orotate
* Avoid calcium carbonate
* Take vitamins D and K2

**Cause #2: Low stomach acidity**

If you have low stomach acidity, this can result in acid reflux, which means the valve that keeps the acid in your stomach isn’t strong enough and the stomach will push the acid to your throat. This can cause throat spasms and the feeling of a lump in your throat. Additionally if your stomach acidity is not enough, you will not be able to absorb the calcium that is in your diet.

**Remedies:**

* Take apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water)
* Take betaine hydrochloride

**Cause #3: Stress**

Stress over a long period of time can result in the depletion of calcium in the body. The nerves in your throat can get irritated as a result. All you need to know is that if your nervous system is worn out due to a lot of stress, it can result in throat spasms and a feeling like there’s a lump in there.

**Remedies:**

* On an immediate basis--try to slow down your breathing
* Take vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

* Get quality sleep (take naps if needed)
* Take long walks outside daily
* Avoid things/people that stress you out
* You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support
* You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Other causes:**

* Viral infection
* Vitamin D deficiency
* GERD (apply the remedies from cause #2)
* Problem with a vagus nerve

## What are the potential causes of a swollen belly and bloating that worsen throughout the day?

There are 2 reasons, one being insulin resistance and the second, being low cortisol. Insulin resistance is a state whereby there are higher amounts of insulin in the body, which is highly inflammatory.

The second problem is low cortisol because cortisol created from the adrenal is anti-inflammatory and if you do not have this hormone in the correct quantity, then stress throughout the day will cause inflammation and swell the belly. If you wake up and your stomach is small and go to bed and your belly is big. So if your belly swells and gets bigger and bloated through the day, then fix insulin resistance and maybe even low cortisol.

## What are the potential causes of abdominal pain radiating to the back?

There are different situations that can happen—you may experience abdominal pain on the right side, left side, or center that can refer pain to the lower back or even up in the upper back or your shoulders.

If the pain is going to the right side, it’s usually more liver-related. This can happen because of a problem with the gallbladder, bile duct, or liver. It could be a gallstone or a blockage.

On the left side or center, you are likely looking at a pancreas-related situation. It could be a situation called pancreatitis.

**Symptoms of this include:**

1\. Upper abdominal pain

2\. Upper abdominal pain that radiates

3\. Upper abdominal pain that worsens after eating

4\. Nausea

5\. Tenderness

6\. Bloating

## What are the potential causes of abnormal urine color?

Typically, your urine should be a straw yellow color. If it is different, various causes can underlie those unusual colors.

**Dark urine:**

Dark urine could mean that the urine is too concentrated. This could indicate that you need to drink more water.

**Clear urine:**

This probably means it’s too diluted, which could mean you’re consuming too much water. You could actually be diluting your electrolytes, weakening the heart.

**Bright yellow urine:**

This could happen after consuming too many synthetic B vitamins. Reduce the amounts or substitute with natural B vitamins in this case.

**Red/Rust urine:**

Dark red could indicate blood in the urine, kidney stones, UTI or prostate problems. Also intense running can cause it by moving your kidney up and down for a long time, causing it to have hard time to properly filter the blood.

**Dark orange or brown urine:**

This could point to liver/gallbladder issues. Potentially it could come from flagyl (an antibiotic), muscle injury, excessive exercise, kidney damage, excessive fava beans or eating rhubarb. Consuming more vegetables may help.

**Pink urine:**

This could happen after eating beets or come from a small amount of blood in the urine. Potassium citrate may help.

**Green urine:**

This could come from eating asparagus.

**Foamy urine:**

This could mean there is too much protein in the urine. It can happen from consuming too much protein, or you may need to support your kidneys.

**Blue urine:**

This could mean there is too much calcium in your body. It can come from consuming a lot of vitamin D. Too much intake of B vitamins can also cause it. Consuming vitamin K2 and reducing amounts of calcium should help.

**Black urine:**

If your urine is black, the cause could be an antibiotic called flagyl or it could be the herb cascara laxative or the sweetener sorbitol.

## What are the potential causes of charley horses?

A muscle cramp or charley horse is an uncontrolled muscle contraction that is sudden and painful. It often occurs during exercise or at night. Muscle cramps commonly occur in the calf muscle, but they can also occur in the foot and, occasionally, in the thigh.

**Cause #1: Magnesium and potassium deficiency (electrolytes)**

Magnesium and potassium are the electrolytes (electrically charged minerals) that are very important for correct muscle work and relaxation.

Magnesium is the relaxation mineral. Having enough of it will prevent cramps from occurring as your muscles will be naturally relaxed.

Potassium is responsible for high cellular energy as well as relaxation of the body in general-- along with many other functions. Your body needs 4,700 mg of potassium daily, which is about 7 to 10 cups of vegetables a day.

**Remedies:**

* Consume magnesium-rich foods
* Consume vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)
* Consume magnesium and potassium supplements
* Take apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water) to improve the absorption of calcium and magnesium

**Cause #2: Too much calcium**

Too much calcium in the diet can cause a lot of calcium residue in your muscle tissues as well as in your joints. Calcium does cause contraction of the muscles, and if you have an excess of it, it can cause cramps. Additionally, sometimes you may consume moderate amounts of calcium and still get cramps; this could be because calcium is not absorbed properly and not mobilised to the bones once it is absorbed. In this case you can take vitamin D and K2.

**Remedies:**

* Avoid calcium carbonate
* Consume vitamin D3 and K2
* Consume natural sources of calcium (like european cheese, kefir, etc.)

**Cause #3: Alkalosis**

If you have too alkaline a body pH it can result in muscle cramps. The reason behind it is that when your body pH is higher than normal it can result in inability to utilize the free calcium that is in your body. Calcium, in the right amounts and correctly utilized by your body, is needed for healthy muscle contractions. The solution would be to acidify your body.

**Remedies:**

* Take apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water, with your meals)
* Take betaine hydrochloride
* You can also drink these acidifiers:
  * kombucha tea
  * pickle juice
* Take potassium
* Avoid antacids
* Do the Healthy Keto® diet
* Do an intermittent fasting plan
* Avoid tap water (use a filter if needed)

**Other causes:**

* Medication for high blood pressure
* Medication for high cholesterol
*   Prednisone

Chronic pain can stem from various causes, each requiring targeted remedies:

1\. **Old Injury or Surgery:**

\- **Cause:** Scar tissue from past surgeries or injuries.

\- **Remedies:** Acupressure on opposite sides, intermittent fasting, periodic prolonged fasting, and stinging nettle root.

2\. **Autoimmune Condition:**

\- **Cause:** Immune system attacking healthy cells, leading to inflammation and pain.

\- **Remedies:** Vitamin D supplementation, intermittent fasting, periodic prolonged fasting.

3\. **Frequent Eating and Refined Carbs:**

\- **Cause:** Damaged capillaries and insulin spikes from carb intake.

\- **Remedies:** Avoid refined carbs and sugar, intermittent fasting, Healthy Keto® diet, and benfotiamine (fat-soluble vitamin B1).

4\. **Referred Pain:**

\- **Cause:** Pain felt in one part of the body due to issues in another part.

\- **Remedies:** Address specific organ-related pain (e.g., pancreas, spleen, heart, gallbladder/liver, ovary, prostate, kidney) with targeted treatments like acupressure, adjustments, and appropriate dietary adjustments.

These strategies aim to alleviate chronic pain by addressing its root causes effectively and promoting overall wellness.

## What are the potential causes of darkened spots on the skin, and how do factors like sun exposure?

The medical term for darkened skin spots is melasma. This happens when an overactive melanocyte is making too much melanin. Melanin is a pigment.

**3 main causes of darkened skin spots:**

1\. High levels of insulin or insulin resistance

2\. High levels of estrogen

3\. Stress (high cortisol)

When it comes to remedies for darkened skin spots, it’s important to identify what’s causing the issue.

**What you could do for darkened skin spots:**

• Stress (cause) — Take B vitamins and vitamin D3

***

## What are the potential causes of dry skin, and what effective strategies and treatments can be employed to alleviate this condition?

Dry, cracked, or scaly skin can cause a lot of irritation. Although harsh chemicals can cause skin dryness, the most common dietary cause is low levels of omega-3 fatty acid.

**Cause #1: Lack of alpha-linolenic acid:**

Alpha-linolenic acid is mainly involved in building and making the structure of your body cells. It is crucial for providing moisture to the skin and reducing inflammation.

**Cause #2: Lack of bile**

If you eat the above foods and your dry skin condition doesn’t resolve, it could mean that these acids are not digested well. Particularly, lack of bile can cause an inability to digest and absorb alpha-linolenic acid from food. This can be due to a removed gallbladder or liver/gallbladder- related problems.

## What are the potential causes of elevated creatinine levels in the blood?

Creatinine is a waste product of creatine in your body. Creatine is a protein compound that supports your muscle and brain metabolism. Normally, your body gets rid of creatinine through your urine. However, if it’s backing up in your blood, there could be different causes.

**Symptoms:**

* Nausea
* Chest pain
* Muscle cramps
* Vomiting
* Fatigue
* Changes in urination frequency and appearance
* High blood pressure
* Swelling or fluid retention
* Itchiness

**Cause #1: Too much protein in your diet**

If you consume too much protein in your diet, and/or consume a lot of cooked meat, this can cause high levels creatinine in the blood.

**Cause #2: Intense exercise**

Intense exercise can cause high blood creatinine as well. This is because creatinine will be produced by your muscle as a result of protein metabolism.

**Cause #3: Inflammation/injury**

An inflammatory condition, whether from an injury or not, is another reason for high creatinine in your blood. Consuming vitamin D and doing intermittent fasting should help.

**Cause #4: Consuming creatine supplement**

Many people use creatine supplements to support their workouts and energy levels. If you consume too much creatine, it can cause high creatinine levels in your blood.

**Cause #5: Kidney problems**

If you have kidney damage, this could create high creatinine levels in the blood. If that’s the case, the solution would be to support your kidneys.

**Cause #6: Gallbladder/liver problems**

The gallbladder is very important for your digestive system. If none of the above causes relate to your condition, it could come from the gallbladder.

## What are the potential causes of frequent vomiting?

Nausea is discomfort and uneasiness that makes you want to throw up or vomit. Usually it’s a one-time event linked to something that doesn’t settle right in the stomach. Most of the time, vomiting is harmless, but if it’s recurring, it can be a sign of a more serious illness.

**Cause #1: Gallbladder problems / bile duct**

The gallbladder is a very important organ for your body as it stores bile. Bile is very important for our digestion and breakdown of fats. If you take something that your digestive system is not used to, this can overload your gallbladder ducts and cause confusion in your stomach. As a result you can feel nauseous.

**Remedies:**

* Take ginger (in a tea or supplement)
* Take peppermint (in a tea or supplement)
* Take cayenne pepper (in a supplement)
* Take chamomile tea
* Take meadowsweet tea

To avoid feeling nauseous in the future, do the following:

* Ask yourself: when did the nausea start?
* Ask yourself: what did you eat before that?
* Avoid that food if it’s unhealthy
* If it’s a healthy food, decrease it

**Other causes:**

* Motion sickness
* Food poisoning
* Chemotherapy
* Low blood sugar
* Medications/drugs
* Kidney stones
*   Pregnancy

## What are the potential causes of increased gas production, and how do dietary choices, digestive health, and lifestyle factors contribute to this condition?

Increased passing of gas can go together with bloating, digestive issues many other discomforts in daily life. Let’s look at the common causes and remedies for it.

**Cause #1: SIBO / Excess fermentation in the intestines**

SIBO stands for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. It’s a condition where a good portion of your friendly bacteria is in the wrong place--it’s in the small intestine instead of mostly in the large intestine where it should be. If you have SIBO you may have a lot of bloating, abdominal pain, passing of gas etc. This is because food starts to ferment in the wrong place which releases different types of gases in the colon.

You can get a hydrogen/methane breath test kit. The test is inexpensive but you may need a prescription to buy one. The test will confirm whether or not you have SIBO.

## What are the potential causes of itchy and red eyes?

Having itchy, red eyes can create a number of difficulties in our daily lives. This condition can come from infections and allergies as well as nutritional deficiencies.

**Cause #1: Viral infection**

If you have an eye infection like pink eye, it can cause eye irritation, redness and inflammation. I suggest using colloidal silver as well as zinc and vitamin D to improve your immune system.

**Remedies:**

* Use 1 drop of colloidal silver in each eye 7 times per day
* Consume zinc
* Consume garlic
* Consume other natural antibiotics

Consume vitamin D

**Cause #2: Nutritional deficiencies**

There are several nutrients that your body needs for healthy functioning of the eyes. If you are deficient in them, this can create redness and irritation in the eyes.

-If you are deficient in vitamin A, it can cause you to have dry eyes as well as a thickened mucus around the eyes that can result in itchiness and redness.

-B vitamin deficiencies can cause redness or irritation in the eyes, especially B1 and B2 deficiencies.

-Vitamin C helps keep veins and capillaries healthy and supports their work. If you have a small hemorrhage (bleeding) in the eye, vitamin C (along with vitamin K) can help repair it.

-Vitamin D is one of the best nutritional anti-inflammatories; if you have red, irritated eyes, vitamin D can help resolve this condition.

**Remedies: Vitamin A:**

* Beef liver
* Egg yolks
* Cod liver oil
* Fatty fish
* Butter
*   Cheese

    **B vitamins:**
* Nutritional yeast
* Eggs
* Meat
* Liver
* Fish
* Nuts
*   Seeds

    **Vitamin C:**
* Sauerkraut
* Bell pepper
* Berries
*   Raw lemons

    **Vitamin K:**
*   Any type of dark leafy green

    **Vitamin D3:**
* Consume cod liver oil
* Get more exposure to the sun
*   Take a vitamin D3 supplement

    **Improve the absorption of vitamins:**
* Consume apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water)
* Consume betaine hydrochloride

• Take purified bile salts

**Cause #3: Allergies**

An allergy is an intolerance to certain foods or some substance in the environment (like pollen). If you have red, itchy eyes, there is a possibility that you have an allergy and your eyes are reacting to certain substances or food.

**Remedies:**

* Consume vitamin A
* Consume vitamin D
*   Locate the source of the allergy by looking back and seeing what you were exposed to or what you ate before the eye irritation started, then avoid it.

    **Cause #4: High-carb diet**

    When you are on a high-carb diet your blood sugars elevate too high after eating. As a result your tear glands can stop producing tears. Insulin can also affect the blood flow to the nerve that goes to the cornea. Additionally, if you feel that there is something in the eye but nothing is in there, this is a sign of a blood sugar / insulin problem.

    **Remedies:**
* Avoid sugar and refined carbs
* Avoid snacking
* Do the Healthy Keto® diet
*   Do an intermittent fasting plan

    **Other causes:**
* Blue lights causing irritation
* Lack of sleep
* Low blood sugar
* Anemia
* Lack of essential pancreatic enzymes
* Liver/gallbladder problem
* Alcohol
* IBS

## What are the potential causes of joint pain?

Joint pain is a problem that can be resolved by nutrition and proper diet. Certain foods and nutrients can reduce the inflammation and speed the recovery process of your joints and bones.

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiencies**

When you are lacking certain vitamins in your body it can cause a lot of joint pain. This is because these certain vitamins are required for the healthy functioning of your joints and body tissues.

**Vitamin D3** is one of the most powerful natural anti-inflammatory vitamins. It will help with joint pain and reduce inflammation.

**Vitamin K2** is a vital nutrient that helps to move excess calcium deposits from your joints into your bones.

**Vitamin C** helps to develop and repair bones and joints in your body by making collagen (proteins for bones and joints). If you have fatigue in addition to joint pain that’s a good indicator of vitamin C deficiency.

Colostrum is a great anti-inflammatory and a good supplement for joint pain.

**Vitamin D3 (get 20,000 to 40,000 IU daily):**

* Consume cod liver oil
* Get more exposure to the sun
* Take a vitamin D3 supplement

**Vitamin K2** (get 300 to 400 mcg daily):

* Consume vitamin K2-rich foods:
  * grass-fed milk
  * cheese
  * butter
  * goose liver
  * grass-fed organic egg yolks
* Get vitamin K2 supplement (MK-7 version)

**Vitamin C:**

* Consume vitamin C-rich foods:
  * sauerkraut
  * bell pepper
  * berries
  * raw lemons
* Take natural vitamin C complex (not ascorbic acid)
* Avoid refined carbs and sugar
* Avoid snacking
* Consume colostrum for joint pain

**Cause #2: Mycotoxins**

Mycotoxins are various poisons which are released from mold and fungus that can affect your joints and your immune system in a bad way. One thing to know is that consuming refined carbs and sugar will worsen the problem as mold and fungus live on sugar and carbs.

**Remedies:**

* If you have mold in your house, locate and get rid of it
* Avoid antibiotics
* Avoid GMO foods
* Avoid sweets and carbs
* Consume grapefruit seed oil
* Consume bentonite clay
* Consume garlic
* Do the Healthy Keto® diet
* Do an intermittent fasting plan

**Cause #3: Omega-6 fatty acids**

When you consume certain oils that contain omega-6 fatty acids, they can greatly spike the inflammation in your body and this alone can cause you to have joint pain. The solution would be to avoid foods with omega-6 fatty acids and to consume more foods with omega-3 fatty acids (these are anti-inflammatory).

**Remedies:**

* Avoid foods containing omega-6 fats:
* corn oil
* soy oil
* canola oil
* cottonseed oil
* sunflower oil
* vegetable oils in general
* too many nuts
* Substitute with these oils containing omega-3:
* butter
* olive oil
* coconut oil
* cod liver oil
* high-quality fish oil
* Consume fatty fish
* Consume sardines

**Other causes:**

* Muscle compensation
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* DJD (degenerative joint disease)
* Gallbladder problem (indicated by right shoulder pain)
* Injuries
* Sacroiliac (S-I)

## What are the potential causes of low energy, and how do factors such as lifestyle, medical conditions, and nutritional deficiencies contribute to this issue?

Having low energy can be caused by many things. The causes below have simple remedies that will reduce the fatigue. Normally you should have a good energy level without it crashing throughout the day.

**Cause #1: Potassium deficiency**

Potassium is a very important electrolyte (electrically charged mineral) for your body and its energy levels. You need 4,700 mg of potassium daily to support your body’s energy metabolism. If you are deficient in potassium, it can definitely cause low energy. You can mainly get potassium from raw vegetables.

**Cause #2: High insulin**

Insulin is a hormone that lowers the blood sugar after it spikes and also stores it as fat in your body. If you consume a lot of sugar and refined carbs this can result in insulin lowering your blood sugar below its normal level. This will cause irritation, tiredness, fatigue, and low energy until you eat sugar and carbs again. Additionally, over time it will become hard for your cells to get enough potassium, because high amounts of insulin over a long time period reduce the ability of your cells to absorb potassium.

**Cause #3: Insufficient sleep**

Sleep allows your body to recharge and be ready for the next day, energy-wise. If you are not sleeping well or you sleep but don’t rest throughout the night, this can cause problems with low energy the next day.

**Cause #4: Energy drinks**

Energy drinks can be the cause of low energy, because they contain a lot of sugar as well as caffeine (stimulant). Caffeine will give you a synthetic sense of energy and eventually (if you consume it regularly and often) will wear out your adrenals (stress-regulating glands). Consuming energy drinks will give you a sense of energy for some time, but will result in a feeling of fatigue soon after. This tends to make you want to drink more energy drinks.

**Cause #5: Not enough phytonutrients**

Your body has certain components in the cells called mitochondria that can be considered as small energy factories. Your mitochondria are under constant assault from smoking, pollution and chemicals, along with high sugar, insulin and other factors. There are certain foods from plants that are called phytonutrients, as well as certain nutrients, that prevent the damage. The same phytonutrients also repair your mitochondria.

## What are the potential causes of numbness in the foot?

This condition is known as peripheral neuropathy, often associated with diabetes. To address it, consider incorporating benfotiamine and alpha-lipoic acid into your regimen, as both have shown effectiveness in alleviating symptoms.

***

## What are the potential causes of pain under the rib cage?

Abdominal pain under the rib cage could be due to several causes. Most of them are connected to your liver or digestion.

**Cause #1: SIBO**

SIBO is a condition where a good portion of your friendly bacteria is in the wrong place. It’s in the small intestine instead of being located mostly in the large intestine where it belongs. This condition can cause a lot of bloating.

**Cause #2: Blockage in the digestive ducts**

Your liver and pancreas are connected with certain digestive ducts. When you have blockage in these ducts, it can result in bile or other enzymes being unable to go through, causing inflammation.

On the pancreas side, blockage of its ducts will not allow certain enzymes to flow through, causing damage or inflammation in the pancreatic tissue or its ducts.

***

## What are the potential causes of panic attacks?

**Cause #1: High amounts of stress**

High amounts of stress can cause your adrenals (stress-regulating glands) to overwork and not function properly. When they are not functioning correctly, they can’t control a high amount of stress and overcome it. The solution would be to support your nervous system and brain so your adrenals are able to calm your body down if it receives a sudden stress.

**Cause #2: Hypoglycemia (especially if you get a panic attack for no clear reason)**

If you are on a high-carb diet, this can cause spikes in your blood sugar levels, and as result, your body will increase Insulin (fat-storing hormone) to lower it. Eventually, this can result in your body overproducing insulin as your cells are becoming resistant to it. Insulin, in its turn, will cause severe drops of blood sugar levels.

This is called hypoglycemia (too-low blood sugar). Hypoglycemia alone has symptoms of anxiety, panic attacks, fear, etc.

One of the ways to test whether low blood sugar is causing panic attacks is this: if you consume fewer sweets and carbs and you feel calmer, then hypoglycemia is the underlying issue.

## What are the potential causes of poor night vision?

Poor night vision means it’s hard to see during the night or when it is dark. Let’s look at the root cause behind it.

**Symptoms:**

* Can’t see at night
* Disoriented when it’s dark outside

**Cause #1: Vitamin A deficiency**

One of the functions of vitamin A is to sensitize the cells in the eye to respond to light. Without vitamin A you will not be able to see at night. The active form of vitamin A is called retinol. Retinol is found mainly in animal products. If consuming vitamin A-rich foods doesn’t remedy the situation I suggest improving the absorption of it by assisting the liver with the production of bile (absorbs vitamin A).

***

## What are the potential causes of red skin spots?

When you have poor blood clotting you may have red, pink or purple spots on your skin. Let’s look at the known remedies for this condition.

**Cause #1: Lack of vitamin K1 and C**

Vitamin K1 and C are very important for a healthy flow of blood through your body. Low levels of vitamin K1 can cause poor blood clotting. If you have low vitamin C, then you may have impaired capillary strength. As a result you can have red, pink or purple spots.

**Cause #2: Poor digestion of the above vitamins**

If you have gallbladder or liver issues, they can cause difficulties in digesting the above vitamins. If you consume enough vitamins from the above sources but the condition doesn’t resolve, it could be due to poor digestion and lack of bile.

## What are the potential causes of short-term memory loss?

Short-term memory loss can create a lot of difficulties that make life harder. The area of the brain that is responsible for your short-term memory is called the hippocampus. Any type of damage to the hippocampus can cause problems with memory in general.

**Symptoms:**

* Asking the same questions repeatedly
* Forgetting where you just put something
* Forgetting recent events
* Forgetting something you saw or read recently

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiency**

There are several nutrients that are vital for the healthy functioning of the brain. If you are deficient in these nutrients, the hippocampus will be affected most. The good thing is that it can regenerate if you restore your normal levels of those nutrients.

-Vitamin B1 is a very important vitamin for healthy brain function as well as for your nervous system.

-Vitamin D has many health-related functions, including healthy development and upkeep of the brain. Out of all the brain areas that are affected by vitamin D deficiency, the hippocampus feels the deficiency most.

-If you are deficient in zinc (mineral) your hippocampus won’t work properly, resulting in a short-term memory problem.

-If your brain doesn’t have enough oxygen this can result in damage of the hippocampus.

**Cause #2: High-carb diet**

If you are on a high-carb diet this can result in brain starvation because blood sugar is not the best source of fuel for the healthy functioning of the brain, including the hippocampus. There is another type of fuel that your brain loves: ketones (a byproduct of your body burning its own fat). Additionally, intermittent fasting will trigger certain processes that will regenerate your hippocampus.

## What are the potential causes of skin discoloration, and how do factors such as sun exposure, medical conditions, and hormonal changes contribute to this issue?

Discolored skin patches commonly develop in a certain part of the body due to a difference in melanin levels (melanin is a substance that gives color to the skin and protects it from the sun). Sometimes you may have darkened skin spots, or whitened. Each of these has its own causes and remedies.

**If you have dark skin spots**

There are few different hormonal causes for the irregular work of melanin resulting in darkened skin spots. Usually this means that melanin is overproduced in a certain area of the skin.

* Insulin is responsible for lowering the blood sugar levels in your body. Additionally, insulin increases the level of certain hormones called androgens, which are responsible for dark spots on the skin and for acne.
* If your body has excess estrogen that can be the reason for skin discoloration or dark spots, especially if intermittent fasting and a Healthy Keto diet didn’t resolve the skin condition.
* Cortisol is a hormone that is being produced when you are undergoing stress, whether mental or physical. If you have chronic stress, this will cause too-high cortisol, which can result in dark spots on your skin.

**If you have white skin spots (tinea versicolor)**

White skin patches are caused by the type of fungus that is called tinea versicolor. This fungus causes white/lighter spots on the skin, mainly on the chest and back. It does it by blocking melanin (the substance that is responsible for skin coloration).

## What are the potential causes of sore, bleeding gums?

Soreness or bleeding in the gums can create a lot of difficulties and discomfort. There is one main cause behind this problem. Let’s look at it.

Symptoms:

* Red gums
* Blood on toothbrush
* Sore gums

**Cause #1: Vitamin C deficiency**

Sore/bleeding gums can be caused by a vitamin C deficiency. A very important thing to know about vitamin C is that the most commonly sold version of it, called ascorbic acid, is only one fourth of the actual vitamin C complex. When you take only ascorbic acid you will deplete your body of the rest of the vital parts of actual vitamin C, and the result will not remedy sore or bleeding gums.

## What are the potential causes of tachycardia?

Tachycardia, also known as POTS, is the inability to tolerate different positions, let’s say when you suddenly get up (or get up in general) and feel dizzy or your pulse rate spikes.

**Symptoms:**

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Pain/fibromyalgia
* Tingling of the feet and hands
* Anxiety
* Depression

**Cause #1: Vitamin B1 deficiency**

Tachycardia is a problem connected with the nervous system. Tachycardia symptoms are the same as those for vitamin B1 deficiency. Vitamin B1 is very important for normal functioning of your nervous system as well as for regulating your stress levels.

**Other causes:**

*   Vaccinations

## What are the potential causes of vertigo?

One cause is having mucus in your sinuses. Another cause is having calcium deposits in the inner ear.

What is potentially behind these problems?

* Too much calcium – Flunarizine is a drug that acts as a calcium antagonist. This means that it blocks calcium. If your situation gets better on this drug, this is a sign that your vertigo is related to too much calcium.
* Not enough vitamin D – New studies show that low levels of vitamin D may contribute to vertigo. Vitamin D is involved in calcium metabolism and regulation. It is also important for promoting the normal function of the immune system, which can potentially reduce sinus congestion.
* Low vitamin K2 – Vitamin K2 helps remove calcium from the wrong places in your body. It then transports the calcium to the bones.

The best remedies for vertigo are:

* Vitamin D3 (10,000 IU/day)
* Vitamin K2 - MK7 version (100 mcg/day)

***

## What are the potential causes of white patches on the tongue, and how do factors such as infections, oral conditions, and irritants contribute to this phenomenon?

White tongue can cause cosmetic discomforts. I always suggest handling the problem from the inside out. Cleaning the tongue is only a temporary solution and will not resolve the underlying issues.

**Cause 1: Overgrowth of candida**

Candida normally is a friendly microbe in the body. But this microbe can turn into fungus if you take antibiotics, birth control pills, or if you are on a high-carb diet. The solution is to improve your bacterial balance in the body. It should be noted that if you take probiotics in quantities that are too great, or fermented foods without preparing for them, these can be the cause of microbial imbalance and can result in continuance of the white tongue. Therefore, start gradually.

## What are the potential dangers of low sodium levels in the body?

Hyponatremia is a situation where you’re losing a lot of blood volume, which can result in low blood pressure and a lot of other problems.

**The symptoms of low sodium include:**

• Edema in the brain

• Headaches

• Nausea

• Muscle cramps

• Fainting

• Falling

• Loss of appetite

• Confusion

• Coma

• Cardiovascular disease

• Stroke

Many people believe salt is bad for them and they avoid using any salt in their food. The problem is that this can result in low sodium. You need at least 1-1.2 grams of sodium each day, or 2-5 grams of salt per day. Keep in mind that salt can be hidden in many foods. It’s important to find the right balance since too much and too little can have adverse effects.

Many people drink way too much water because they are convinced it’s healthy. Excessive water consumption can deplete minerals like sodium. Drink when you are thirsty—don’t force yourself to drink water.

## What are the potential effects and physiological changes experienced during a period of abstaining from caffeine?

Reducing caffeine intake can yield significant health benefits, including decreased anxiety, improved sleep, and enhanced overall well-being. Symptoms associated with caffeine consumption, such as high blood pressure and digestive issues, may diminish. Transitioning from coffee to tea or herbal substitutes and supplementing with vitamins B1 and B12, along with adaptogens like ashwagandha, can support a smoother withdrawal process and promote long-term health.

## What are the potential effects of high blood sugar levels on nerve health?

There could be damage to your motor or sensory nerves. The condition is called peripheral neuropathy. You can also have problems with the autonomic nerves and even the nerves to the eye, and high blood sugar can also affect the blood vessels that innervate your nerves.

Dr. Berg recommends the ketogenic approach and intermittent fasting, including adding B-vitamins (from the nutritional yeast). B-vitamins also supports the myelin sheath around the nerves.

## What are the potential health risks associated with low cholesterol levels, and how can they affect overall well-being?

Cholesterol is often misunderstood as solely harmful, but it serves crucial roles in the body:

1\. **Recycling**: About 90% of cholesterol in the body is recycled, highlighting its essential nature.

2\. **Hormone Precursor**: It is a precursor for sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen, vital for hormonal balance.

3\. **Protective Role**: Cholesterol acts as a repair substance for damaged arterial walls, crucial in response to inflammation.

4\. **Daily Production**: The body produces approximately 2000 mg of cholesterol daily, underscoring its physiological necessity.

5\. **Metabolic Link to Sugar**: Excess sugar can convert to cholesterol and contribute to inflammation, emphasizing dietary impacts.

6\. **Role of Bile**: Bile aids in cholesterol breakdown, illustrating its regulated metabolic processing.

## What are the potential health risks associated with the presence of glucose in urine?

It means that your blood sugars or the glucose in your blood are minimally at 225 or more – this is one of the ways that the body is trying to get rid of the toxic glucose by peeing it out and it is called Osmotic Diuresis.

The complication of having this is it pulls out minerals specifically potassium, sodium, chloride, and more that cause dehydration.

**Low Minerals Symptoms:**

• Headache

• Fatigue

## What are the potential reasons behind cravings for non-food substances like chalk, dirt, ice, or paper, and what underlying conditions might these cravings indicate?

Unusual cravings often have a root cause. Cravings for chalk, dirt, clay, laundry starch, ice, paper, or tinfoil are signs of nutritional deficiency.

**Cause #1: Low iron and zinc**

A deficiency in zinc or iron can cause cravings for things like chalk, dirt, paper, and ice.

## What are the potential reasons for easy bruising?

Bruising, or contusions, occurs when capillaries under the skin bleed internally due to impact or weakness. While common, frequent bruising can indicate underlying issues:

1\. **Nutrient Deficiencies:**

\- **Calcium:** Essential for vein and capillary structure.

\- **Vitamin D:** Aids calcium absorption; sunlight and supplements are sources.

\- **Vitamin K1:** Crucial for blood clotting; found in leafy greens and supplements.

\- **Vitamin C:** Strengthens capillaries; obtained from cruciferous vegetables and complex supplements.

\- **Vitamin B12 and B9:** Support blood clotting; sources include fish, poultry, eggs, and leafy greens.

2\. **Medications:**

\- Blood-thinning medications and calcium channel blockers can increase bruising risk by inhibiting clot formation.

\- Consult a doctor to reassess medication dosages if you suspect this as a cause.

3\. **Other Factors:**

\- Gastric bypass surgery can impact nutrient absorption, potentially leading to deficiencies that contribute to bruising.

Maintaining a balanced diet rich in vegetables and consulting healthcare providers for proper evaluation and treatment are crucial for managing frequent bruising effectively.

## What are the potential reasons for feeling the need for an afternoon nap?

Need for an afternoon nap can create difficulties in your day. The important thing to know is that it is a condition which is connected to your blood sugars. Fixing your diet will remedy the need for naps during the day.

**Cause #1: Blood sugar crash**

Consuming carbs and sweets will increase blood sugar. Your body will lower the blood sugar amounts below normal levels by producing Insulin (fat-storing hormone). As a result, low blood sugar will cause sleepiness, low energy as well as will cause you to feel hungry, even though you just ate recently. This can be the cause of needing to nap during the day.

**Cause #2: Low stomach acid**

We need high stomach acidity to be able to break down and digest the load of food that we consume. If your stomach is not acidic enough, this can result in the food just sitting there in the stomach and not being digested fast enough. This can cause afternoon sleepiness.

**Cause #3: Poor quality of sleep**

If you had a bad night of sleep this can result in the need for an afternoon nap. If your sleep quality is high and you rest and recover well at night, then you will not feel sleepy during the day, provided that your blood sugar levels are normal and food is digested well.

## What are the potential reasons for memory loss?

Symptoms of memory loss have to do with the hippocampus. The hippocampus is an area of the brain that is responsible for short-term, long-term and spatial memory (remembering things that are located somewhere--for example where you parked your car).

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiency**

There are several nutrients that are vital for the healthy functioning of the brain. If you are deficient in those nutrients, the hippocampus is the part of your brain that will be affected most. The good thing is that it can regenerate if you restore your normal levels of the nutrients.

\- Vitamin B1 is a very important vitamin for healthy brain function, as well as for your nervous system.

\- Vitamin D has many health-related functions, including healthy development and upkeep of the brain. Out of all brain areas that are affected by a D deficiency, the hippocampus feels the lack of vitamin D most.

\- If you are deficient in zinc (mineral) your hippocampus won’t work properly, resulting in short- term memory problems.

\- Additionally, If your brain doesn’t have enough oxygen this can result in damage to the hippocampus.

**Remedies:**

* Restore vitamin B1 in your body:
  * take nutritional yeast
  * avoid refined carbs and sugar
  * avoid things and people that stress you out
  * take long walks
* Restore vitamin D in your body:
  * take vitamin D3 (10,000 to 20,000 IU daily)
  * take virgin cod liver oil
* Restore zinc in your body:
  * consume beef liver
  * consume shellfish
  * take a zinc supplement
* Restore oxygen in your body:
  * exercise
  * take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes)
  * hyperbaric oxygen therapy

**Cause #2: High-carb diet**

If you are on a high-carb diet this can result in a brain starvation as blood sugar is not the best source of fuel for your brain, including the hippocampus. There is another type of fuel that your brain loves: ketones (a byproduct of your body burning its own fat). Additionally, intermittent fasting will trigger certain processes that will regenerate your hippocampus.

**Remedies:**

* Avoid refined carbs and sweets
* Avoid snacking
* Take MCT oil (source of ketones)
* Take exogenous ketones supplement
* Do the Healthy Keto® diet
* Do intermittent fasting

**Cause #3: High cortisol**

Cortisol is a stress hormone that is being produced by your adrenals (stress-regulating glands). High amounts of cortisol can damage your hippocampus. The solution to that would be to improve your mental and physical stress resistance and recovery.

**Remedies:**

* Consume vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

* Improve sleep (take naps if needed)
* Take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes)
* Avoid things or people that stress you out
* You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support
* You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Other causes:**

*   Aging (Healthy Keto + intermittent fasting will help)

## What are the potential reasons for shortness of breath when climbing stairs?

If you are out of breath when climbing stairs this could be due to several reasons. Although an underlying disease can cause shortness of breath after climbing stairs, diet and lifestyle choices can also be at the root of this problem.

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiencies**

Vitamins and minerals are essential for managing lung function, inflammation, muscle function, and heart activity. If you are deficient in vital nutrients, you can have a difficult time catching your breath. The main vitamin to pay attention to is B1. One of the main effects of a B1 deficiency is that you find you have breathing problems.

**Cause #2: pH imbalances**

A highly acidic body (acidosis) or a highly alkaline body (alkalosis) can cause you to feel out of breath or hungry for air. The solution is simple: normalize your pH level with the right diet.

## What are the potential reasons for sugar cravings, and how do factors such as hormonal fluctuations, emotional triggers, and dietary habits contribute to this desire?

Craving sugar is a very common problem, especially if you are trying to get onto a healthy diet. It can be caused by several underlying issues. Let’s break it down and look at some simple remedies to the problem.

**Cause #1: High-carb diet**

When you are on a high-carb diet your body will produce insulin (fat-storing hormone) to lower the blood sugar spikes. High blood sugar will make you feel satisfied after the high-sugar / high- carb meal. However, a few hours later, the insulin will drop the blood sugar too low, causing you to crave these foods again. The cycle repeats.

Additionally, consuming refined carbs and sugar increases the hormones and chemicals in the body that are related to pleasure, making you feel satisfied when you are consume them.

A high-carb diet is very addictive, with many side effects.

The solution is to get on the Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting. When you start following them, in a few days your body will adapt to a new healthy type of fuel: ketones (instead of sugar).

Ketones are a byproduct of your body burning its own fat. If your body is adapted to ketones you will feel much more energetic, less stressed, healthier, and you will have no cravings or hunger whatsoever. As an additional reward, you will burn fat.

**Cause #2: Snacking**

Eating between meals, even if it’s not much food, will raise your level of insulin. This is because eating in general will raise insulin. Insulin in turn will lower your blood sugar levels, and shortly after your snack you will feel hunger and cravings again.

**Cause #3: Stress**

When you are undergoing stress, you may feel like eating sweets and carbohydrates. This usually has its roots in being accustomed to a high-carb diet. When you eat carbs out of stress, you may feel satisfied temporarily, because your blood sugar and dopamine (pleasure-related chemical produced by your body) go high. Shortly after, when they drop, you will feel stressed again and will crave carbs to feel better. The solution would be to get on the right diet and get your stress levels under control.

Additionally, if you constantly undergo stress, your stress hormone, called cortisol, is going to break down your body proteins and turn them into sugar. This will spike your blood sugar and make your body produce insulin to lower it. Once blood sugar is lowered below the normal level, you will crave sugar and carbs.

***

## What are the potential reasons for waking up feeling exhausted?

Waking up exhausted in the morning can cause you to be less efficient during the day. There are several causes that could be behind this problem. True remedies should improve your sleep quality, making you feel more energetic when you wake up.

**Cause 1: Lights before going to bed**

Being exposed to light will reduce the production of melatonin (sleep hormone). If you have lights on around you before going to bed this effect can keep you awake.

**Cause 2: Chronic stress**

When you are undergoing constant stress it can cause difficulty sleeping, including not being able to rest fully at night. This is because your stress-regulating glands (adrenals) are worn out.

**Cause 3: Electromagnetic fields**

Electronic devices generate electronic waves around them if the device is plugged in, even if it is turned off. If you sit in front of the computer all day this can badly affect your sleep at night. The electronic waves decrease the production of melatonin (a sleep hormone) in your body.

**Cause 4: Caffeine**

Caffeine is a stimulant which can keep you up at night and cause you to have poor sleep. It takes time for the liver to detoxify such stimulants. Too much caffeine from coffee and tea will prevent your body from fully relaxing.

**Cause 5: Nutritional deficiency**

Not having enough nutrients can cause inefficient rest during sleep hours. There are several nutrients that are needed for good rest at night while sleeping. These nutrients have to do with keeping your nervous system and sleep hormones working properly to result in good sleep.

**Cause 6: Altered pH (too-acid or too-alkaline body)**

Your body may be too alkaline or too acidic. Let’s look at the symptoms of being too alkaline (alkalosis) or being too acidic (acidosis) because both of them can potentially cause sleep problems.

Alkalosis: If you’re too alkaline, your muscles are going to be tense and tight, which can cause cramping at night and in general.

## What are the potential side effects of gallbladder removal?

**Some of the common symptoms associated with gallbladder removal include the following:**

• Constipation

• Diarrhea

• Anal leakage

• Fullness under the right rib cage

• Right shoulder pain

• Collins’ sign pain

You can live a long, healthy life without a gallbladder, but unfortunately, 40% of people who’ve had their gallbladder removed end up with persistent pain and symptoms for a year or more.

The gallbladder is an extension of the liver that holds and concentrates bile. Every time you eat, it contracts and releases bile into the small intestine. Bile begins to break down fat, allowing the pancreas to further break down fat by releasing an enzyme called lipase. Bile is critical for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, E, D, and K, as well as essential fatty acids. Bile also helps you get rid of excess cholesterol.

## What are the potential underlying causes and contributing factors associated with the development of endometriosis?

**Endometriosis** is a condition whereby the body is making extra tissue that grows outside the uterus - including the Fallopian tubes and ovaries. Estrogen dominance is the deeper cause of this.

Estrogen is anabolic (which means it makes things grow). Symptoms include painful periods, low back pain, and infertility.

**WHAT TO DO:**

1\. Eat organic as much as possible

2\. Eat cruciferous vegetables

3\. Increase iodine, which helps regular estrogen, in the form of sea kelp.

## What are the potential underlying causes of experiencing numbness in the hands?

Myelin, crucial for nerve function, can be compromised by conditions like diabetes and thiamine deficiency, leading to symptoms such as numbness in hands and feet. Benfotiamine and dietary adjustments may help address thiamine deficiency.

Numbness in hands can also stem from vitamin B12 deficiency, which presents with symptoms like gait imbalance and spinal discomfort. Age-related low stomach acid can hinder B12 absorption, countered by betaine hydrochloride to boost acidity.

Low vitamin B12 may result from dietary insufficiency, antacids, metformin use, genetic factors, or digestive inflammation. Methylcobalamin supplementation, potentially with methylfolate and vitamin B6, is recommended for effective B12 intake and absorption, especially for those with genetic susceptibilities.

## What are the potential underlying factors that could contribute to the cessation of my menstrual cycle?

The term you're looking for is "metabolomics," which allows for an in-depth analysis of your biochemical processes, providing a wealth of information beyond what standard blood tests can offer. If you're considering a hormone test, it might help identify any imbalances that could be affecting your menstrual cycle. If you’re following a healthy ketogenic diet and ensuring you’re getting all the necessary nutrients, you shouldn't experience such issues. However, it's crucial to evaluate the specific foods in your diet to ensure they are nutrient-dense. A more comprehensive understanding of your eating habits would be necessary for a thorough assessment.

## What are the primary causes and contributing factors associated with Graves' disease?

Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid is producing too much thyroid hormone. In the whole thyroid-generating cycle there is no turn-off switch to the production of active thyroid hormone (T3) so it keeps being pumped out more and more.

Symptoms:

* Irritability
* Muscle weakness
* Sleeplessness
* Increased heart rate
* Heart hypertrophy
* Decreased tolerance to heat
* Diarrhea
* Eyes bulging out
* Tremor
* Panic and anxiety

**Cause #1: Graves’ disease (autoimmune)**

Graves disease is an autoimmune condition, which means that your own immune system attacks your own healthy body cells. This can affect your thyroid and can cause it to generate more active thyroid hormones than are needed, known as a hyperthyroid condition.

**Cause #2: Too much stress**

If you undergo consistent stress, this can cause a hyperthyroid condition and overaction of your adrenal glands. This is because your adrenals (stress-regulating glands) support other glands, for example the thyroid. If your adrenals are burned out (because of consistent stress) it will affect your thyroid.

**Cause #4: High-carb diet**

If you consume a lot of carbs or you snack often, these can cause your body to produce insulin to lower the high amounts of blood sugar. Insulin is an inflammatory hormone, which means that the inflammation it creates can affect your thyroid, preventing it from working as it should.

## What are the primary causes and risk factors associated with diverticulitis, and how do dietary and lifestyle choices contribute to its development?

Diverticulitis is an inflammation of the little pouches (diverticula) in your colon. It can create a lot of abdominal pain and discomfort in the body.

**Cause #1: Consuming foods that are inflammatory**

If you consume a lot of refined carbs and GMO foods, as well as oils containing omega-6 fatty acids, these things can cause a lot of problems throughout the body--including the inside of your colon. This is because these types of foods create inflammation. Snacking often and consuming a lot of carbs in general will increase the quantity of insulin, an inflammatory hormone, in your blood.

## What are the primary causes of a receding hairline?

**There are a couple of reasons:**

One is that you have high levels of something called 5 alpha reductase which is an enzyme that converts testosterone into a more powerful form of testosterone called DHT. DHT can burn out your hair follicles.

Second, you have higher androgens, not necessarily caused by having high levels of 5 alpha reductase, they’re simply higher. **You can reduce or inhibit 5 alpha reductase by taking zinc, omega 3, and B2. Zinc is the most important element to ensure you get enough of it. And if you think about it, zinc is also important for your immune system. So if you have alopecia, for example, which is an autoimmune condition then zinc is even more important. You’ll also want to add vitamin D.**

## What are the primary causes of chronic inflammation, and how do factors such as lifestyle, autoimmune disorders, and environmental triggers contribute to its development?

Inflammation is a vital immune response but can become chronic due to various factors:

1\. **Vitamin D Deficiency:**

\- **Cause:** Linked to chronic inflammation and autoimmune conditions.

\- **Remedies:** Sunlight exposure, vitamin D supplements, and vitamin K2 for calcium balance.

2\. **Allergies:**

\- **Cause:** Triggered by food or environmental allergens, leading to systemic inflammation.

\- **Remedies:** Identify and avoid allergens, use apple cider vinegar, and manage diet.

3\. **Low Cortisol:**

\- **Cause:** Stress-related adrenal fatigue or cortisol resistance exacerbate inflammation.

\- **Remedies:** Support with vitamin B1, improve sleep, manage stress, and consider adrenal support supplements.

4\. **High Insulin:**

\- **Cause:** Insulin resistance from excessive carb intake leads to systemic inflammation.

\- **Remedies:** Adopt Healthy Keto® diet, intermittent fasting, and potassium-rich foods.

5\. **Infection:**

\- **Cause:** Viral or bacterial infections can sustain inflammation if immune response is compromised.

\- **Remedies:** Boost immune system with vitamin D, intermittent fasting, and natural antibiotics.

6\. **Omega-6 Fatty Acids:**

\- **Cause:** Overconsumption promotes inflammation; replace with omega-3 sources.

\- **Remedies:** Avoid omega-6 rich oils and foods, opt for high-quality fish oil and grass-fed products.

7\. **Liver or Gallbladder Issues:**

\- **Cause:** Impaired bile production affects fat absorption and aggravates inflammation.

\- **Remedies:** Intermittent fasting, Healthy Keto® diet, purified bile salts, and avoiding alcohol and sugar.

8\. **Free Iron/Oxidants Damage:**

\- **Cause:** Excess free iron or oxidative stress can trigger inflammation and tissue damage.

\- **Remedies:** Avoid synthetic iron supplements and oxidant-rich foods, consider nutrient-rich sources like grass-fed organ meats.

Additional measures include intermittent fasting, probiotics for gut health, antioxidant-rich foods, and avoiding GMOs and processed foods. Addressing these factors can help manage and reduce chronic inflammation effectively.

## What are the primary causes of heart palpitations?

Palpitations are either a skipped heartbeat, an extra pounding, or a speeding up of your heart rate. The rhythm of the heart is controlled by electrolytes (potassium, magnesium sodium, and calcium).

You can be deficient in these minerals if you omit them from the diet like not eating enough vegetables. You can also have insulin resistance and thereby not absorb electrolytes and develop palpitations. Insulin resistance also forces the body to make more insulin because it's now resistant. This is another reason why you see palpitations as a side effect of taking insulin. Or you can have low stomach acid and not absorb minerals. It takes an acidic stomach to absorb minerals. When you are low in stomach acids, you then get acid reflux (heart burning or GERD), and in fact, palpitations are one of the associative symptoms of having acid reflux and now you know why.

## What are the primary causes of Hepatitis C?

Hepatitis C is a viral infection that targets liver cells, leading to inflammation and potentially severe complications like diabetes, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Symptoms include fatigue, flu-like symptoms, dark urine, abdominal pain, and jaundice.

Causes and remedies:

\- **Infection:** Hepatitis C is transmitted through blood contact. Strengthening the immune system is crucial. Adopting the Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting can reduce liver inflammation and aid recovery. Limiting iron intake starves the virus.

\- **Supporting Liver Health:** Consume antioxidants like parsley, cruciferous vegetables, milk thistle, and vitamins (C, E, B complex). Enhance immune function with oregano oil, garlic, and vitamin D. Avoid liver-damaging substances such as alcohol, vegetable oils, and omega-6 fatty acids.

\- **Medications:** Reduce medication intake under medical supervision as some medications can strain the liver.

Managing these factors supports liver recovery and overall health when dealing with hepatitis C.

## What are the primary causes of high cholesterol, and how do factors such as diet, genetics, and lifestyle choices contribute to this condition?

Cholesterol is vital for brain function, hormone production, and cell health, acting as a repair substance in arteries damaged by inflammation. Factors influencing cholesterol levels include diet, bile production, thyroid function, and various health conditions:

\- **High-Carb Diet:** Increases insulin production, converting blood sugar into cholesterol. Remedies include the Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting.

\- **Lack of Bile:** Impairs fat absorption and cholesterol elimination. Remedies include apple cider vinegar and purified bile salts.

\- **Hypothyroidism:** Low thyroid function can elevate cholesterol levels. Remedies include consuming sea kelp and selenium-rich foods.

Other factors like intestinal damage, antibiotic use, and certain health conditions can also affect cholesterol levels. Managing these factors is crucial for maintaining optimal cholesterol levels and overall health.

## What are the primary causes of inflammation, and how do various internal and external factors contribute to its development in the body?

Inflammation is a normal healing and repair process. But, if you experience chronic inflammation, all sorts of destruction can occur. If you can get rid of inflammation, you can get rid of the complications and symptoms of autoimmune diseases, old injuries, and more.

Inflammatory oncotaxis is a phenomenon where cancer tends to spread to areas where you experienced old injuries where there was inflammation. An old injury could mean many different things, such as food irritation to the colon, damage to the lungs from smoking, damage to the arteries from a high carb diet, or injuries.

**The top causes of inflammation:**

1\. Lack of cortisol

2\. Allergies

3\. Acute and chronic infections

4\. Gut inflammation (gut issues or inflammatory foods)

5\. Glucose/sugar

6\. Fat cells

7\. Old injuries

8\. Problems in the bile ducts

## What are the primary causes of low testosterone, and how do factors such as age, hormonal imbalances, and medical conditions contribute to this issue?

Low testosterone in men mainly is caused by the excess amount of other hormones in your body that counter testosterone. These hormones are cortisol, insulin and especially estrogen. The main remedy is to decrease the amounts of these hormones, which should greatly improve this condition.

**Symptoms:**

* Decreased libido
* Decreased erections
* Decreased vitality
* Weight gain (midsection)
* Can’t build muscle mass
* Skin thinner and softer
* Voice higher
* Prostate enlargement
* Breast tissue (man boobs)
* Loss of body hair
* Loss of collagen
* Reduction of sperm

**Cause #1: High estrogen**

High amounts of estrogen (the female hormone that is also produced in small amounts in a male body) can greatly lower the amounts of testosterone in your body. Consuming foods that are high in estrogen (like soy or GMO foods) can do that. If you have high amounts of body fat, it can do that too, as human body fat contains certain proteins that convert testosterone to estrogen.

**Remedies:**

* Consume foods that will lower estrogen levels:
  * cruciferous vegetables (natural estrogen blockers)
  * DIM (concentrated cruciferous)
  * white button mushrooms
  * mushrooms in general
  * celery
  * parsley
  * olive oil
* Avoid foods that will increase estrogen:
  * soy
  * vegetable oils
  * GMO foods
  * alcohol
  * soy-fed chicken
  * soy-fed beef

**Cause #2: High insulin**

One of the effects of insulin (the fat-storing hormone) is to lower testosterone in your body. If you are on a high-carb diet, this will increase the amount of insulin produced by your body to lower the blood sugar spikes after meals. Consuming snacks too often will raise insulin level after each of those snacks, too.

**Remedies:**

* Avoid refined sugar and carbs
* Avoid snacking
* Do the Healthy Keto® diet
* Do an intermittent fasting plan

**Cause #3: High cortisol**

Your body is producing the stress hormone called cortisol to help you adapt to stressors from your environment. Cortisol in itself will lower testosterone levels in the body. If the stress is constant, or chronic, this can overwork your adrenals--making them produce excess cortisol too often.

**Remedies:**

* Take vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

* Improve your sleep
  * avoid blue lights (computer/phone) before going to bed
  * disconnect electronic devices from the outlets before going to bed
  * take naps if needed
  * try to go to bed before 10:30 p.m.
* Avoid watching news (bad news can keep you in a bad mood)
* Take magnesium
* Take vitamin D
* Do the Healthy Keto® diet
* Take long walks outside (at least 45 minutes)
* Regularly exercise (don’t overtrain)
* You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support
* You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Cause #2: High amounts of stress**

General remedies to raise the level of testosterone in your body

Once you’ve eliminated and remedied the main causes of low testosterone, the remedies below might not be needed. Your body should be producing enough testosterone by then, since there is nothing lowering it or converting it to something else. But you can apply the remedies below as additional ways to elevate your testosterone levels.

**Remedies:**

* Consume more cholesterol (helps to make testosterone)
* Consume moderate amounts of protein (6 to 8 oz of protein in meal)
* Full-body exercise
* HIIT exercise
* Improve sleep
* Consume zinc (100 mg / day)
* Consume korean red ginseng
* Take L-arginine
* Take D-aspartic acid

**Other causes:**

* Aging
* Fatty liver
* Too much iron
*   Medications:

    • statins

    * high blood pressure meds
    * medications for diabetes

## What are the primary causes of osteoporosis, and how do factors such as age, hormonal changes, and lifestyle choices contribute to its development?

Osteoporosis means a severe loss of bone mass and density. Osteopenia is a lesser version of it. What is important to know is that consuming calcium (which is used as a general remedy) is not going to remedy it. Bone is made from protein, minerals and calcium--not just from calcium.

**Cause #1: Stress**

When you are undergoing stress, your adrenal glands produce cortisol (stress hormone). Cortisol in itself does damage your bones. When you are undergoing chronic stress, and your body is not recovering well from it, this can cause osteoporosis.

**Cause #2: Vitamin D and K2 deficiency**

VItamin D is a vital hormone for healthy functioning of your bones, immune system, mood etc. It increases the absorption of calcium by 20x. Additionally, vitamin K2 allocates free calcium units in the blood to needed tissues. Vitamin D and K2 work together. If you are deficient in them, this can cause osteoporosis.

***

## What are the primary causes of paresthesia?

A paraesthesia is a problem with your nervous system; that is, you have some kind of abnormal nerve sensation coming from your sensory nerves. **If these nerve fibers are damaged, you can experience symptoms including:**

* Numbness
* Tingling Pins and needles
* Cold or burning pain
* Feeling of ants crawling on your skin
* Body parts feel heavy
* Hypersensitivity to pain; or, conversely, low pain sensitivity

By far the most common cause of paraesthesia is a high carbohydrate diet. By this I mean a diet with too much sugar, or refined carbs such as bread, pasta, crackers, and the like. This is because a high carb diet primarily causes a B vitamin deficiency. And this explains why most diabetics, who are told to follow a high carb diet, have issues with peripheral neuropathy, nerve damage, and paraesthesia.

## What are the primary causes of receding gums, and how do these factors contribute to gum health and overall oral hygiene?

Receding gums could actually be caused by a vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C has a lot to do with protein building, specifically collagen. When you lose collagen, your gums can start to recede.

Some bacteria have a negative effect through enzymes that break down protein. But, vitamin C can counter the effect of these enzymes. Vitamin C can help reduce the toxic effect of bacteria. If you brush your teeth and your gums bleed easily, this could be because of a vitamin C deficiency.

**Vitamin C deficiency causes:**

• You could have high levels of insulin

• You’re taking certain antibiotics

• You’re not getting enough vitamin C from your diet

## What are the primary causes of sleep apnea and snoring, and how do these conditions affect airway function and overall sleep quality?

If you have a nutritional deficiency, the structure of your bones may not fully develop. But, if you never chew, you also don’t activate the muscles around your face to make the bones structurally sound.

I believe the real cause behind breathing problems is that our mouths have become too small. If there isn’t enough space for our teeth to grow, they will be crooked. If the mouth is smaller, the airway passages will also be smaller, which will constrict a person’s breathing.

It’s crucial that kids stop consuming refined foods and start consuming foods that force them to chew more. But, as an adult, you can do things to make a change to your facial structure, which can lead to better breathing.

**What you can do:**

1\. Breath through your nose

2\. Chew your food longer

3\. Consume fat-soluble vitamins

4\. Stop consuming processed foods

5\. Consume trace minerals

***

## What are the primary causes of tetany?

Muscle twitches or tetany are erratic little nerve impulses that can start anywhere in your body. They usually go away pretty quickly.

**Cause #1: Nutrient deficiency**

If you have a certain electrolyte deficiency--specifically calcium and magnesium--you can have muscle twitches at different places in your body. These electrolytes are responsible for normal functioning of the body, including relaxation of muscles.

Additionally, manganese is needed for a certain part of the brain that is involved in suppressing abnormal muscle movement. If you are deficient in it, you can also experience tetany.

**Cause #2: Alkalosis**

If you have a too-alkaline body pH it can result in tetany. The reason behind this is that when your body pH is higher than it should be, it can result in inability to correctly utilize calcium that is in your body. Calcium is an electrolyte that is needed for healthy muscle function in the body. The solution would be to acidify your body.

**Other causes:**

* Tourette’s syndrome
* High stress
* Tardive dyskinesia
* Dystonia
* Psych drugs
* Tranquilizers
* Brain damage
* Insulin resistance
* Diuretics
* Antibiotics
* Low vitamin D
* Fluoride
* Parathyroid problem
* Calcium carbonate

## What are the primary underlying causes of sciatica nerve pain?

**There are two main reasons why you could have sciatica pain:**

1\. A structural problem Where the low back curve is not there.

2\. An internal problem There is something happening with the nerve itself. The internal cause of sciatic pain has to do with an imbalance of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids. Omega 3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties, and omega 6 fatty acids are more inflammatory. We need both of these fats, but we need them in the right ratios.

**An imbalance of these fatty acids can:**

1\. Create a lot of inflammation and nerve pain.

2\. Affect the lipids around the nerves.

3\. Affect the sciatic nerve (the biggest nerve)

## What are the primary underlying factors that contribute to the development of a nodular goiter?

A goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland. You have a gland in your brain called a pituitary that creates a hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This connects to the thyroid gland. There are two purposes of TSH. First, it tells the thyroid to produce T4 and T3. Second, it causes the thyroid gland to increase in size. If there’s too much TSH, this could be why your thyroid is enlarged.

90% of the time, a goiter is a result of an iodine deficiency. Also, keep in mind that goiters can be associated with both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.

When someone who has a goiter is tested, they may find that they have higher T3 levels. This is because the body is trying to compensate. They may also have lower T4 levels.

## What are the roles of zinc in your body?

**Zinc: The Unsung Hero of Your Health**

Ever feel a bit "off" even when you're eating and sleeping well? The culprit might be a tiny but mighty mineral: zinc.

**Zinc's Vital Role in Your Body**

Zinc isn't just another nutrient; it's a key player in over 300 enzyme functions and influences countless DNA-related processes. From digestion and cell growth to memory and sleep, zinc is involved in nearly every aspect of your well-being.

**Spotting the Sneaky Signs of Zinc Deficiency**

Zinc deficiency can be subtle at first, but it's important to recognize the early warning signs:

* Loss of appetite or changes in taste
* Foul-smelling stool
* Shortness of breath during exertion

**The Serious Consequences of Low Zinc Levels**

Ignoring zinc deficiency can lead to significant health problems, including:

## What are the signs of glutathione deficiency?

### **Symptoms and Causes of Glutathione Deficiency**

Glutathione deficiency is a common problem in today's world, thanks to a perfect storm of factors like chronic stress, poor diet, environmental toxins, and genetic variations that impact glutathione production and recycling.

When levels are low, a wide range of symptoms can occur, from fatigue and brain fog to more serious health issues like autoimmune disease and neurological disorders.

![Image](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/blog-the-adrenal-fatigue-diet-1.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **Identifying Glutathione Deficiency**

So how do you know if you're running low on this critical antioxidant? Some common signs and symptoms of glutathione deficiency include:

* Fatigue and low energy
* Brain fog and memory problems
* Mood issues like anxiety and depression
* Muscle aches and weakness
* Headaches and migraines
* Skin issues like eczema and psoriasis
* Autoimmune disorders
* Neurological symptoms like tremors and numbness

Of course, these symptoms can have many different causes, so it's important to work with a healthcare provider to rule out other underlying issues.

But if you're experiencing several of these symptoms and have risk factors for glutathione deficiency, it's worth investigating further.

#### **Factors Leading to Reduced Glutathione Levels**

There are many different factors that can contribute to low glutathione levels, including:

* Chronic stress
* Poor diet (low in precursor nutrients like glycine and cysteine)
* Environmental toxins and pollutants
* Certain medications (like acetaminophen and some antibiotics)
* Chronic infections and illness
* Genetic variations (like MTHFR mutations)
* Aging

Some lifestyle factors, like smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and lack of exercise, can also deplete glutathione levels over time.

The good news is that there are many ways to naturally boost glutathione production and recycling in the body, even if you have genetic variations or other risk factors.

## What are the signs of leaky gut present?

**A very thin, single layer of cells acts as a barrier between the inside and the outside of your intestines. The intestines provide protection and absorption of 90 percent of all your nutrients. They also contain a mucus layer, microbes, and 80 percent of your immune system.**

Medical professionals typically recommend increased soluble fiber intake to fix leaky gut when you should actually do the opposite. The carnivore diet is the best leaky gut diet. More fiber creates more inflammation in this situation. Medical professionals also do not point to diet as a primary cause or solution of a leaky gut. Most diseases are triggered by something in your gut, which has everything to do with your diet.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics can also affect gut health. Tampering with your gut microbiome can have serious consequences. You need the microbes in your gut to help you digest, and you don’t want them to become pathogenic.

**Glyphosate is an herbicide sprayed on most GMO and conventional foods patented as an antibiotic, so it has an antibiotic effect on your body. Whole grains are also recommended, but they can wreak havoc on a leaky gut and cause an immune reaction. Seed oils are another major contributor to leaky gut.**

**Here are seven signs of a leaky gut:**

1\. Abdominal pain, cramping

2\. Constipation, diarrhea

3\. Fatigue

4\. Brain fog

5\. Mood issues, anxiety

6\. Skin inflammation

7\. Autoimmune diseases

When you have an autoimmune response, your body considers normal tissues foreign or pathogenic. If your body sees your thyroid as an invader, your thyroid will become inflamed. This is known as Hashimoto’s and starts with inflammation and a leaky gut. The carnivore diet for a few months can help repair a leaky gut by removing the foods causing inflammation. Glutamine and glycine can also help with leaky gut repair.

## What are the signs that my body needs specific nutrients?

**Your Body is Talking: Are You Listening?**

Our bodies are constantly sending us signals, and sometimes those signals come in the form of seemingly minor symptoms. But these "minor" issues might be your body's way of saying it needs more of a specific nutrient. Let's decode some of these common signs:

**Nerves & Brain:**

* **Tingling toes?** This could signal a vitamin B1 deficiency. Load up on pork, liver, meat, eggs, and sunflower seeds.
* **Can't stop that eye twitch?** Magnesium might be the missing link. Reach for dark leafy greens and pumpkin seeds.
* **Feeling forgetful or experiencing hearing loss?** Don't ignore the signs of a possible vitamin B12 deficiency. Red meat, liver, and clams are your friends.
* **Prematurely graying hair?** Ensure you're getting enough vitamin B9 (folate) to support healthy melanin production.

**Skin & Hair:**

* **Cracks at the corners of your mouth?** Vitamin B2 could be the culprit. Increase your intake with liver, red meat, and eggs.
* **Hair thinning?** Biotin is essential for keratin production, the building block of healthy hair.
* **Dry, flaky skin?** Boost your omega-3s with high-quality cod liver oil or fish oil.

**Hormones & Reproduction:**

* **Heavy periods with painful cramps?** Vitamin K1 (found in dark leafy greens and liver) and magnesium can help.

## What are the signs that my gallbladder is in danger?

There are twelve important signs of a gallbladder problem that I want to cover today. But, most of the time, a person with a gallbladder issue doesn't experience any symptoms at all. The majority of the time, a person has no idea they have a problem with the gallbladder. However, even though there are no major symptoms of a gallbladder problem, there are signs that can indicate your gallbladder is in trouble.

Most of these signs are related to a bile deficiency because of a blockage, but excess bile can also lead to issues.

## What are the symptoms associated with subclinical scurvy, and how do they differ from those of more advanced vitamin C deficiency?

Scurvy is a severe vitamin C deficiency. When it’s classified as subclinical, that means it doesn't show up on a typical blood test because it’s still developing. Another term for this is latent scurvy.

**Here are some of the symptoms of scurvy:**

•Capillary damage

•Fatigue

•Bleeding gums

•Weakness

•Irritability

•Leg pain

•Inflammation

•Achy joints and muscles

Your vascular system is most susceptible to vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C keeps the collagen in your arteries strong and elastic. Without enough vitamin C, your arteries can develop lesions and lose their vascular integrity. Capillary damage occurs when you have high levels of sugar in your blood. Sugar competes with the vitamin C in your body, causing vitamin C levels to drop. When you have capillary damage, arterial bleeding, and inflammation, your body sends cholesterol and calcium to repair the damage.

This can also happen in your skin, resulting in rosacea. You can also develop bleeding gums, a nosebleed, or experience damage to your nerves. In addition to vitamin C, vitamin B1(thiamine) can help protect your body from high levels of sugar in your blood.

## What are the underlying causes of food sensitivities?

If you have an allergy or high sensitivity to certain foods this can cause indigestion, and specifically inflammation in some parts of your body-including the abdomen. If your body is not used to certain foods this can cause irritation or discomfort in the abdominal area.

**Remedies:**

**When you have abdominal discomfort, look over what you ate several hours before that. Avoid that type of food next time.**

Most common foods causing allergic reactions:

* Peanuts
* Gluten
* Dairy products
* Too much caffeine (note: withdrawal symptoms can last up to two weeks)
* Chocolate
* Tobacco
* Alcohol
* Artificial sweeteners
* Sugar alcohols
* MSG (usually in the form of modified food starch)
* Cured meats
* Aged cheeses (blue, feta, parmesan)
* Pickled, fermented foods

## What are the underlying causes of heat intolerance, and how do physiological, hormonal, and medical factors contribute to an individual’s inability to tolerate heat?

Heat intolerance is a condition where you feel overheated easily when you’re in a warm environment. This often includes excessive sweating, dizziness, or weakness.

**Cause 1: Lack of vitamin B1**

Heat intolerance roots in a vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. If you’re on a low-carb diet, you simply need to increase your vitamin B1 intake. If you’re on a high-carb diet, carbs and sugar can deplete B vitamins, especially B1.

## What are the underlying causes of leaky gut syndrome?

Leaky gut is a digestive condition in which bacteria and toxins are able to “leak” through the intestinal wall. This condition can create food sensitivities and an immune system response, causing discomfort and inflammation. This is basically a scurvy in the colon.

**Symptoms:**

* Chronic diarrhea, constipation, or bloating
* Food sensitivities
* Scar tissue in the colon
* Nutritional deficiencies
* Fatigue
* Headaches
* Confusion
* Difficulty concentrating
* Skin problems
* Joint pain
* Widespread inflammation

**Cause #1: Vitamin C deficiency**

A lack of vitamin C can cause a loss of collagen in the lining of the intestines, opening gaps in the intestinal walls that allow undigested proteins or harmful bacteria to enter the intestinal cavity. So you have leaks that go into the blood vessels and that creates an immune reaction or food sensitivities.

**Remedies:**

* Take natural vitamin C complex (not ascorbic acid)
* Consume the following foods with bioflavonoid (the component of vitamin C that helps with leaky gut):
  * sprouted buckwheat
  * quercetin
  * parsley
  * onions
  * green tea
  * citrus
  * cruciferous vegetables
* Avoid things that will deplete you of vitamin C:
  * smoking
  * carbs and sweets
  * snacking

(Note: If you try the above remedies, consuming natural vitamin C complex and the foods above, and leaky gut does not resolve, the issue can be insulin resistance in the body. When you have insulin resistance, vitamin C is depleted by the high level of insulin produced in the body. In this case you should do a Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting plan.)

**Other causes:**

* Insulin resistance

***

## What are the underlying causes of low tolerance for stress, and how do psychological, environmental, and physiological factors contribute to this condition?

Low tolerance for stress is a condition where you can get an excessive reaction to things that normally wouldn’t cause so much reaction. You may get worried about little things or become easily irritated about them.

**Symptoms:**

* Worry/anxiety
* Nervous tension
* Being critical
* Excessive thinking at night
* Serious impact after bad news

**Cause #1: Adrenal fatigue**

Your adrenals are producing stress hormones to help you fight stressors from your environment. If the stress is constant, or chronic, this can wear out your adrenals-- making them unable to keep up with stress and unable to calm you down after it.

**Cause #2: Blood sugar fluctuations**

If you are on a high-carb diet, this can cause blood sugar fluctuations in your body. When your blood sugar goes high (after eating a high-carb meal) this can elevate your mood; however, shortly after you will feel irritated and can feel stressed out. This is because blood sugar will get lowered (to a point below the normal level) by insulin. Frequent eating, and refined carbs specifically, increase the production of insulin. Carbs in your diet will also deplete you of vitamin B1, which is an anti-stress vitamin.

## What are the underlying causes of melancholic depression?

Melancholy is sadness and depression and generally feeling down. Interestingly enough it comes from a Greek word that means “black bile.”

**Cause #1: Gallbladder issues**

Bile is a liquid that is being produced by your liver and is stored in your gallbladder. If you have a lack of bile production in your body, whether due to gallbladder or liver issues, this can cause severe melancholy.

The reason is that if you lack bile you will not be able to absorb vitamin D and DHA (a type of omega-3 fat that is needed for a good emotional state, among other things) from your diet. These 2 nutrients, if deficient, can have the side effect of severe depression.

## What are the underlying causes of premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a condition that affects your emotions, behavior and physical comfort or discomfort, just before the menstrual cycle--and sometimes during it as well.

Symptoms that you may experience prior to or during the menstrual cycle:

* Cramps
* Mood swings
* Nervousness
* Fatigue
* Depression
* Irritability
* Breast tenderness
* Sugar/carb cravings
* Headaches
* Hot flashes
* Breast aches

**Cause #1: High estrogen**

There is a connection between high estrogen (female hormone) and PMS symptoms. If your body has high amounts of estrogen from your diet or from other causes, like having a high percentage of body fat, this factor can cause many difficulties prior to the menstrual cycle as well as during it.

***

## What are the underlying causes of scoliosis, kyphosis, and lordosis?

Scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis are abnormal curves of your spine that can cause a lot of difficulties and pain, especially in your back.

**Symptoms:**

* Scoliosis: s-curve of the spine
* Kyphosis: hunched back
* Lordosis: lower back curved too far in

**Cause #1: Vitamin D deficiency**

Vitamin D has a lot to do with your skeletal structure as well as with bone health. If you are deficient in vitamin D this can cause scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis--along with other problems.

Vitamin D increases the absorption of calcium by 20 times. Also consuming vitamin K2 will increase the movement of free calcium in the blood to the needed tissues and bones.

## What are the underlying causes of skin tags and warts, and how do factors such as friction, viral infections, and genetic predisposition contribute to their development?

Skin tags and warts are really tiny benign tumors caused by papillomavirus. It is important to know that skin tags could also be caused by high amounts of insulin (fat-storing hormone).

**Cause #1: Papillomavirus**

Although this is not officially proven, papillomavirus is considered to be a cause of skin tags and warts. In my opinion papiloma virus has to do with developing them.

**Cause #2: High insulin**

Skin tags and warts are also caused by the body’s growth factor, which is triggered by insulin. Eating a lot of refined carbs and sugar (snacking too) will cause high amounts of Insulin. This is why, in some cases, diabetics and pre-diabetics start getting skin tags around their necks or armpits. Insulin is anabolic (a hormone that grows things) so it can cause these skin tags to grow.

## What are the underlying causes of styes, boils, and abscesses in the eye area, and how do factors such as infection, blocked glands, and hygiene contribute to their development?

Boils, abscesses and eye styes are bacterial infections that cause pus to collect under the surface of your skin. Your immune system usually eliminates the bad bacteria using a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil. However, if you consume too much sugar, the neutrophil often targets the sugar molecules instead of the bacteria, allowing an infection to develop.

***

## What are the underlying causes of urinary retention, and how do anatomical, neurological, and obstructive factors contribute to this condition?

Urinary retention is a condition in which you cannot empty all the urine from your bladder. Urinary retention can be acute (a sudden inability to urinate) or a chronic inability to completely empty the bladder of urine.

**Symptoms:**

* Inability to urinate
* Pain in your lower abdomen
* Urgent need to urinate without being able to empty the bladder fully
* Swelling of your lower abdomen

**Cause 1: Obstruction (due to fibroids or enlarged prostate)**

If you can’t empty your bowels there could be some obstruction, or blockage, in the bladder. It could be a fibroid (scar tissue) or result from an enlarged prostate.

**Cause 2: ANS dysfunction**

ANS stands for the autonomic nervous system. This system has to do with your general body response during periods of stress. It also relaxes your body and many of its organs during a rest period. ANS also affects your bladder function and nerves. If you have dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, you may have bladder problems including urine retention.

***

## What are the underlying factors contributing to adrenal fatigue?

**Cause #1: Chronic stress**

Chronic stress can cause your adrenal glands to work without rest at producing stress hormones (like cortisol). Over time, chronic stress causes adrenal glands to burn out and not function properly. Therefore, your body can’t handle stress effectively anymore because your cells become resistant to stress hormones being overproduced.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/treating-adrenal-fatigue-with-sleep-most-important-action-for-adrenal-fatigue-drberg)

**Cause #2: Low vitamin B1**

Vitamin B1 (thiamin) is vital for normal functioning of the nervous system and for regulating stress levels in the body. Low vitamin B1 can reduce your ability to handle physical and mental stress. If you are deficient in B1 your adrenal glands can eventually wear out, resulting in the adrenal fatigue symptoms mentioned above.

**Remedies:**

* Take vitamin B1
* nutritional yeast
* benfotiamine
* Avoid alcohol
* Avoid drinking too much coffee or tea
*   Avoid diuretics and antibiotics

**Other causes:**

* Too many carbs in the diet
* No exercise
* Too much caffeine
* Lack of salt (take sea salt)
* Sudden shock (surgery, loss of loved one, accident)
* Chronic pain in the body part (do acupressure)
* Chronic infection (improve immune strength)
*   Taking prednisone for a long time (stress medication)

## What are the underlying factors that contribute to sleep disturbances in individuals with insomnia?

You need enough melatonin to get to sleep and stay asleep. But, melatonin supplements may not be the best idea because you’re not fixing the root cause of your sleep problem. Melatonin comes from another hormone called serotonin—90% of the serotonin in your body is made with the help of your friendly bacteria.

Your friendly bacteria turns tryptophan into serotonin and then converts it to melatonin. But, you also need vitamin B6 to help with these conversions. If you have trouble sleeping, it’s important to focus on supporting your microbiome.

**Here are a few fantastic ways to support the microbiome so you can start sleeping better:**

• Take probiotics

• Take vitamin B6

• Consume kefir

• Consume fermented foods (sauerkraut or kimchi)

• Consume fiber from vegetables (unless you have a gut problem)

## What are the underlying factors that contribute to the development of dark circles under the eyes?

**Top causes of dark circles under the eyes:**

1\. Cortisol resistance

2\. Insulin resistance

**There are a few great natural remedies for dark circles under the eyes, but the effects are temporary. These remedies include:**

• Kojic acid

• Vitamin C

• Aloe vera

• Niacinamide

• Cucumber extract

How to get rid of dark circles under the eyes: • Reduce your stress • Exercise • Do physical work • Get more sleep • Take vitamin D3 • Take magnesium • Limit screen time • Reduce insulin (get on a low-carb diet and do intermittent fasting)

***

## What are the underlying factors that contribute to the development of depression?

There is no evidence that depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain involving serotonin. It has been found that SSRIs can temporarily help increase serotonin in the brain. However, drug trials have shown that these anti-depressants were almost indistinguishable from the placebo in treating depression. SSRIs come with a lot of side effects, including some serious ones involving the sex organs. Does depression cause body problems, or do body problems cause depression? While it may be a mixture, we’re going to focus on the body problems and deficiencies that could cause depression.

Potential causes of depression include:

1\. Insomnia

2\. Chronic fatigue

3\. Stress

4\. Nutritional deficiencies (vitamin D, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, magnesium, DHA)

5\. Lack of exercise

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary or medication changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## What are the underlying factors that contribute to the formation of gallstones?

Gallstones are really cholesterol stones. This situation isn’t really caused be consuming too much cholesterol. The real cause may be that you don’t have enough bile to break down cholesterol stones. Bile is made in the liver and is stored in the gallbladder. Bile helps you dissolve fats in your diet. A low bile situation is actually a symptom of something else.

Low bile could be a symptom of:

• Excess estrogen

• Excess cortisol

• Excess insulin

• Low-fat diets

• Constipation

To help dissolve the stones, you would want to increase your bile by pinpointing what’s causing the low bile situation and correcting your diet. In the meantime, bile salt also dissolves gallstones.

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## What are the underlying factors that may contribute to a child's overweight status?

**Consuming too many carbohydrates might be number two, but the number one reason is snacking.**

The problem with snacking is that you have various hormones that are secreted in your stomach and small intestine that will stimulate insulin after you eat. Snacking in-between the meals could keep insulin high. Insulin actually prevents the loss of fat, as well as causes the storage of fat.

**The most common snacks kids are fed:**

1\. Flavored yogurt—3.5oz has about 13g of sugar

2\. Popcorn—very high on the glycemic index

3\. Applesauce—very high on the glycemic index

4\. Energy bar—a granola bar could have 19g of net carbs

5\. Juice—very high on the glycemic index

6\. Crackers and peanut butter—can be very high on the glycemic index

7\. Apples—on average contain around 19g of sugar

**What you could do:**

• Don’t keep any snacks that are high in carbohydrates in the house.

• Make a transition to no snacking using healthier snacks first.

• Ideally, don’t give the child any snacks. Give them 3 nutrient-dense meals, with enough calories and healthy fats.

## What are the underlying reasons for stomach growling?

You may have stomach sounds or stomach growling when you’re hungry, but hunger is not what’s causing it. Something called the migrating motor complex is what causes stomach growling. This is a certain housekeeping condition in your body where it’s cleaning out debris (extra food particles).

One really important function of the migrating motor complex is that it can prevent SIBO. SIBO is a condition where you have too much bacteria in your small intestine. The majority of bacteria should be in the large intestine. When bacteria get into the small intestine, you’ll start to be robbed of nutrients. You could also start to experience a lot of bloating from fermentation going on in your small intestine.

**How to stop stomach growling:**

• Eating (but if you have SIBO eating could increase bloating)

• Increase bile salts

• Decrease stress

• Fix SIBO (increase bile and take betaine hydrochloride)

• Do intermittent fasting

## What are the underlying reasons that make it difficult for individuals to alleviate chronic stress?

Cortisol is a stress hormone that is made on the outside of the adrenal gland. Cortisol reacts to stress and helps to adapt the body to stress states. All stress is accumulative in the body, and as people experience stress (even though it tends to reduce after some time), it begins to accumulate inside the body as the adrenal gland only has the "ON" switch. What you need to do is manually apply the "OFF" switch to reduce cortisol levels.

**To help lower cortisol levels, you can use different acupressure or massage techniques to turn this switch "OFF."**

## What are the underlying root causes of inflammation in the body, and how do lifestyle, environmental, and dietary factors contribute to this condition?

**Common Causes of Inflammation:**

1\. Gluten and Food Allergies: Contribute to gut inflammation and leaky gut syndrome

2\. Ultra-processed Foods: Contain synthetic sugars and seed oils, promoting free-radical damage.

3\. Viruses: Trigger inflammatory conditions, worsened by stress and immune suppression.

4\. Insulin Resistance: Resulting from frequent carb consumption, affecting many

5\. Cortisol Deficiency: Chronic stress and medications like Prednisone lead to resistance.

6\. Old Injuries: Sedentary lifestyle and lack of movement contribute to chronic inflammation.

7\. Bile Duct Issues: Bile sludge buildup causes liver and shoulder pain.

8\. Excess Iron: Genetic issue more common in men.

9\. Hypoxia: Conditions like COPD and sleep apnea lead to oxygen deficiency

10\. Uric Acid: Linked to high fructose intake and hypertension.

**Remedies for Inflammation:**

\- Probiotics: Kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi.

\- Vitamin D3: Supports immune function and reduces inflammation.

\- Intermittent Fasting: Promotes cellular repair and reduces inflammation markers.

\- Vegetables and Salads: Cruciferous vegetables for anti-inflammatory benefits.

\- Keto and Carnivore Diets: Reduce carb-induced inflammation.

\- TUDCA: Supports liver function and bile flow.

\- Tocotrienols: Anti-inflammatory properties, support cardiovascular health.

\- Cold Therapy: Reduces inflammation and promotes recovery.

\- Exercise: Improves circulation and reduces chronic inflammation.

\- Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Found in cod liver oil, sardines, and salmon, known for anti-inflammatory effects.

These strategies help manage inflammation effectively through dietary changes, lifestyle adjustments, and targeted supplements.

## What are the unusual symptoms and signs of an iodine deficiency?

Many people have low iodine. You're likely iodine deficient unless you consume shellfish, seaweed, sea kelp, or vegetables grown on the coast. The level of iodine in your body really depends on the level of iodine in the food you eat and the soil it's grown in. If you're deficient in iodine, you could end up with a hypothyroid condition.

**Overlooked signs of an iodine deficiency:**

1\. Estrogen dominance. Iodine helps regulate estrogen and helps prevent estrogen dominance. It also supports detoxification.

2\. High cortisol levels. Iodine helps normalize cortisol levels.

3\. A hypothyroid condition. Hypothyroidism can cause the cholesterol in your body to be elevated but unusable for making vitamin D, cell membranes, and bile.

4\. Side effects when consuming soy products. Iodine helps buffer the estrogen effects of consuming soy products.

5\. Hashimoto's. You still need iodine if you have Hashimoto's, but not excess iodine. You may also need selenium, zinc, vitamin D, and myo-inositol.

## What are the various causes of gastritis, and how do factors such as infections, chronic use of pain relievers, and excessive alcohol consumption contribute to this condition?

**Gastritis Overview:**

**Definition:** Inflammation of the stomach lining, often chronic and caused by prolonged medication use or poor diet.

**Symptoms:**

\- Upper central abdominal pain

\- Bloating

\- Possible stomach ulcer

**Cause #1: H. pylori Infection:**

\- H. pylori virus destroys stomach mucus lining and lowers stomach acid, leading to gastritis.

\- Remedies include cabbage, cabbage juice, broccoli sprouts, sauerkraut, mastic gum, liquid probiotics, raw black seeds, and zinc carnosine.

**Other Causes:**

\- Chronic use of aspirin, steroids, or antacids

\- Chronic stress, inadequate sleep

\- High sugar and refined carb intake

**General Remedies:**

\- Consume high-quality foods

\- Avoid junk food

\- Consider intermittent fasting and the Healthy Keto® diet

\- Avoid betaine hydrochloride and apple cider vinegar

These approaches support stomach health and aid in managing gastritis by addressing underlying causes and promoting healing.

## What are the various causes of hearing loss, including genetic, environmental, and age-related factors, and how do they affect auditory function?

Your hearing function is dependent on your thyroid and iodine. Your thyroid gland regulates energy levels in your body, including those in your brain. Some of the brain parts that are responsible for hearing function require normal thyroid function for hearing to happen.

**Cause #1: Iodine deficiency**

Low levels of iodine can reduce the production of thyroid hormones and lead to dysfunction of the brain areas that control your hearing. Pregnant women commonly have iodine deficiencies, which can transmit to their infants--causing them to have hearing problems and other side effects.

## What are the various causes of infertility?

Inability to get pregnant can be rooted in nutritional deficiencies. If you consume enough of certain nutrients in your diet (not from synthetic sources) you can greatly increase your chances of getting pregnant.

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiencies**

There are certain nutrients that are needed for the female body to be able to get pregnant. Being deficient in those or consuming them from synthetic supplements can be a great barrier to your fertility.

Fat-soluble vitamins, specifically vitamins A, D and E, are very important for being able to get pregnant. These are the vitamins that can go through the fat layer of the cell and can go right into the DNA to start improving your health.

Trace minerals are the minerals that are needed in your body in very small amounts. Specifically, zinc and iodine can cause infertility if you are deficient in them.

If you are deficient in some of these nutrients, it can cause being infertile.

## What are the various causes of shortness of breath, and how do factors such as respiratory conditions, cardiovascular issues, and anxiety contribute to this symptom?

Shortness of breath means you can’t breathe well. Although some underlying disease can cause shortness of breath (dyspnea), diet and lifestyle choices may be at the root of this problem.

**Cause #1: Nutrient deficiencies**

Vitamins and minerals are essential for managing lung function, inflammation, muscle function, and heart activity. If you are deficient in vital nutrients, you can have a difficult time catching your breath. The main vitamin to pay attention to is B1. One of the main effects of a B1 deficiency is that you find you have breathing problems.

**Cause #2: pH imbalances**

A highly acidic body (acidosis) or a highly alkaline body (alkalosis) can cause you to feel out of breath or hungry for air. The solution is simple: normalize your pH (acidity-alkaline) level with the right diet.

## What are the various causes of vomiting, and how do factors such as infections, dietary issues, and medical conditions contribute to this symptom?

Nausea is discomfort and uneasiness that makes you want to throw up or vomit. Usually it’s a one-time event linked to something that doesn’t settle right in the stomach. Most of the time, vomiting is harmless, but if it’s recurring, it can be a sign of a more serious illness.

**Cause #1: Gallbladder problems / bile duct**

The gallbladder is a very important organ for your body as it stores bile. Bile is very important for our digestion and breakdown of fats. If you take something that your digestive system is not used to, this can overload your gallbladder ducts and cause confusion in your stomach. As a result you can feel nauseous.

**Other causes:**

* Motion sickness
* Food poisoning
* Chemotherapy
* Low blood sugar
* Medications/drugs
* Kidney stones
*   Pregnancy

## What are the various factors and conditions that can contribute to the development of colon polyps?

Colon polyps are abnormal tissue growths in your colon. Certain polyps have a high risk of colon cancer.

**Cause #1: Lack of friendly bacteria in the gut**

Colon polyps are caused by a lack of friendly bacteria in your gut. In particular, it’s a deficiency in lactobacillus. Lactobacillus helps lower your colon inflammation, tightens your colon wall, inhibits pathogens, reduces oxidation, and decreases the chance of cell mutation and cancer. This bacteria is commonly found in fermented and pickled vegetables.

## What are the various factors that can contribute to low testosterone levels?

Taking statins for high cholesterol can lower testosterone production due to reduced cholesterol levels in the body. Low-fat diets and liver damage can also contribute to testosterone deficiency, manifesting in symptoms like low libido and erectile dysfunction.

Surprisingly, high iron levels, often from supplements or fortified foods, can further disrupt testosterone balance. Accumulating excess iron, especially with conditions like hemochromatosis, can lead to joint inflammation, oxidative damage in arteries and the brain, fatigue, memory issues, and blood sugar problems.

To address high iron levels naturally:

\- Consider IP-6 (phytic acid) on an empty stomach and EDTA to chelate iron.

\- Incorporate green tea and intermittent fasting.

\- Donate blood regularly to reduce iron stores.

\- Avoid iron-rich foods and supplements.

\- Increase zinc intake to support iron regulation.

Consult with a healthcare provider to test iron levels and discuss appropriate management strategies.

## What are the various factors that can lead to a hoarse voice?

A hoarse voice can make it difficult to talk—your voice can sound raspy, airy, strained, or quiet. A lowered immune system or professional singing can stress your vocal cords, causing you to have a hoarse voice.

**Cause #1: Vocal tension**

You can develop a hoarse voice if you have excess stress on your vocal cords or throat. The key is to relieve the tension caused by this stress.

**Cause #2: Infection**

If your immune system is weak, you are susceptible to getting an infection. Some bacterial or viral infections can have the symptom of throat soreness. This can cause a hoarse voice.

**Cause #1: Hemorrhoids**

Hemorrhoid is a dilated, inflamed vein on the bottom part of your rectum or inside it that is painful and can cause bleeding. Consuming collinsonia root as well as natural vitamin C complex would help with this condition.

**Cause #2: Consuming beets**

If you consume a lot of beets they can give the appearance that the stool is bloody. This is only due to the beet’s red color.

## What are the various symptoms associated with prolonged anxiety?

Anxiety is an uncomfortable feeling of worry and fear. When there is a threat to your safety, your nervous system readies the body to either run away from the source of threat or to fight it. Although anxiety mechanisms are useful to the human body, prolonged anxiety can cause problems in many different ways.

## What are the various underlying causes and contributing factors associated with costochondritis?

**Cause #1: Vitamin D deficiency**

Vitamin D is a very important vitamin for your bones and for reducing inflammation across the body. Vitamin D deficiency can definitely cause bone pain and aching as well as costochondritis.

**Cause #2: Digestive problems**

Just behind the rib cage you have your digestive organs. If your gallbladder or liver are inflamed or enlarged, this can create pressure on your ribs resulting in chest pain and costochondritis. In such a case you could also have bloating and indigestion.

## What are the various underlying causes of anemia, including nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, genetic factors, and environmental influences?

1. **Low stomach acid**

Low stomach acid level can cause inability to absorb minerals from food, including iron, therefore causing anemia.

2. **Excessive menstruation**

This means too much estrogen in the body. Regulating estrogen levels (lowering them) can help.

**Cause #5: Vegan diet-related**

Some of the vegan diet foods have certain things like oxalates or phytates that block iron. This makes it difficult to have enough iron intake. Try to avoid eating too many refined grains.

## What are the vitamin deficiencies in Sciatica & Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?

**B Vitamins and Nerve Health**

Vitamins B1, B6, and B12 play crucial roles in maintaining a healthy nervous system. Deficiencies in these vitamins can contribute to painful nerve conditions.

**Vitamin B6**

* **Benefits:** Supports myelin sheath production, neurotransmitter synthesis, nerve integrity, and nerve signal transmission.
* **Deficiency causes:** Inappropriate B6 supplements, gut inflammation, digestive diseases, age, medications, alcohol, birth control, genetics, smoking, diabetes, and excessive coffee.
* **Important Note:** Choose the active form, pyridoxal-5-phosphate (P5P).

**Vitamin B12**

* **Benefits:** Supports nerve regeneration, myelin production, and nerve growth factors.
* **Deficiency causes:** Genetics, lack of animal products, low stomach acid, excess folic acid, alcohol, diabetes, malabsorption, and birth control.
* **Important Note:** Choose the natural form, methylcobalamin.

**Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)**

* **Benefits:** Supports blood flow to nerves and helps manage diabetes complications.
* **Deficiency causes:** Diabetes, prediabetes, insulin resistance, excessive coffee/tea.
* **Important Note:** Choose the fat-soluble form, benfotiamine.

## What are two primary causes of coronary heart disease?

This is my opinion and the coronary arteries are the main artery that supplies blood flow to the heart muscle.

**There are 2 controlling factors, one is adrenaline.** It does an interesting thing - it causes vasodilation of this artery despite causing vasoconstriction to all other vessels. Lacking oxygen can cause a cramp in your heart muscle - this is caused by stress.

**The secondary problem is clogged arteries.** It's the high sugars and refined carbs that cause insulin that then increases cholesterol to come in and heal the damage causing a clogged artery. If you consumed saturated fats and avoid refined sugars, it will not clog your arteries.

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## What biological, environmental, and genetic factors contribute to the development of allergies?

Allergic responses occur when the immune system has a hyperreaction to common and uncommon substances, which cause excess inflammation and many other symptoms.

**Cause: Low stomach acidity**

A low-acid stomach can create digestive problems. With low stomach acid some proteins end up undigested, resulting in your immune system attacking it inappropriately. This will cause hypersensitivity and allergic reactions.

Also, overgrowth of bad bacteria can cause increased intolerance to allergens.Acidifying the stomach can reduce the overgrowth of bad bacteria.

## What can be done for bald patches when growing a beard?

When addressing bald patches in a beard, it's essential to focus on promoting overall hair growth and health from within. Here are some strategies that can be inferred from the context provided:

1. **Nutrient-Rich Diet**: Ensure your diet is rich in essential vitamins and minerals that support hair growth. This includes foods high in biotin (vitamin B7), zinc, iron, and vitamins A and D. These nutrients are crucial for promoting healthy hair follicles and can aid in filling in bald patches over time.
2. **Herbal Supplements**: Consider incorporating herbal supplements known for supporting hair growth. For example, pumpkin seed oil, green tea extract, and nettle root have been highlighted for their potential to block DHT (Dihydrotestosterone), a hormone associated with hair loss. Applying green tea extract topically to the scalp or beard area might also be beneficial due to its compounds that can inhibit DHT.
3. **Stress Management**: High levels of stress can negatively impact hair growth, leading to hair thinning and bald patches. Engaging in stress-reduction techniques such as exercise, meditation, or yoga can help manage stress levels, potentially improving hair growth.
4. **Topical Treatments**: While the focus is on internal solutions, certain topical treatments might offer additional benefits. Essential oils like lavender, rosemary, and cedarwood oil have been mentioned for their ability to reduce scalp inflammation, stimulate blood circulation, and balance sebum production, which could be beneficial when applied to bald patches in the beard.
5. **Consult a Professional**: If your bald patches are a significant concern or you suspect an underlying condition like alopecia areata (an autoimmune disorder causing patchy hair loss), consulting with a healthcare professional or dermatologist is advisable. They can provide personalized advice and potential treatment options tailored to your specific situation.

## What can help with xantomas?

To help with xanthomas, the following recommendations are provided:

1. **Niacin**:
   * Take 500 milligrams of extended-release niacin two to three times a day.
   * Niacin is one of the most potent ways to lower cholesterol.
2. **Exercise**:
   * Exercise daily, especially if you have high triglycerides, as it helps burn off extra triglycerides in the bloodstream.
3. **Dietary Changes**:
   * Consume a good portion of your protein from fish or seafood high in omega-3 fatty acids.
   * Include huge salads in your diet, around seven to ten cups daily.
   * Add walnuts to your salads for their omega-3 fatty acid precursors.
   * Use extra virgin olive oil with garlic on your salads.
4. **Supplements**:
   * Choline: Helps prevent fatty liver and reduce cholesterol.
   * TUDCA (a specialized type of bile salt): Helps with the flow of cholesterol and reduces LDL cholesterol.
   * Red yeast rice extract: Acts as a natural version of a statin and is influential in lowering cholesterol.
5. **Healthy Ketogenic Diet**:
   * Follow a ketogenic diet with a twist by consuming fat that comes with the protein, rather than adding extra fat.

These steps can assist in managing and potentially reducing xanthomas by addressing the underlying cholesterol and triglyceride buildup.

Always consult your medical healthcare provider before starting any new supplement or protocol to address a medical condition.

## What can I do for dermatitis and eczema?

Often, skin issues may indicate underlying gut inflammation or liver involvement, potentially linked to dysbiosis—a microbial imbalance in the gut flora. Addressing this imbalance with probiotics, prebiotics, and foods like sauerkraut and kefir can be beneficial. Vitamin D supplementation is also important. Consider previous antibiotic use or gut infections as potential contributors to these issues. Professional guidance can help target these underlying causes effectively.

***

## What can I do for dry skin?

I would definitely start with the omega-3 fatty acids for the skin. That is the key to prevent dry skin. It's not necessarily hydration with water. It is oils. So you need cod liver oil. And that would help your skin greatly. Of course, you can also have dry skin if you're lacking the B vitamins. You'd want nutritional yeast for that. Go ahead and try those two things and see if you can actually shed less skin.

***

## What can I do for hyperlipidemia?

There's some natural things that you can do, for sure. Vitamin B3 in the form of niacin would be very potent. The other thing would be very potent that acts like statin, but with less side effects is the red yeast extract, very beneficial. You can also do natokinase, which will also help lower your cholesterol, and even sometimes the TUDCA can do it as well.

***

## What can I do for prostate issues?

For individuals experiencing prostate issues, it is important to consider the potential impact of dairy consumption. Dairy products can elevate hormonal levels, including estrogen, which may contribute to prostate enlargement. Reducing or eliminating dairy, particularly milk and certain cheeses, could alleviate some symptoms.

Additionally, many men report frequent nighttime urination, often attributed to prostate enlargement. However, implementing intermittent fasting and reducing carbohydrate intake—particularly by avoiding late-night snacking—can significantly improve urinary retention. Transitioning to two meals or even one meal per day may enable better bladder control, allowing for uninterrupted sleep. This shift in dietary habits may reveal that the underlying issue is related to insulin resistance rather than solely a prostate condition.

***

## What can I do for sweet taste in mouth?

For many symptoms, the underlying issue is often rooted in poor dietary habits. Without a proper diet, remedies may prove ineffective, as they typically address symptoms rather than the root cause. Inadequate nutrition can both mask and exacerbate a variety of symptoms. Therefore, the key is to first establish a healthy diet. Once foundational eating habits are corrected, many symptoms may resolve on their own, making it easier to address any remaining issues.

## What causes a stinky odor after urination?

If you are not on a ketogenic diet and you’re not doing intermittent fasting, but you’re getting a stinky urine odor, it could be a urinary tract infection, liver damage, eating the wrong foods, or not having enough vegetables.

If you are on a keto diet, it could also be ketones that aren’t being burned. This often happens if you’re still adapting to keto. Keto adaptation can take several weeks. Over time, you will burn those ketones, and they won’t cause an odor.

If you have an ammonia smell, it could be that you’re consuming too much protein, or you have liver damage.

**Here’s what you can do for a strong urine odor:**

1\. Liver support - consume plenty of healthy vegetables (beet tops and dandelion greens)

2\. Fluids - drink plenty of water throughout the day

3\. Adjust proteins - lower your protein (3-6 oz is plenty)

4\. Chlorophyll - wheatgrass juice powder is a great source of chlorophyll

## What causes arterial calcification to occur, leading to a bone-like transformation, and what are the associated health implications?

The body becomes more calcified with age. But, our goal is to keep the bones calcified and the other tissues from becoming calcified. A CAC test is a great way to determine if you have calcium in your arteries.

There are two types of cells in your bones. Osteoblasts are cells that build bone, and osteoclasts break down bones. If there are too many osteoblasts in your arteries, the arteries can start turning to bone. There are stem cells in the inner tissue of the arteries that have the potential to turn into a certain type of cell, depending on what the body needs.

If someone is developing bone tissue in their arteries, there is a problem with the differentiation of these stem cells—they’re turning into the wrong thing. Sufficient amounts of vitamin K2 may help inhibit calcification. Vitamin K2 helps keep calcium out of the arteries and in the bones, making the bones strong. Your good bacteria make vitamin K2.

***

## What causes cataracts? (New video)

All it takes is a small amount of oxidative stress to the eye's lens to develop a cataract. A healthy lens is composed of an organized protein called crystallin. When this tissue becomes damaged, it is not replaced. Glycation can damage the lens of the eye. It results from sugar connecting to a protein and then becoming stuck and unusable to the body. Steroids like Prednisone can also increase the risk of cataracts.

Not all surgeries can eliminate cataracts, and they can come with complications. According to “The Cataract Cure” by Dr. Marios Kyriazis, there is a safe, effective remedy for cataracts. Carnosine is a unique compound that can penetrate the lens of the eye and help with cataracts. Carnosine is a potent antioxidant that can dissolve damaged proteins. It can also activate your own antioxidants. NAC (n-acetyl carnosine) eye drops are one of the best remedies for cataracts.

The same group of scientists who performed the rabbit studies also tested NAC on humans. They selected 49 volunteers with an average age of 65 who had established age-related cataracts. After 6 months, researchers found that:

•41% of people presented a significant reduction of clouding in the lens

•90% showed a gradual improvement in vision

•89% showed up to a 100% improvement in sensitivity to glare

NAC for cataracts must be used for at least 3 to 5 months. Antioxidants such as those found in onions, egg yolks, leafy greens, and grass-fed red meat can protect you against cataracts. Vitamin A is vital for eye health and can be found in cod liver oil and grass-fed liver. B vitamins, especially B2, B6, and folate, are also essential.

## What causes dizziness upon standing?

When you get dizzy from standing up, it could be due to several factors. Here are some potential causes and solutions based on the provided context:

1. **Low Blood Pressure**:
   * **Solution**: Increase your salt intake, specifically sea salt, to help maintain blood pressure levels.
2. **Adrenal Weakness**:
   * **Solution**: Perform a Raglin test to check for adrenal fatigue. This involves:
     * Lay down for 3 minutes and check your blood pressure.
     * Stand up and immediately recheck your blood pressure.
     * If the systolic (top) number drops significantly, it may indicate weak adrenals.
   * **Additional Information**: The adrenal glands help the body adapt to stress, including positional changes like standing up. If the adrenals are weak, they may not be able to push the blood effectively, leading to dizziness.
3. **Adapting to Stress**:
   * **Solution**: Ensure your body is adapting well to stress. If your systolic blood pressure does not increase by 6 to 10 points when you stand up, it may indicate an issue with your adrenal glands.

For more detailed information, refer to Dr. Berg's dizziness and adrenal health resources.

## What causes dyspareunia?

This condition can cause pain during intercourse, pelvic exams, and horse riding, or while inserting a tampon or sitting too long. My opinion is that this condition is typically caused by oxalates in the vaginal area. Oxalates can form crystals that can look like razor blades and are behind other conditions, as well, like kidney stones and gout. Thankfully, there are natural remedies for dyspareunia and certain foods that may be helpful. You may also want to avoid high-oxalate foods for a while to help determine if oxalates could be involved.

## What causes fever and what are some natural remedies to handle it?

Fever is an increased body temperature. It is caused by your immune system as a way to fight internal infections. Let’s look at the common causes of fever and their remedies.

Symptoms

* High temperature
* Sweating
* Chills and shivering
* Headache
* Muscle aches
* Loss of appetite
* Irritability
* Dehydration
* General weakness

**Cause #1: Infection**

If your body is undergoing a viral or bacterial infection, this can trigger your immune system to create fever. Fever is a mechanism that helps your body to fight the harmful infection.

The solution would not be to suppress your fever with medication, but rather to strengthen your immune system and counter the virus with natural antibiotics. Fasting is one of the best ways to boost your immune system, and that will also speed up the process of getting your body back to normal.

**Cause #2: An autoimmune condition**

An autoimmune condition means your immune system is attacking your own healthy body cells. This can create inflammation and a fever as a result. Usually this stems from some kind of immune system confusion prior to that. Thus, strengthening your immune system as well as lowering the inflammation should help.

**Cause #3: Inflammatory condition**

If you have inflammation in some area of your body that is not going away, this in itself can cause a higher body temperature. Consuming foods that are inflammatory can cause this condition as well. The solution would be to reduce the inflammation.

## What causes hives and itchiness-urticaria?

**Understanding Itchiness, Hives, and Bile Salts**

Itchiness and hives can sometimes be linked to low bile salt levels. Here's why:

* **Bile's Role in Digestion:** Your liver produces bile, which is stored and concentrated in your gallbladder. When you eat, your gallbladder releases bile into your small intestine. Bile works with enzymes to break down fats and absorb essential vitamins and fatty acids from your food.
* **Bile Release and Stomach Acid:** Adequate stomach acid (a specific pH level) is needed to trigger bile release.

**Conditions Linked to Itchiness, Hives, and Low Bile Salts:**

* **Acid Reflux and GERD:** These digestive issues can interfere with proper bile release.
* **Gallbladder Removal:** Without a gallbladder to store bile, its release could be disrupted.
* **Liver Dysfunction:** Liver problems can impair bile production.
* **High Cholesterol and Gallbladder Stones:** These conditions may affect bile flow and function.

**Potential Remedies for Low Bile Salts:**

* **Purified Bile Salts:** Bile Salt Supplements
* **Healthy Ketosis and Intermittent Fasting:** These dietary approaches should be discussed with a healthcare professional to see if they could improve bile production and function.

***

## What causes hypertension?

Ninety percent of hypertension is considered essential, which means the cause is unknown. However, I believe it's likely linked to vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is vital in supporting and protecting the endothelial layer of your arteries. The benefits of vitamin D for your arteries include:

1\. Potent anti-inflammatory effects

2\. Potent antioxidant effects

3\. Increased nitric oxide

Nitric oxide keeps the arteries in a state of vasodilation and relaxation. Without enough nitric oxide, the arteries become tight, and blood pressure rises. When the endothelial layer of the artery becomes dysfunctional, you no longer produce nitric oxide. You won't absorb much calcium if you don't have enough vitamin D. This can cause your parathyroid hormone to increase to remove calcium from the bone and put it into the blood. If you are chronically low in vitamin D, the parathyroid hormone will continue to rob calcium from the bone, creating osteoporosis. Many doctors do not recommend large doses of vitamin D in fear of vitamin D toxicity. Clinical data does not support vitamin D toxicity! Dr. Bruce Hollis, a pioneer in vitamin D research, has personally never seen a case.

Vitamin K2 can help remove calcium from the arteries and put it into the teeth and bones. Magnesium regulates excess calcium and helps to prevent cardiovascular problems. Vitamin D protects your arteries by decreasing inflammation and supporting the vascular cells. Vitamin D, magnesium, and K2 can help prevent calcium from developing in the wrong places, helping to prevent high blood pressure. Aim for 30,000 IU of vitamin D daily if you have high blood pressure.

## What causes palpitations after eating?

Palpitations, irregular heartbeats such as skipped or extra beats, can stem from various causes related to cardiac function:

1\. **Digestive Issues (Gallbladder Problems)**: Address with intermittent fasting and avoiding refined carbs and vegetable oils, opting for a healthy keto diet.

2\. **Alkalinity**: Manage through healthy keto practices and incorporating apple cider vinegar to balance pH levels.

3\. **Low Potassium**: Causes include diuretics, diarrhea, antacids, and insufficient dietary intake of potassium-rich foods (7-10 cups of vegetables daily).

Managing these factors can help alleviate palpitations and promote heart health.

## What causes postmenopausal osteoporosis?

A lot of women who go through menopause end up having bone loss. What causes this condition, and what can you do about it? There are two types of cells in the bone:

• Osteoclasts – breaks down bone

• Osteoblasts – builds bone

A decrease in estrogen after menopause causes stimulation in osteoclasts and a decrease in osteoblasts. Cortisol is a very destructive hormone to your bones. An increase in cortisol will stimulate osteoclasts and inhibit osteoblasts.

The female hormones, estrogen, and progesterone are produced by the ovary and the adrenals. When you go through menopause, and the adrenals are not strong enough to back up these hormones, you will end up with even less estrogen and more cortisol.

**What you can do to support your bone health after menopause:**

1\. Support your adrenals (decrease stress, exercise, and increase vitamin D)

2\. Build bone (calcium citrate, magnesium, boron, trace minerals, vitamins D3 and K2)

3\. Dairy (grass-fed)

## What causes skin tags and moles, and how do factors such as genetics, friction, and sun exposure contribute to their development?

It’s basically a really tiny benign tumor, and it’s triggered by growth factor, which is triggered by insulin. This is why, in some cases, diabetics and prediabetics start getting skin tags around their neck or armpits.

Insulin is the hormone that regulates blood sugars. But, if you continually eat sugar, or you eat too frequently, you can raise insulin to the point where you have insulin resistance. Now, you can have too much insulin. Insulin is anabolic and makes things grow, so it can start causing skin tags.

## What common factors or habits might be preventing my metabolism from increasing?

Here are the top mistakes dieters make:

1\. Misunderstanding Metabolism: Trying to boost metabolism can lead to burnout. A slower metabolism often reflects efficiency rather than dysfunction.

2\. Low-Calorie Diets: Long-term low-calorie diets can hinder metabolism and lead to weight regain.

3\. Frequent Eating: Eating frequently can spike insulin levels, hindering fat burning. Opt for quality over quantity in meals.

4\. Overtraining: Excessive exercise without adequate recovery prevents effective fat burning.

5\. Processed Protein Shakes: Low-quality protein shakes high in refined ingredients and insulin-raising factors can hinder weight loss. Opt for high-quality animal proteins instead.

Focus on improving overall health to facilitate sustainable weight loss, including adopting a ketogenic diet to shift to fat metabolism and incorporating high-intensity interval training with adequate recovery, while managing stress and prioritizing sleep.

## What common mistakes should be avoided when dealing with acne to prevent worsening the condition and promote clearer skin?

**The biggest mistake you can make when you're trying to get rid of your acne is trying to wash the acne off of your face.** Blackheads and acne are not dirt that you can simply wash off. When you use detergents, cleansers, alcohol wipes, antibacterial creams, you are literally destroying your microbiome on the surface of your skin.

Your skin contains millions of microbes that act as a barrier, which is involved in your immune system. When you remove that layer of good bacteria, you lose the bacterial diversity. In turn, this increases the inflammation on the skin—it can even cause acne.

This is also why one of the side effects of antibiotics is acne. Acne involves the sebaceous glands. These glands secrete an oil called sebum. Acne is essentially inflammation of these glands with excess amounts of sebum as well as pus and bacteria formation.

**Acne comes from high levels of androgens, which are hormones.** Your androgen levels spike when you're a teenager. In turn, this causes a problem with your sebaceous glands. What causes excess levels of androgens? Insulin. High levels of insulin can throw off your hormone balance. The cause of high insulin is a high-carb diet.

**If you cut the carbs out, the acne will go away. The healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting are the two best ways to promote healthy insulin levels. Try going keto, and let me know how that works for you in the comments below.**

## What comprehensive regimen would be beneficial for managing gastritis and acid reflux symptoms effectively?

You may find that you can tolerate cabbage-based foods, such as cabbage juice, steamed cabbage, and possibly sauerkraut or coleslaw. Cabbage contains nutrients beneficial for gastritis and ulcers, which could support your healing process.

I recommend starting zinc carnosine immediately, as it can aid in healing. Additionally, considering a carnivore diet—potentially combined with cabbage—may help improve gut health.

It's also worth exploring the possibility of H. pylori involvement, which can affect stomach acidity. Healing your stomach and microbiome should be the priority, so a good probiotic is advisable. Once your gut is healed, you can focus on acidifying it, but that should not be your first step at this stage.

## What comprehensive strategies can I consider to manage and alleviate the symptoms of sciatica?

The sciatic nerve, the body's largest nerve, originates from the lower lumbar and sacral regions and extends down the leg. Sciatica typically arises from pinching in the lumbar area, potentially due to a protruded disc or scar tissue.

To alleviate symptoms, maintain an inward curve in your lower back using lumbar support or a cushion. Avoid stretching the hamstring on the affected side; instead, focus on stretching the thigh muscle. Prolonged sitting or driving can exacerbate sciatica, so minimize these activities. Additionally, consider addressing potential vitamin deficiencies.

***

## What comprehensive strategies can I implement to manage a connective tissue disease effectively?

There are several genetic factors and variations that can contribute to weakened collagen and connective tissue. In such cases, it's crucial to avoid overtraining and prioritize recovery. Incorporating bone broth and collagen powder into your diet can be beneficial, as both support connective tissue health.

Additionally, ensure that your vitamin C intake comes from whole food sources, as vitamin C acts as a vital cofactor for collagen synthesis. This combination can help enhance the integrity of your connective tissues and promote overall recovery.

## What conditions or factors can foamy urine indicate?

Foamy urine can indicate excessive protein intake. Consider reducing your protein consumption and monitor if the foaminess subsides. If the condition persists, consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation.

***

## What constitutes a mood disorder?

Cholesterol serves as a crucial precursor for hormones like estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol, essential for mood and overall well-being. Low cholesterol levels, often due to low-fat diets or statin drugs, can lead to hormonal imbalances and depression. Adequate cholesterol intake from animal foods, egg yolks, and butter is vital, especially for vegetarians who may struggle to obtain sufficient cholesterol from plant-based sources. Supporting gallbladder health with purified bile salts can aid in cholesterol availability for hormone production.

## What could account for fluctuating iodine levels in the body?

When evaluating iodine levels, blood tests may not offer a comprehensive assessment as iodine is primarily stored in the thyroid gland, not freely circulating in the bloodstream. A more precise method involves a skin test using a 2% iodine solution, available at pharmacies:

\- Apply a small amount of iodine solution to the skin on your arm or thigh.

\- Cover with a band-aid and leave for 24 hours.

\- Check the color of the iodine spot after 24 hours. Fading or disappearance suggests potential iodine deficiency, indicating absorption by the body. Unchanged color suggests sufficient iodine levels.

This method provides a direct evaluation of iodine absorption, offering a clearer indication of iodine status compared to blood tests alone. Consulting a healthcare provider is advisable for interpretation and guidance based on test results.

***

## What could be causing diarrhea while following a carnivore diet?

While following a carnivore diet can be beneficial for some, persistent diarrhea may indicate that your gut microbiota is not being adequately supported. Microbes primarily thrive on fiber from vegetables, which serves as their main fuel source and acts as a prebiotic. While animal products can provide some nutrients, they do not fulfill the prebiotic role.

If you are on a carnivore diet due to existing gut issues, it’s crucial to ensure you’re approaching it correctly. Simply consuming meat may not be sufficient. Incorporating a variety of animal products, such as eggs, fish, organ meats, and shellfish, can provide a broader range of nutrients and support gut health more effectively.

***

## What could be the cause of brown urine?

It sounds like a deeper evaluation may be necessary to uncover the underlying issues. I plan to create a video on this topic.

One area of particular interest to me is metabolomics, a rapidly emerging field that studies metabolites—the end products of various biochemical processes in the body. Metabolomic testing analyzes biomarkers in urine or blood to provide insights into your body’s biochemistry, going beyond traditional metrics. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of biochemical pathways, including identifying blockages, excessive activity, or toxic compounds.

Unfortunately, conventional medicine often tends to focus on a diagnostic-and-treatment model that may overlook these complexities. In many cases, patients receive multiple medications without a clear understanding of the underlying biochemical issues at play. It's concerning to see individuals, even young ones, prescribed numerous drugs without addressing the root causes of their health problems. Moreover, dietary factors are often neglected in this process. Understanding the intricate relationships within biochemistry could lead to more effective solutions.

***

## What could be the possible reasons for a decrease in urination frequency?

Decreased urination frequency can stem from various factors such as electrolyte imbalance, salt intake, and dietary habits, including carbohydrate consumption. Ensuring adequate hydration involves balancing salts and electrolytes alongside water intake. Different eating plans, like keto, can affect fluid retention and electrolyte levels, influencing urinary patterns.

***

## What could be the reasons for constantly feeling cold?

If you’re following a ketogenic diet and find yourself feeling cold, it may be beneficial to increase your intake of vitamin B1 (thiamine). B1 plays a role in temperature regulation and can help improve your tolerance to extreme temperatures. For example, if you struggle with ice bath therapy due to discomfort, this could indicate a deficiency in B1.

Similarly, if you find yourself overheating easily when exposed to sunlight, it may also suggest a B1 deficiency. Additionally, incorporating iodine from sources like sea kelp could be beneficial. Together, these two nutrients may support better thermal regulation.

***

## What could be the reasons for experiencing darker skin on your joints?

Darkening of the skin on joints can be indicative of blood sugar imbalances or insulin resistance, often associated with diabetes. This condition can lead to darker pigmentation in skin folds and tissues. If the pigmentation is not due to blood sugar issues, using a vitamin C serum may help improve skin appearance by addressing age spots, pigmentation, and sun damage.

***

## What could be the underlying causes of significant abdominal distension or a large belly that is not attributed to excess fat?

**This type of protruded stomach is caused by a damaged liver. The damaged liver is causing leakage of fluid and accumulation of a protein fluid in the abdominal cavity.**

With this condition, there is a replacement of the normal healthy liver cells with fibrous scar tissue, and you end up losing the function of the liver cells. Cirrhosis doesn't happen overnight. It takes years to develop. This could happen from consuming alcohol, or from years of poor eating. It usually starts with inflammation, and typically the person will have a fatty liver as well. The inflammation is part of an immune response, and the body heals with scar tissue.

Typically, what's done medically, is the lower the person's sodium, and put them on diuretics.

**Here are a few natural things you can do:**

1\. Lower your carbohydrates

2\. Stop consuming alcohol

3\. Consume moderate protein and fat

4\. Consume cruciferous vegetables

5\. Intermittent fasting

6\. Give it time (3 years)

***

## What could be the underlying reasons for experiencing itchiness on my face?

Pruritus is the medical term for itchiness, and there can be several underlying causes. One possibility is an issue with bile flow, where bile ducts become backed up, leading to the accumulation of bile salts in the bloodstream and subsequently causing skin irritation. In such cases, a supplement called TUDCA may help alleviate the problem.

Another potential cause of facial itchiness is an imbalance in the skin's microbial flora. Over-cleansing or using harsh detergents and soaps can disrupt the skin's microbiome, leading to irritation, rashes, or itchiness. It's important to approach skin cleansing gently and avoid excessive use of products that can compromise the skin's natural balance.

***

## What could be the underlying reasons for experiencing persistent hunger and a burning sensation following meals?

Persistent hunger and post-meal burning sensations can indicate underlying issues with digestion and metabolism. Here’s a professional approach to address these symptoms:

1\. **Sugar and Carbohydrate Reduction**: Reduce sugar and carbohydrate intake significantly, aiming for minimal to support better blood sugar control.

2\. **Consider Carnivore Diet**: Switching to a carnivore diet can be beneficial, especially if there are gut inflammation issues. This approach minimizes potential triggers and promotes digestive healing.

3\. **Intermittent Fasting**: Implement intermittent fasting to enhance fat metabolism and reduce hunger by promoting ketosis.

4\. **Professional Guidance**: Seek guidance from a healthcare provider or nutritionist to tailor these strategies to your specific needs and health condition.

By optimizing diet through low-carb approaches like carnivore diet and intermittent fasting, individuals can potentially alleviate constant hunger and digestive discomfort effectively.

***

## What could cause foot pain in a child?

Foot pain in children can often be linked to various factors, including structural issues and vitamin deficiencies, notably vitamin D. Vitamin D is essential for bone and connective tissue formation during childhood, and its deficiency can impair skeletal development and lead to discomfort. Ensuring adequate vitamin D through sunlight exposure, dietary intake, or supplements is crucial to support healthy bones and alleviate growing pains in children. Consulting a pediatrician for tailored advice on vitamin D supplementation is recommended to optimize skeletal health.

***

## What could explain experiencing low cortisol symptoms despite having high cortisol levels?

High levels of cortisol mobilize a tremendous amount of sugar in the body. There is a condition called cortisol resistance where you have the adrenal gland that makes cortisol that sends a signal to the receptor, but the receptor is downgraded and resistive which causes to not having the return communication to the gland.

There will then be certain parts of the body that are completely deprived of cortisol and other parts of the body that have way too much cortisol. This is the reason why you can have a combination of both low and high cortisol symptoms.

## What dietary changes should I consider with bone metastasis, breast cancer, and coronary artery disease?

I believe the most important priority should be addressing the cancer itself. I recommend reviewing my latest videos on this topic, as they contain valuable information based on recent research. Additionally, I provide a downloadable resource that outlines a comprehensive approach based on this research.

**Please consult with your healthcare provider before implementing any recommendations.**

***

## What dietary changes should I make to better fat absorption if I don't have a gallbladder?

**Dietary Adjustments**

\- MCTs: Use grass-fed butter, coconut oil, and full-fat yogurt.

\- Healthy Fats: Eat avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish. Avoid trans fats and limit saturated fats.

\- Include Fat: Essential for hormones and cell function. Focus on unsaturated fats and MCTs.

**Eating Tips**

\- Fasting: Reduces bile demands and digestive stress.

\- Fiber: Eat vegetables and nuts to aid digestion.

**Supplements**

\- Bile Salts: Help break down fats.

**- Lipase Enzymes: Enhance fat digestion.**

\- Vitamins A, D, E, K: Supplement if needed.

**Managing Fat Absorption**

Make careful dietary choices and consider supplements to manage fat absorption post-gallbladder removal. Consult your healthcare provider for tailored advice.

***

## What dietary choices can be beneficial for individuals with Parkinson’s disease?

There are proteins in the brain that can protect it against the oxidation that can lead to degenerative diseases. But there is also a protein in the brain that inhibits these protective proteins. Fortunately a compound called farnesol can deactivate the protein that inhibits the protective proteins. This allows the protective proteins to help prevent or slow down Parkinson’s disease and other degenerative diseases. Farnesol is in certain types of foods.

The best foods containing farnesol for Parkinson’s disease:

* Berries
* Vegetables (especially tomatoes, which are OK in moderate amounts on keto)
* Herbs (lemongrass, chamomile, rose and musk)
* Essential oils (citronella)

_**Please keep in mind that the above information is not a medical advice. You should consult with your doctor first before making any dietary changes.**_

## What dietary strategies should an individual with hyperthyroidism consider to manage their condition?

For someone with hyperthyroidism, I recommend a healthy version of the ketogenic diet with a few adjustments. Increase your intake of vitamin B1 and vitamin D3, as hyperthyroidism is often autoimmune-related. Avoid bile salts, as they can accelerate thyroid function, and steer clear of iodine or sea kelp. These general tips can help manage hyperthyroidism effectively.

***

## What distinguishes insulin resistance from prediabetes?

Insulin resistance is a condition where cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to higher blood glucose levels over time. It precedes and often accompanies prediabetes, which is characterized by early signs of pancreatic insulin production decline and slightly elevated blood sugar levels. Prediabetes is a symptom of insulin resistance, indicating a progression towards diabetes if not managed.

## What does a stomach ulcer feel like?

A stomach ulcer can feel like a burning or gnawing pain, especially on an empty stomach. Some people with ulcers do not have any pain at all.

***

## What does microflora consist of and how can I support it?

The large intestine is home to a vast and diverse community of microorganisms, collectively known as the gut microbiota. These microbes play a crucial role in our overall health, and one of their primary functions is to ferment the fiber that our bodies cannot digest on their own.

The fiber passes through the small intestine largely undigested when we consume fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

Once it reaches the large intestine, the resident microbes get to work, fermenting the fiber and producing beneficial compounds like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).

These SCFAs, particularly butyrate, serve as an energy source for the cells lining the colon and have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and potentially cancer-preventive properties.

In addition to fermenting fiber, the large intestine is responsible for absorbing water, electrolytes, and some of the vitamins produced by the gut bacteria, such as vitamin K and certain B vitamins.

This process helps to maintain proper hydration and electrolyte balance in the body, while also ensuring that we benefit from the nutrients synthesized by our microbial allies.

### **From Digestion to Absorption**

The journey of food through our digestive tract is a complex and fascinating process, involving multiple organs working together to break down, absorb, and eliminate waste.

Let's take a closer look at how this process unfolds, from the moment we take a bite to the point where nutrients are absorbed and waste is formed.

## What does the presence of belly fat indicate about an individual's health, and what factors contribute to its accumulation?

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/belly-fat-is-merely-a-symptom)

**For you to have a big belly, you first have to have a fatty liver.** The liver becomes fatty due to consuming too many carbs, which turn to fat in the liver and around the organs. Eventually, the fat from the liver will spill over into other organs. All of this comes from a high-carb diet as well as frequent eating.

In many cases, people don't associate their belly fat with any other health problems. At least, initially. They may not even see a high blood sugar problem for a few decades. This is because insulin is taking care of the blood sugar levels. But, doctors don't typically test insulin levels, so they won't see that your insulin is too high and is leading to a blood sugar problem.

**You probably won't know you have a fatty liver.** You'll just see that you have a large belly. But, as the years go on, you can develop diabetes. The deeper cause of insulin resistance is really a fatty liver. The liver can't function right, and everything starts backing up. But, a high-carb diet is what's really behind all of this.

**Other symptoms of high blood sugar and high insulin:**

• Frequent urination

• Fatigue

• Sleep apnea

• A weakened immune system

• Arthritis

• Cravings

• Metabolic syndrome (high blood pressure, heart disease, fatty liver diabetes type 2)

All of these things, plus the belly fat, are coming from the same things: a high carb diet, high blood glucose, and high insulin. But, the good news is that the Healthy Keto diet and intermittent fasting may help.

## What effective strategies and approaches can be employed to address feelings of weakness?

Weakness in simple words means lack of energy. Additional symptoms of weakness can include fatigue, feeling tired, etc. If you have any of the above symptoms, let’s find and remedy the most common causes for weakness.

**Cause 1: High-carb diet**

When you are on a high-carb diet you may often feel weak and tired. The reason behind this is that when you consume carbs, your blood sugar goes high. Although you may feel energetic, the feeling will go away very fast. Your body will produce insulin, which in its turn will lower the blood sugar, causing you to crave food and feel weak.

Additionally, consuming sugar in general will instantly make your body weaker! You can watch this video and try the experiment.

**Cause 2: Stress**

If you have chronic stress, it can wear your body out. Lack of sleep or vitamin B1 deficiency can lead to poor tolerance of stress and the inability of stress-regulating organs to work properly. These can definitely cause weakness.

***

## What effective strategies and lifestyle modifications can be implemented to prevent complications associated with diabetes?

High blood glucose impacts multiple tissues:

1\. Eyes, Arteries, Nervous System, and Kidneys: Affected by glycation, a process where sugar combines with proteins, leading to tissue dysfunction.

2\. A1C Score: Measures glycated hemoglobin, indicating diabetes severity.

3\. Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs): Result from glycation, causing free radical damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress.

Natural inhibitors of glycation include vitamins like benfotiamine, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, tocotrienols (without tocopherols), and Vitamin B6. Other effective inhibitors are alpha lipoic acid, green tea (EGCG), aged garlic, bitter melon, quercetin, curcumin, fasting, and exercise.

***

## What effective strategies and practices can I implement to enhance my stamina and endurance over time?

To improve your stamina, consider these key strategies:

1\. **Tocotrienols:** Enhance oxygen delivery to muscles, improving endurance and reducing fatigue.

2\. **Methylene Blue:** Temporarily boosts mitochondrial function, providing more oxygen for exercise, especially beneficial for smokers or those with mitochondrial damage.

Exercise is crucial for overall health, offsetting genetic weaknesses and improving cardiovascular health, even with poor sleep. Consistency in exercise is vital. Additionally, ensure your diet includes sufficient protein to support stamina and endurance.

## What effective strategies and remedies can be used to relieve discomfort in the sinuses?

There are certain acupressure points you can work on to help someone breathe through their sinuses better. To do this acupressure technique, we are going to use my Massage Tool.

This unique acupressure device is like a tri-pod with different sizes. I like to start with the widest part of the tool. Depending on the size of your body, you may need to use a more narrow part of the Massage Tool.

**How to do this acupressure technique for sinus discomfort:**

1\. Starting with the widest part of the Massage Tool, place the device on the back of the chair behind the neck.

2\. Sit back, resting your neck on the device. There are six vertebrae on your neck. The device should push against your second vertebra. The tool should not hit the point right under your skull, but about a 1/2 inch lower.

3\. Hold that pressure on the second vertebra for about 2 minutes.

## What effective strategies and treatments can be employed to alleviate neck stiffness and improve mobility?

Neck has a lot of muscles, bones and ligaments that are tightly connected. When you have stiffness in your neck, this can be caused by several reasons.

General relief remedies for stiff neck

Aside from the gallbladder issues, neck stiffness can be caused due to the pinched nerve, injuries, muscle tension or wrong bone position. Certain massage and acupressure techniques can help resolve this issue.

**Potential cause of digestive organs issues**

Our liver and pancreas are connected to the nerves that extend to the top of the body. If you have liver problems, gallbladder issues, blockage in the ducts or inflammation in that area this can definitely cause neck stiffness and different aches on the top side of the body. This is one of the reasons why massaging the neck doesn’t fully solve the neck pain and stiffness.

## What effective strategies can be employed to preserve muscle mass as one ages?

Around age 50, women experience menopause, leading to hormonal shifts, while men undergo similar changes around age 60. These changes can contribute to sarcopenia, or muscle loss, affecting metabolic health.

Estrogen and progesterone decline in women with age, impacting muscle health. Cholesterol, essential for steroid hormone production like testosterone and estrogen, plays a crucial role in muscle maintenance. Low-cholesterol diets and statin drugs can contribute to muscle issues.

To support hormone balance and muscle preservation:

1. Use infrared light, such as sunlight or fire, to boost melatonin production.
2. Regular resistance exercises are vital for muscle maintenance.
3. Ensure adequate intake of animal protein.
4. Include cholesterol-rich foods like meat and dairy in your diet.
5. Consider pregnenolone supplements (30 mg/day for women, 100 mg/day for men).
6. Supplement with DHEA (25 mg/day for women, 100 mg/day for men) to support muscle-building hormones.

***

## What effective strategies can I implement to alleviate restless leg syndrome and address the burning sensation in my feet?

That condition sounds to me like something like peripheral neuropathy. So hopefully you're taking Benfotiamine. That's for peripheral neuropathy.And it usually comes with alpha-lipoic acid together. Those are two wonderful things for the nerves. I don't know what your diet looks like, but I hope you get on keto and intermittent fasting because that would ultimately correct it.

This is really a problem with this issue with the depletion of vitamin B1 when you're taking so many carbs. On a rare occasion, it could be coming from an imbalance with magnesium and calcium.

***

## What else can decrease my calcium levels?

While we've covered the essentials of calcium and nutrition, there are other crucial aspects to consider for maintaining optimal bone health.

#### **1. The Importance of Weight-Bearing Exercise**

Just like muscles, bones become stronger with regular exercise. Weight-bearing exercises, in particular, are crucial for building and maintaining bone density. These exercises force your body to work against gravity, stimulating bone-building cells. Aim for at least 30 minutes of weight-bearing exercise most days of the week. Here are some examples:

* Walking: A simple yet effective way to improve bone density, especially for beginners. Brisk walking is ideal.
* Running/Jogging: Provides a higher impact than walking, leading to greater bone strengthening.
* Dancing: A fun and engaging way to incorporate weight-bearing movements.
* Stair Climbing: Excellent for building bone density in the legs and hips.
* Strength Training: Lifting weights or using resistance bands helps build muscle mass, which in turn, supports bone health.

#### **2. The Detrimental Effects of Smoking**

Smoking is harmful to nearly every organ in the body, including your bones. It interferes with calcium absorption and reduces bone density, making bones weaker and more prone to fractures.

If you smoke, quitting is one of the best things you can do for your bone health, as well as your overall well-being.

#### **3. Understanding the Role of Genetics**

While lifestyle choices play a significant role in bone health, genetics also factor in. A family history of osteoporosis or low bone density can increase your risk. If you have such a history, talk to your doctor.

They may recommend bone density screenings earlier than usual to monitor your bone health and discuss preventive measures.

***

## What essential steps should one take to prepare for a detox regimen?

**Proper detoxification is crucial. An unbalanced detox can lead to the release of endotoxins, triggering immune reactions and disrupting bile flow. This stagnation can harm the liver and cause toxin buildup in the blood, reducing glutathione levels and increasing oxidative stress.**

**Detoxification occurs in three phases: release, breakdown, and elimination. Endotoxins can impair bile flow, hindering phases two and three, resulting in detox reactions.**

**Detox Reactions:**

1\. Herxheimer reaction (flu-like symptoms)

2\. Right-quadrant pain

3\. Nausea

4\. Stool changes

5\. Itchiness

6\. Vision changes

7\. Dark urine

**Pre-detox Preparation:**

**- Take purified bile salts 30 minutes before starting detox. If reactions occur, additional bile salts may help.**

***

## What exactly constitutes subclinical hypothyroidism?

Subclinical hypothyroidism occurs when thyroid function is slow, but blood tests appear normal. Key trace minerals essential for thyroid function include iodine, selenium, copper, and zinc. Zinc is particularly crucial as it aids in the conversion and synthesis of thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) and the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

A hypothyroid condition can impede zinc absorption, potentially leading to a deficiency. If you have thyroid symptoms, consider increasing your zinc intake through shellfish, sea kelp, or supplements.

## What factors can disrupt a good night's sleep?

Sleep significantly impacts health, particularly heart function and longevity. Poor sleep correlates with disrupted blood sugar, increased cravings, higher cortisol levels, and mood disturbances.

Factors hindering good sleep include high cortisol, low levels of vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, potassium, B12, B1, and zinc. Additionally, poor sleep environments, melatonin supplementation, exposure to blue light and EMF, and stimulant consumption affect sleep quality.

Improving sleep involves cutting out sugar, adopting a low-carb diet, avoiding late or excessive eating, and focusing on relaxed breathing techniques to facilitate faster sleep onset.

***

## What factors can disrupt quality sleep and hinder the ability to achieve a restful night?

Sleep has a significant impact on your health. I want to cover the top things that can prevent you from getting a good night’s sleep. There’s a direct correlation between your sleep and overall heart function and longevity. A lack of sleep can affect your blood sugar levels and increase cravings and hunger. Poor sleep can also raise your cortisol and affect your mood.

**The top things that prevent you from sleeping:**

1\. High cortisol

2\. Low vitamin D

3\. Low calcium

4\. Low magnesium

5\. Low potassium

6\. A bad sleeping environment

7\. Taking melatonin

8\. Blue light and EMF

9\. Low vitamin B12

10\. Low vitamin B1

11\. Low zinc

12\. Stimulants

Cutting out sugar and going on a low-carb diet is crucial to help you start sleeping better. Also, avoid eating too late or overeating to help support better sleep. Another great tip is to focus on your breathing to help you fall asleep fast.

## What factors contribute to a child's ADHD diagnosis, and how do genetic, environmental, and neurological elements interact in this condition?

**ADHD is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.**

**First,** I want to start off by saying that ADHD is not genetic—there’s no evidence that says it is. In fact, it’s also not a Ritalin deficiency. From my viewpoint, it’s not even a mental disease—it’s purely a nutritional deficiency.

**Symptoms of ADHD include:**

• Inability to focus/pay attention

• Hyperactivity

• Restlessness

• Visual learning problems

• Difficulty reading

• Poor memory

A 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial showed significant improvements in the behavior of children with ADHD when given high doses of EPA and DHA (750mg) daily. If you have ADHD, (EPA and DHA) can help. You especially want to take EPA. EPA and DHA are omega-3 fatty acids. You have omega-3s, and you have omega-6s. Your body cannot make these—you have to get them from your diet.

The problem is, you need more omega-3s and less omega-6s. Omega-3s are far more important. However, the average person consumes 16x more omega-6s.

Omega-3s have antipsychotic properties, improve your cognition, and boost your IQ. They also help with brain development. Omega-3s can improve levels of dopamine and serotonin. They have neuron-protecting powers. Vitamin B1 can also help your child with restlessness and hyperactivity. Nutritional yeast is a great source of B vitamins.

## What factors contribute to bloating that tends to worsen as the day progresses?

There are 2 reasons, one being insulin resistance and the second, being low cortisol. Insulin resistance is a state whereby there are higher amounts of insulin in the body, which is highly inflammatory.

The second problem is low cortisol because cortisol created from the adrenal is anti-inflammatory and if you do not have this hormone in the correct quantity, then stress throughout the day will cause inflammation and swell the belly. If you wake up and your stomach is small and go to bed and your belly is big. So if your belly swells and gets bigger and bloated through the day, then fix insulin resistance and maybe even low cortisol.

## What factors contribute to elevated blood sugar levels in the morning?

This condition, known as the dawn phenomenon, can affect those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or severe insulin resistance. Elevated morning blood sugar can be caused by:

1\. Cortisol spike: Peaks between 6 and 9 am, increasing glucose production.

2\. Type 1 diabetes: Growth hormone spikes can raise blood sugar.

3\. Type 2 diabetes: The liver produces glucose, and hormones like glucagon and epinephrine may elevate blood sugar.

4\. Evening carbs: Consuming high-carb meals the night before.

To manage high morning blood sugar, try adhering to a healthy ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. Exercising, avoiding carbs at night, and drinking diluted apple cider vinegar before bed can all help as well.

## 7 Early Signs of Liver Damage

**7 Surprising Signs of Liver Damage**

While alcoholic fatty liver disease is a concern, most liver issues stem from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Here are some unexpected signs to watch for:

1. **Bulging or Tightness Under the Right Rib Cage:** This can sometimes lead to right shoulder pain due to pressure on the phrenic nerve.
2. **Loss of Energy:** This differs from typical fatigue. You might experience decreased endurance, especially during exercise, tiredness after eating, or a need for early bedtimes.
3. **Itchiness:** Often worse at night, this itchiness, especially on the feet, is caused by bile salts building up in tissues due to liver problems.
4. **Red Dots or Spider Veins:** High estrogen levels due to liver damage can cause these skin changes. Men might also develop breast tissue, while women might experience symptoms of estrogen dominance.
5. **Thyroid Problems:** Liver issues can impact thyroid function, leading to symptoms like fatigue, hair loss, high cholesterol, and dry skin.
6. **Low Vitamin D:** Liver damage can exacerbate existing vitamin D deficiency. Look out for inflammation, weakened immunity, and muscle problems.
7. **Dark Urine:** Dark, strong-smelling urine can be a sign of liver problems.

**The Root Cause**

Whether it's a fatty liver, inflammation, or cirrhosis, the root cause of many liver problems is often the consumption of sugar, starches, and seed oils.

**The Solution**

Eliminating these culprits from your diet can potentially reverse fatty liver and improve other chronic health issues.

## 8 Ways Your Body Tells You - You Have a Disease

1\. Heart attack/cardiovascular disease Symptoms of heart disease include chest pain, left jaw pain, left shoulder pain, and pain that goes down your left arm. You might also feel dizzy or out of breath when walking upstairs.

Vitamin E in the form of tocotrienols and vitamin K2 can help support the health of your heart and arteries.

2\. Stroke Early warning signs of a stroke involve issues on one side of the body. You might also experience slurred speech. If you think you’re having a stroke, get to the emergency room quickly!

3\. Infections If you have an infection, you may experience a tickle in your throat, a cough that won’t go away, sneezing, or a runny nose.

Take 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 and consume zinc, vitamin C, and echinacea. Don’t suppress your fever!

4\. Fatty liver disease If you have a fatty liver, you’ll have feelings of fullness, tightness, or tenderness under the right rib cage. You might experience referred pain in the right shoulder or right rhomboid.

Intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet may help reverse a fatty liver. It’s also important to avoid alcohol.

5\. Gallstones Warning signs of gallstones include dark urine, stool that floats, light-colored stool, and constipation.

Gallstones are the result of low bile salts, so increasing bile salts may help.

6\. Kidney stones Pain in the abdomen on one side or flank pain can signify kidney stones.

Try drinking 2 ounces of lemon juice with water. Take magnesium glycinate and avoid foods high in oxalates.

7\. Ulcers If you have an ulcer, you might feel burning stomach pain that typically feels better after eating.

Wheatgrass juice powder with water and zinc carnosine may help improve your condition.

8\. Diabetes If you have diabetes, you’ll find it very difficult to skip a meal.

You’ll likely experience carb cravings and need a nap after eating. Keto and intermittent fasting may greatly help improve your symptoms.

## Acetylcholine's Role in Mental Health

### **Acetylcholine's Role in Mental Health**

The brain is like a complex highway, with neurotransmitters acting as traffic signals. Acetylcholine is one such signal, vital for rest and digestion.

#### **Acetylcholine Deficiency and Its Effects**

An acetylcholine deficiency can be likened to faulty traffic lights—things go haywire. It can lead to memory loss, difficulty concentrating, or even depression.

Vitamins B1 and C are essential for keeping acetylcholine levels balanced. A lack of these vitamins could put your mental health at risk.

#### **Diet's Influence on Acetylcholine Levels**

Eating habits play a significant role, too. Picture high-carb diets and sugar as roadblocks that lower the production of this critical neurotransmitter.

Opting for more greens may help boost your body’s ability to produce acetylcholinic acid, clearing the path.

A persistent exhaustion syndrome, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), correlates to depression. The CDC reports that individuals with CFS are four times more likely to experience major depressive disorder than those without the syndrome.

Dysfunctional mitochondria could be at play here. As powerhouses of our cells, when they fail to produce enough energy, it can result in physical exhaustion and potentially trigger depressive symptoms.

Similarly, viral infections might have a role too. Research suggests that certain viruses, such as [Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/epstein-barr-virus-and-its-main-trigger-stress), often seen in CFS patients, may lead to changes in brain function, contributing to depression.

This complex relationship between chronic fatigue and depression calls for an integrated treatment approach that addresses this challenging condition's mental and physical causes.

## Am I potentially consuming an excessive amount of dietary fat?

Let's just talk about dietary fat. If you were to eat fat, let's say you ate so much fat per day, and with that fat you had some carbohydrates, now we're going to just go storage, storage, storage. Because your body's only running on glucose, and you can't tap into that reserve. When you're in keto, now you can actually burn the fat. Now does that mean you can just eat unlimited fat and it's all going to get burned? No.

Here's various factors. Number one, your age, your metabolism, how much insulin resistance you have, which will determine how much fat you'll have actually being burned. So it's kind of, there's just, it's hard to give you more of an answer than that.

That's just the general concept. But if you do this and you notice, wow, not losing weight, even though you're in ketosis, because those ketones could be coming from dietary fat, it really, probably the best way to determine if it's being stored is if you're gaining weight, which is going to be very unlikely. You just might not be losing as much weight.

So there is a point of like too much fat. So does fat get stored like a carbohydrate would get stored because of a carbohydrate? No. What determines whether it gets stored is two things. One is how much of that fat you're using as energy or not, and then also what's going on with your insulin levels. It really depends on if you're doing carbs with that fat, right? That's really the key. If you keep your carbs really, really low, I mean like if you like, if it's zero and you're doing fat, it's very unlikely you're going to be burning that fats.

A good amount of it will be eliminated through the digestive system as well, but it's not(4:51) just going to be converted over there because the pathway of the metabolism of fat is actually (4:59) very different than glucose.

## Are eye exams important?

Prevention is critical when it comes to health, and eye health is no exception. Regular eye exams are crucial for the early detection and management of eye conditions, even if you haven’t noticed any changes in your vision.

Think of these appointments as essential maintenance for your eyes. During an eye exam, an eye care professional can detect early signs of eye diseases that you might not be aware of, allowing for timely intervention and treatment.

Early detection is essential in preventing visual acuity loss and maintaining good eye health.

***

## Are ice baths beneficial for your health?

Ice baths can be highly therapeutic, although they can feel quite uncomfortable, especially during the winter months. If you're able to endure the cold, consider supplementing with vitamin B1 (thiamine) to enhance your tolerance to temperature extremes, as a deficiency in B1 can diminish your overall stress resilience.

Engaging in ice baths may significantly reduce inflammation and improve cognitive function. Whether you choose to immerse yourself in a cold pond during winter, take a cold bath, or opt for a cold shower, you can experience the therapeutic benefits of cold exposure.

## Are insects a viable source of protein?

The idea of eating insects by 2050 due to population growth and sustainability concerns is debated. While insects are rich in protein, fat, and carbs, the quantity needed to meet dietary needs could be costly and less nutritious if feeding practices are compromised.

Comparatively, insects fall short of beef in protein and nutritional value. They also carry potential pathogens; studies show high rates of parasites and pathogenic bacteria among edible cricket farms. Additionally, those allergic to shellfish may react to insects due to similar proteins. Chitin in insect exoskeletons acts as an antinutrient, blocking absorption of vitamins A and E.

***

## Are there any diagnostic tests for adrenal fatigue?

### **Diagnostic Tests for Adrenal Dysfunction**

When it comes to adrenal dysfunction, early detection is crucial. Let's explore a few ways to identify this disorder.

#### **Raglan's Test**

The Raglan's test gauges blood pressure variations when transitioning from lying down to standing up. In healthy individuals, the systolic (upper) number usually rises slightly.

If your [systolic pressure](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-is-my-systolic-blood-pressure-high) does not increase or decrease, it could indicate adrenal fatigue. This quick and easy home test provides valuable insights, but remember - it shouldn’t replace professional medical advice.

#### **CO2 Tolerance Test**

This one measures how long you can exhale after a deep breath – like blowing out birthday candles, except these won't get you any gifts. Check out more on CO2 tolerance testing here.

A shorter exhalation time could indicate low carbon dioxide levels in your body - another possible sign of adrenal dysfunction. But don't worry. If the results seem off, there are ways to fix this.

## Are there specific beverages known to alleviate symptoms of depression?

Green tea, known for its unfermented leaves, contains active compounds beneficial for health, including reducing depression. Studies show drinking green tea can lower depression rates significantly, with L-theanine contributing to mood stabilization. Green tea affects brain regions like the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus, improving cognitive function and memory. It also offers anti-carcinogenic, antimicrobial, and neuroprotective properties.

Other natural methods to combat depression include:

* **Exercise:** Similar to Zoloft, exercise reduces depression symptoms. High-intensity interval training is particularly effective.
* **Vitamin D:** Deficiency increases depression risk; sunlight exposure and supplements are crucial.
* **Fasting:** Can enhance bodily functions and reduce depression symptoms due to its survival properties.

These approaches can complement each other in managing and alleviating symptoms of depression naturally.

***

## Are you a liver type if you’ve had your gallbladder removed?

Having your gallbladder removed doesn't categorically label you as a "liver type," but it does indicate potential issues related to bile production and management. Gallbladder removal often occurs due to conditions like gallstones or infections, which can also reflect underlying liver health concerns, as the liver produces bile salts. While it doesn't definitively mean you are a "liver type," it suggests a need to monitor liver health and bile production, as both are interconnected in the digestive process.

***

## Are you experiencing symptoms of copper deficiency?

Zinc can be beneficial for many different health problems. But, if you take too much zinc (over 40mg) over a period of weeks, this could create a copper deficiency.

Zinc and copper work together. So, it’s always good to take copper when you’re taking zinc to avoid a copper deficiency. You could also take all of the trace minerals together with zinc.

Symptoms of a copper deficiency:

1\. Nausea

2\. Flu-like symptoms (this is due to neutropenia, which is lowered white blood cells)

3\. Anemia (fatigue and weakness)

4\. Stomach pain

5\. Tingling and numbness in the hands or feet

6\. Diarrhea

7\. Loss of skin tone

8\. Vomiting

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/too-much-zinc-causes-a-copper-deficiency)

***

## Are you taking too much zinc?

The recommended daily zinc intake is 11 mg for adult males and 9 mg for adult females. While individuals with deficiencies or infections may benefit from higher doses, adults should not exceed 40 mg daily to avoid toxicity. Factors like low stomach acid, stress, and high sugar intake can contribute to zinc deficiency. Dr. Berg suggests that doses above 40 mg may be beneficial in certain cases. If taking high doses of zinc, it's crucial to supplement with copper at a 10:1 zinc-to-copper ratio. Always consult with a healthcare professional before taking zinc supplements, especially if you have existing health conditions or are on medication.

Zinc Toxicity: Are You Taking Too Much?

[https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-much-zinc-is-too-toxic](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-much-zinc-is-too-toxic)

***

## Are zinc poisoning and zinc toxicity the same thing?

Zinc poisoning typically results from a single large dose of zinc, leading to acute symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps.

Zinc toxicity is characterized by the development of health issues caused by chronic zinc exposure linked to symptoms such as anemia, copper deficiency, and neurological problems.

***

## At what blood sugar levels does the risk of damage to bodily systems increase?

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends an A1C below 7.4, equivalent to a blood sugar level of 166, which is too high. Damage from high blood sugar begins above 100. A study shows that fasting blood glucose between 110 and 125 can destroy 40% of pancreatic beta cells, leading to less insulin and more damage. The ideal A1C is under 5%. To improve your levels, consider reducing refined carbs and sugar, and try intermittent fasting, which may help reverse damage if addressed early.

## B12 Deficiency Symptoms That You Should NEVER Ignore

While it's true that vegans and vegetarians are at a higher risk, vitamin B12 deficiency can affect anyone. This crucial nutrient plays a role in DNA production and repair, and a deficiency can elevate your cancer risk. It also supports nerve health, and a shortage can lead to anemia.

Early signs of deficiency include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, and tingling in the extremities.

As the deficiency progresses, you might experience:

• Tongue changes (red, swollen, shiny)

• Mouth ulcers

• Shortness of breath

• Dizziness upon standing

• Cognitive issues

• Anxiety and depression

• Sleep disruptions

• Vitiligo (skin patches)

Severe deficiency can result in walking difficulties, muscle weakness, and serious psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations. It can even lead to permanent nerve damage.

If you don't eat animal products regularly, you're at risk. Incorporate foods like clams, liver, sardines, red meat, tuna, salmon, grass-fed dairy, and eggs into your diet.

Low stomach acid or a genetic issue called polymorphism can also hinder B12 absorption.

If you supplement, choose methylcobalamin, the natural form. Remember, a healthy liver, small intestine, and acidic stomach are essential for proper B12 absorption and function.

## Bloating - The Ultimate Indicator of the Right Diet

Have you ever felt like a balloon ready to pop after a big meal or constantly battling the urge to unbutton your jeans? You're not alone. Digestive woes affect a whopping 70% of us, but the good news is that gut health is the key to easing much of this discomfort.

Think of your gut health journey as a puzzle where everything from diet to exercise plays a role. Even seemingly innocent habits like drinking through a straw or consuming dairy can trigger bloating.

Let's explore why certain foods make us feel like we've swallowed a balloon and uncover dietary changes that offer relief. Say goodbye to nights spent on the couch fighting discomfort and hello to a more comfortable you.

The small intestine is your body's unsung hero, breaking down food and absorbing nutrients. Its vast surface area, covered in villi and microvilli, ensures you get the most out of every bite. This intricate design is essential for transforming proteins, fats, and carbs into usable energy.

Your gut bacteria are also crucial players, assisting in breaking down food that your enzymes alone can't handle. A healthy gut microbiome, fueled by fiber-rich foods, is a powerhouse for overall well-being.

But what affects your small intestine's health? Processed foods, seed oils, synthetic starches, and sugars are like unwanted guests, causing inflammation and damage. These troublemakers can disrupt your gut's delicate balance.

Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) is another culprit. It's like an overcrowded party where microbes end up in places they shouldn't be, leading to excessive bloating and fermentation. If you're constantly battling bloat, SIBO might be to blame.

Your diet is your gut's best friend. Fiber, found in abundance in salads, is essential for healthy digestion and stool quality. Gradually increasing fiber intake can transform sluggishness into lightness and energy.

Variety is also key to gut health. By diversifying your plant intake, you introduce new microbes that enrich your gut's ecosystem. Even occasional fasting can give your digestive system a break, promoting microbial diversity and reducing inflammation.

Digestive health isn't just about avoiding discomfort; it's about overall well-being. Your nervous system and colon are interconnected, so nourishing meals are essential for maintaining balance. Magnesium-rich leafy greens are natural peacekeepers, preventing colon spasms.

Nutrients like magnesium, B vitamins, and zinc are vital for nerve function and repair, supporting a happy gut and a happier you. Simple dietary tweaks, like adding spinach to your smoothie or choosing whole grains, can significantly impact your digestive health.

Your body often sends signals about its needs through bloating, constipation, or floating stool. These signs can indicate potential issues with your gallbladder, pancreas, or overall digestion. Bloating might be a whisper from dairy products or a shout from carbonated drinks. Stool quality, whether floating or hard, hints at possible malabsorption or fiber deficiency.

These signs are your body's way of communicating. Listen to them and adjust your diet accordingly. By avoiding trigger foods and making necessary changes, you can say goodbye to stomach pain and hello to improved gut health.

Boosting stomach acid is another key to better digestion. Betaine hyaluronic chloride can help increase stomach acid levels, leading to easier digestion, better nutrient absorption, and a stronger defense against harmful bacteria. However, consult a healthcare professional before making significant changes.

Remember, gut health is a journey, not a destination. It's about finding balance and listening to your body. By making informed choices, incorporating fiber-rich foods, embracing variety, and supporting your stomach acid, you can pave the way to a happier, healthier gut and a more vibrant you.

## Boosting Your Immune System Naturally: Vitamin D vs. Prednisone

**Boosting Your Immune System Naturally: Vitamin D vs. Prednisone**

Your immune system is a complex network with two main components:

* **Innate Immunity:** Your body's first line of defense, present from birth.
* **Acquired Immunity:** Develops over time as you encounter various infections.

Autoimmune diseases arise from problems with the "peacekeepers" of your immune system, called T-regulatory cells or T-cells. These cells are crucial for turning off the immune response once a threat is neutralized.

While prednisone, a synthetic cortisol, is often used to treat autoimmune diseases, it suppresses both parts of your immune system. **Vitamin D offers a different approach:**

* **Empowers Immunity:** Unlike prednisone, vitamin D enhances your immune system, particularly increasing T-cell production.
* **Reduces Inflammation:** Vitamin D suppresses inflammatory cells (TH1 and TH17), which are often overactive in autoimmune conditions.
* **Blood Sugar Control:** Prednisone can raise blood sugar levels, while vitamin D actually helps regulate them and supports insulin production.
* **Bone Health:** Prednisone can weaken bones, but vitamin D promotes calcium absorption and bone health.
* **Thymus Support:** The thymus gland, responsible for T-cell production, declines with age. Vitamin D helps slow this decline, but requires therapeutic doses and essential cofactors like magnesium, vitamin K2, and zinc.

**The Coimbra Protocol:**

Dr. Coimbra in Brazil developed a protocol using high doses of vitamin D to overcome resistance and significantly increase its levels in the body. This, in turn, lowers parathyroid hormone and helps manage autoimmune conditions.

**Key Takeaway:**

Vitamin D offers a natural way to support and modulate your immune system, unlike prednisone which suppresses it. Consult with a healthcare professional to determine if vitamin D therapy is right for you.

## Can a deficiency in potassium contribute to the development of heart failure?

**A potassium deficiency is also known as hypokalemia. Potassium is involved in muscle physiology, nerve physiology, and cardiovascular physiology. You can develop atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure, or a high pulse rate with low potassium levels. Low potassium can also lead to insulin resistance and cravings for carbs.**

The symptoms of potassium deficiency include:

• Tiredness

• Leg cramps

• Weakness

• Constipation

• Tremors

A recent article highlights the fact that maintaining normal potassium levels is vital to supporting a healthy heart. Potassium can help reduce your risk of artery disease, stroke, and heart attack. It can also help support your artery elasticity.

**The best sources of potassium are:**

• Beet tops

• Vegetables

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/the-root-cause-of-cardiac-arrhythmias-ismust-watch)

• Figs

***

## Can a deficiency in potassium influence blood sugar levels, and what mechanisms might explain the relationship between these two factors?

Yes, having a potassium deficiency can cause blood sugar issues. When you consume more carbohydrates, you become insulin resistant, which leads to higher blood sugar levels. Potassium is involved in storing glucose as glycogen. Increasing potassium intake can aid with proper glucose storage. This is why potassium is a key ingredient of Blood Sugar Support Advanced Formula.

***

## Can a deficiency in vitamin B contribute to the development or exacerbation of anxiety, and what specific B vitamins are most closely linked to mental health?

**Low B vitamins**

B vitamins are crucial for calmness, relaxation, and healthy sleep. Low B vitamins can reduce your ability to handle physical and mental stress, which can result in anxiety symptoms. B vitamin deficiency mainly stems from not consuming them in your diet or consuming things that deplete you of them.

## Can a ketogenic diet provide benefits for individuals with Alzheimer's disease?

**Alzheimer’s and ketosis:**

As well as the rest of the human body, our brain runs on fuel. Alzheimer’s disease (whether caused by genetics or brain damage) makes the brain unable to efficiently utilize sugar/carb fuel (glucose), resulting in brain starvation. However, our brains love ketones (fat-burning fuel) more than sugar/carb fuel anyway. Although the damaged brain parts of Alzheimer’s disease patients can’t utilize glucose efficiently, they can successfully utilize ketones.

***

## Can adopting a plant-based diet contribute to the reduction of fibroids?

Following a keto diet can be more challenging on a plant-based regimen due to the need for adequate protein and essential nutrients like B12, bioavailable forms of zinc and iron, and retinol (the active form of vitamin A). While it is possible to achieve a vegan keto diet, careful planning is essential to ensure you're obtaining these vital nutrients. I recommend watching my videos on how to effectively implement a vegan-style keto approach, as you may need to incorporate additional nutritional sources to meet your dietary needs.

***

## Can adrenal fatigue lead to weight gain?

Adrenal fatigue, particularly chronic stress, can lead to weight gain, exacerbated by poor dietary habits. Cortisol, released during stress, increases energy (sugar) storage as fat when unused, and can degrade muscle mass by converting it into sugar. Additionally, cortisol inhibits fat burning, making ketosis difficult.

Addressing stress sources is crucial. Implementing Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting can help, along with ensuring adequate intake of vitamin D, vitamin C, and potassium.

## Can blood-thinning medications lead to an increased tendency to bruise, and what mechanisms underlie this effect?

Blood-thinning medications can cause excessive bruising because they prevent clots from stopping blood loss. If you are on blood thinners or calcium channel blockers (for example, in some blood pressure medications) they can cause easy bruising. If you suspect this is the reason, consult with your doctor.

***

## Can carbohydrate consumption contribute to the experience of brain fog?

Brain Fog Overview

**Symptoms**:

\- Lapse of awareness

\- Forgetfulness

\- Inability to focus

\- Easily distracted

**Causes**:

\- **Excess Refined Carbs and Sugar**: Leads to brain fuel deprivation.

## Can castor oil worsen hot flashes?

Castor oil is renowned for its multifaceted benefits such as skincare and anti-inflammatory properties; however, it is not typically recommended for alleviating hot flashes. While it serves as a laxative and antioxidant, alternative approaches such as iodine or DIM (diindolylmethane) could be explored for managing hot flashes more effectively. For personalized guidance on suitable alternatives or supplements, consulting with a healthcare provider is advisable, as individual responses to treatments can vary significantly.

***

## Can chronic stress contribute to the development of clogged arteries?

As you know already, high amounts of inflammation can damage your arterial tissue and your body will try to heal the damage with plaques. Chronic stress can eventually lead to inflammation because one of the stress-regulating hormones is cortisol, which has anti-inflammatory properties. If your stress-regulating glands (adrenals) are worn out, producing too much cortisol over time, this can eventually result in inflammation, damage and arterial clogging.

## Can coffee consumption lead to inflammation in the body?

Coffee can have both benefits and potential drawbacks regarding inflammation. While some individuals may experience worsened inflammation, especially those with gut sensitivities or intolerances to herbs and plants, coffee is generally known to have anti-inflammatory properties for many people. It's essential to observe personal tolerance and consider reducing or avoiding coffee if it exacerbates inflammation or digestive issues. Consulting a healthcare provider can offer tailored advice based on individual health concerns.

***

## Can crossing your legs contribute to low back pain?

Crossing legs excessively can contribute to low back pain due to the imbalance it creates in the muscles supporting the pelvis. When one side's hip-raising muscles shorten from prolonged crossing, it can misalign the vertebrae and compress nerves, leading to discomfort.

To assess and alleviate this issue:

\- Alternate crossing legs to avoid overuse on one side.

\- Check for tightness in the crossed leg's hip-raising muscle.

\- Stretch the tight side gently to restore balance.

\- Use a self-test involving standing with one leg on a book to gauge discomfort and flexibility differences between sides.

\- Perform exercises to strengthen and stretch the affected muscles, such as lifting and lowering the opposite leg while keeping the knee locked.

Consistent practice of these exercises can relieve existing pain and prevent future issues by promoting muscle balance and pelvic alignment.

## Can damage to brain cells lead to the phenomenon of brain fog, and what specific mechanisms or conditions might facilitate this cognitive impairment?

Bruises—also known as contusions—happen when the capillaries under your skin have bled internally due to their weakness or due to impact. Bruising is very common, and not typically something to worry about. However, if you bruise very easily, this can be a sign of an underlying issue.

**Cause #1: Nutrient deficiencies**

Vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients are important for the healthy structure of blood vessels and the thickness of your blood. If you have a nutrient deficiency, this can weaken your capillaries or thin your blood, leading to excessive bleeding.

* **Calcium is vital for the healthy structure of your veins and capillaries. If you lack calcium, this can result in bruising easily.**
* **Vitamin D deficiency can cause an inability to absorb calcium, resulting in the above condition.**
* **Lack of vitamin K1. This vitamin helps your blood clot. If you have malabsorption or lack of bile (gallbladder not functioning properly or removed) this will create inability to absorb vitamins K1 and D).**
* **Lack of vitamin C. This has everything to do with keeping your capillaries strong. Without it, you lose collagen that surrounds your capillaries.**
* **Low vitamin B12 and low folate can cause insufficient amounts of thrombocytes (cells that help you with blood clotting.)**

## Can damage to brain cells lead to the phenomenon of brain fog?

**Damage of brain cells**

Another cause of brain fog is damage of the brain cells, for example due to aging or injury. Additionally, lack of sleep can cause hormonal imbalance and this can result in a bad effect on your brain. Prolonged fasting will help not only with providing ketones to feed your brain, but also by activating autophagy (healing/detoxifying process in the body).

## Can eating salad contribute to weight gain?

Hidden carbs from croutons, dried fruit, or salad dressings can cause weight gain, but if you're following keto and intermittent fasting, they are likely not the issue.

Increased salad intake may lead to digestive issues if your body lacks the necessary microbes and enzymes. Vegetables contain two types of fiber: soluble (retains water) and insoluble (does not). Inadequate fiber breakdown can slow digestion and cause water retention, leading to weight gain.

To prevent this, try:

1\. Steaming vegetables to break down fiber.

2\. Choosing easier-to-digest vegetables like squash, cauliflower, broccoli, and asparagus.

3\. Gradually increasing vegetable intake to build up gut microflora.

This approach helps reduce bloating and water retention while your body adjusts to digesting fiber efficiently.

***

## Can eczema be linked to salicylate sensitivity?

One common cause of eczema: Salicylate sensitivity. This is a natural acid present in plants, spices, and nuts. It's a protective mechanism for plants. I would recommend just avoiding all these triggers for 1 week and see if your skin improves to know for sure if you have this problem.

## Can elevated insulin levels contribute to the development of clogged arteries?

Clogged arteries are created due to certain plaques in the blood routes. This can create a lot of difficulty and stress on your body because it lowers the ability of blood to freely move through its channels.

**Myth about cholesterol**

When it comes to clogged arteries, most people focus on cholesterol. They want to lower their cholesterol by eliminating things like fat, butter, eggs and animal meat. I want to go over some additional data that has to do with the chain reaction that occurs before cholesterol enters your arteries.

Not all cholesterol is bad. In fact, your body makes a ton of it--more than 3,000 mg a day. Keep in mind that an egg only contains 300 mg of cholesterol. If your body makes so much, why is it considered bad? It’s not. Every cell wall is made from cholesterol. Hormones, specifically sex hormones, are made from cholesterol.

When your artery gets damaged, cholesterol comes as a band-aid for the damage, creating a plaque along with calcium and fibrin (connective tissue). However, we need to fix the underlying issue, which is this: what is creating the damage to your arteries in the first place? Knowing the cause of the damage, you can resolve the plaques and avoid the clogged-artery condition.

**Cause #1: High amounts of insulin**

Frequent eating and a high-carb diet will cause your insulin to be very high. Insulin is a hormone that has the capacity to cause clogged arteries. This is because insulin creates inflammation in the body, which eventually will result in damaged tissue. If this damage occurs in the arteries, your body will try to heal it using a combination of cholesterol, calcium and fibrin (connective tissue) that creates a plaque.

## Can excessive calcium intake lead to kidney stones?

Studies show that taking around 500mg of calcium carbonate will increase your risk of developing kidney stones. Massive doses of vitamin D over many months can also cause hypercalcemia, which can contribute to kidney stones. However, neither of these are the primary causes of kidney stones.

**The most common reasons for kidney stones are:**

1\. Kidney damage - years of bad dieting can cause poor kidney function. Try a healthy keto diet.

2\. Excess oxalates - avoid oxalate-rich foods, including almonds, spinach, swiss chard, and chocolate.

3\. Low citrates - take citrates or lemon juice.

4\. Low fluid - stay hydrated! At least 2.5 liters each day.

5\. Poor microbiome - improve your microbiome with probiotics and prebiotics (fiber).

6\. Low bile - take purified bile salts if you have low bile or a missing gallbladder.

## Can fenugreek help with hair loss when taking creatine?

Fenugreek may help mitigate hair loss associated with creatine use due to its potential to influence DHT levels, a potent form of testosterone linked to hair follicle health. Essential co-factors like zinc, copper, and selenium are crucial for activating proteins necessary for hair growth. Additionally, ensuring adequate intake of trace minerals and B vitamins is essential for supporting overall hair health.

***

## Can fluctuations in blood sugar levels contribute to the occurrence of headaches and migraines?

Low blood sugar can trigger headaches and migraines. When you eat carbs, your blood sugar goes up, and your ache may disappear. However this will not resolve the issue because shortly after, your blood sugar will go low again, causing a new headache.

I recommend getting on the Healthy Keto® diet, which will give your body a better type of fuel for your brain: ketones (a byproduct of fat-burning). Ketones will not cause your blood sugar to go up and down. Stable blood sugar may resolve the headache issue.

(Note: If you have just started a keto diet, headaches could be a symptom of adapting to the diet.)

***

## Can fruit extracts raise blood sugar levels?

Impact of Fruit Extracts on Blood Sugar [https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-only-sugar-that-wont-raise-your-blood-sugar](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-only-sugar-that-wont-raise-your-blood-sugar)

**Fructose Content**

Many fruit extracts contain fructose, a natural sugar. While fructose does not directly spike blood sugar levels like glucose, it is processed by the liver. Over time, excessive fructose consumption can lead to insulin resistance, which indirectly raises blood sugar levels.

**Glucose Content**

Some fruit extracts may also contain glucose, which directly increases blood sugar levels and triggers insulin release.

**Concentrated Sugars**

Fruit extracts are often concentrated, meaning they may contain higher levels of natural sugars compared to whole fruits. This concentration can lead to a more significant impact on blood sugar levels.

**Considerations for Managing Blood Sugar**

If you have conditions like Type 2 Diabetes or are managing blood sugar levels, it's essential to monitor the type and amount of fruit extracts consumed.

Opt for extracts with low or no added sugars and minimal fructose content.

Always check the nutritional label for sugar content and consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice.

***

## Can gallbladder problems cause fat malabsorption?

Yes, gallbladder problems can lead to fat malabsorption. Issues such as gallstones or gallbladder inflammation can hinder bile release, resulting in poor digestion of fats and inadequate absorption of fat-soluble nutrients, leading to digestive issues such as diarrhea, pale stools, and bloating.

***

## Can gut microbial imbalances lead to a reduced tolerance to allergens?

A microbial imbalance can cause decreased tolerance to allergens. This imbalance occurs when you have an overgrowth of bad bacteria and not enough good bacteria. You can help restore your microbial balance by supporting the good bacteria in your gut and by acidifying the stomach to reduce the overgrowth of bad bacteria.

## Can hypothyroidism develop into Hashimoto's thyroiditis?

While hypothyroidism doesn't always lead to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, it's important to note that in about 90% of cases, hypothyroidism is indeed linked to this autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid. Therefore, addressing the underlying autoimmune issue is essential.

In this context, I recommend focusing on selenium intake, as it is generally more beneficial than iodine, although a moderate amount of iodine can still be helpful. I've created a detailed video on this topic for further guidance.

Additionally, many cases of thyroid dysfunction can originate in the gut, highlighting the significant connection between gluten, grains, and autoimmune responses. It is crucial to avoid these foods to help manage symptoms effectively.

***

## Can I consume fats even if my gallbladder is removed?

The liver continues producing bile even without a gallbladder. Although there's no longer concentrated storage of bile, it flows directly from the liver into the small intestine at a steady rate allowing for ongoing digestion of dietary fats.

***

## Can I diagnose magnesium deficiency with a blood test?

Magnesium deficiency is notoriously difficult to diagnose accurately. Only about 1% of the body's magnesium is present in the blood, while the majority is stored within cells, bones, and muscles.

Therefore, standard blood tests, which measure serum magnesium levels, often fail to reflect an individual's true magnesium status. Even if blood levels appear normal, a person may still be deficient at the cellular level.

This difficulty in assessment leads to a significant underdiagnosis of magnesium deficiency, even though it is believed to be quite prevalent.

***

## Can I have apple cider vinegar if I have an ulcer?

If you have an ulcer, you’ll find that apple cider vinegar exacerbates your ulcer symptoms. It’s best to wait until your ulcer heals to consume apple cider vinegar.

***

## Can I take magnesium and berberine if I’m on a statin?

Yes, you can take magnesium and berberine while on a statin. However, it's crucial to supplement with Coenzyme Q10 in its reduced form, known as ubiquinol. Ubiquinol supports mitochondrial function and helps mitigate potential muscle issues associated with statin use, as it follows similar biochemical pathways affected by statins' inhibition of cholesterol production.

***

## Can I take testosterone?

Your body has a complex hormone feedback system that the brain uses to communicate to turn on or off testosterone production. When you change your natural hormone levels with external sources, there can be many side effects that may reduce your quality of life.

The effects of taking testosterone may include:

•Worsening sleep apnea

•Moodiness

•Acne

•Dizziness

•Higher risk of heart disease

•Decreased fertility

•Thickening of blood

•Testicular atrophy

•Erectile dysfunction

***

## Can insufficient nutrition cause hunger levels increasing?

### **Nutrient Intake and Hunger Signals**

Explains how insufficient nutrient intake, particularly from vegetables, can lead to feelings of hunger even on a low-carb diet.

![vinaigrette dressing](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/woman-adding-tasty-apple-vinegar-to-salad-with-vegetables-on-table.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **The Crucial Role of Vegetables**

Shedding light on how veggies, crucial for their nutrient-rich profiles and ability to fill you up, play an indispensable role in a low-carb diet.

Vegetables aren't just the colorful side characters on your plate; they're nutrient-dense superheroes fighting off hunger. When you skimp on these, especially in a low-carb diet, you might find yourself constantly raiding the fridge.

Veggies are packed with fiber and essential nutrients that help keep us whole.

This isn't just about filling up your stomach; it's about giving your body what it needs to function optimally. A lack of sufficient nutrient intake can leave you hungry no matter how much you eat. So next time, maybe let kale join the party, too.

#### **Addressing Nutrient Absorption Issues**

How insulin resistance and gallbladder or liver issues can affect nutrient absorption and satisfaction.

If eating more vegetables still leaves you wanting snacks, consider this: Maybe it's not what you eat but how your body handles it. Insulin resistance and gallbladder or liver issues can throw a wrench into nutrient absorption processes.

Facing such challenges doesn’t mean defeat; understanding them is step one toward adjusting your approach for better health outcomes.

Chatting with a health expert about these hurdles might be the secret sauce to mastering your appetite and maintaining a low-carb way of life.

## Can liver dysfunction be linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease?

There is some interesting data that suggest that Alzheimer’s may originate in the liver. The liver helps clear out certain plaques so they don’t spread to other parts of the body. But when the liver is compromised, it can have a hard time getting rid of the plaquing, which can then develop in the brain. Additionally, some of the symptoms of fatty liver disease and cirrhosis are similar to Alzheimer’s disease.

## Can magnesium deficiency cause acid reflux?

Magnesium plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, even extending to the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach and the proper functioning of the valves that prevent acid reflux.

Here are the key takeaways:

* **Magnesium's Widespread Impact:** Magnesium isn't just about energy production; it's essential for countless "mechanical gears and pumps" within our cells.
* **Stomach Acid Production:** Magnesium is necessary for producing hydrochloric acid, which is critical for digestion.
* **Valve Control:** Magnesium also helps control the valves at the top and bottom of the stomach, preventing acid reflux (GERD).
* **Magnesium Deficiency Consequences:** Without enough magnesium, individuals might experience low stomach acid.

Magnesium deficiency can lead to a cascade of problems and impact digestion. This further underlines the importance of maintaining adequate magnesium levels for overall health. If you are experiencing acid reflux or GERD, it is important to consult your healthcare professional for guidance.

***

## Can maltodextrin in deodorants be absorbed into the body?

Maltodextrin in deodorants is unlikely to absorb into your body and affect blood sugar levels directly. However, maltodextrin can significantly impact blood sugar responses and is commonly found in many daily products, including supplements and flavorings. It's advisable to be mindful of its presence in your diet and products you use.

***

## Can stress cause a stomach ulcer?

Stress is one of the leading causes of stomach ulcers. When the body is in a stressed “fight or flight” state, digestion is inhibited.

***

## Can stress cause heartburn?

Yes, stress can indeed cause heartburn. Stress diverts blood flow away from the digestive system, including the stomach, leading to lower hydrochloric acid (HCl) production. Decreased HCl impairs the signal to close the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), allowing acid to reflux into the esophagus, causing heartburn and indigestion. Stress management techniques are associated with better digestive health. Managing stress can help prevent the body from decreasing stomach acid production, which is crucial for proper digestion. In addition, stress is cited as a leading cause of stomach ulcers, which can exacerbate heartburn.

***

## Can sucralose raise your blood sugar?

Sucralose is a zero-carb sweetener and won’t directly raise blood sugar levels. However, there is evidence that sucralose may stimulate certain taste receptors that trigger metabolic changes linked to increased blood sugar and insulin levels.

***

## Can the brain function effectively without carbohydrates?

Dr. Berg talks about the fuel source of the brain. Your brain can run on alternative fuel sources and you do not have to consume carbs or glucose to get energy. It can run on ketones, which is the byproduct of fat. If it needs glucose, it can make it from protein (dietary) and fat.

***

## Can the consumption of yeast contribute to the development of yeast infections or candida infections in individuals?

The answer is no. There are good forms of yeast and bad forms of yeast. To destroy the bad yeast, you need to consume more good yeast. Kefir is the best source of yeast for helping with yeast infections. You can find kefir the health foods store. Make sure you get organic, whole-milk kefir without added flavors.

Microbes are not all bad—they are essential to the body’s natural functioning. This includes yeast.

## Can vitamin deficiencies contribute to low back pain

Lower back pain, especially chronic pain, is often treated with medications, but understanding the root causes can lead to long-term relief. Nutritional deficiencies play a significant role in back pain:

1\. **Vitamin D**: Deficiency can cause bone pain, inflammation, soft bones, and skeletal problems in children. Magnesium and boron deficiencies can also affect vitamin D levels, leading to back issues.

2\. **Vitamin K2**: Deficiency can result in stenosis, arthritis, bone spurs, and calcium deposits. Vitamin K2 works synergistically with vitamin D.

3\. **Vitamin E**: Deficiency can cause back weakness and atrophy. Prefer tocotrienol complexes or wheat germ oil over tocopherols.

4\. **Manganese**: Deficiency can lead to disc problems, collagen issues, and an increased risk of scoliosis.

Other contributors to back pain include an imbalance of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, a high sugar and carbohydrate diet, kidney stones, and gallstones. Addressing these nutritional deficiencies and dietary factors can help alleviate chronic back pain.

***

## Can you reverse alcoholic liver disease?

To improve liver health after drinking, it’s crucial to support liver cell function with a nutritious liver cleanse diet rich in green leafy vegetables, broccoli sprouts, and turmeric. In addition, certain supplements, including milk thistle, CoQ10, and astaxanthin, have been found to mitigate the adverse effects of alcohol and promote liver cell regeneration.

***

## Correlation Between Magnesium Deficiency and Muscle Stiffness

There is a correlation between magnesium deficiency and muscle stiffness or cramps in the morning.

Here's why:

* **Muscle Relaxation:** Magnesium is crucial for muscle relaxation. It acts as a natural calcium channel blocker, preventing excessive calcium influx into muscle cells, which can lead to contraction and stiffness.
* **Electrolyte Balance:** Magnesium plays a vital role in maintaining electrolyte balance, which is crucial for proper muscle function. Imbalances may lead to muscle cramps and spasms, often more pronounced in the morning due to the natural dip in magnesium levels.
* **Energy Production:** Magnesium is also involved in energy production within muscle cells. A deficiency can lead to fatigue and weakness, making muscles feel stiff and sluggish.
* **Circadian Rhythm:** Magnesium levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day, being lowest in the morning. This can contribute to increased muscle tension and stiffness upon waking.

If you have a magnesium deficiency or any symptoms associated with magnesium deficiency, please don't hesitate to contact your healthcare provider for guidance.

***

## Could a deficiency in vitamin B12 be contributing to my respiratory difficulties during physical activities?

Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in the production of red blood cells, and a deficiency can lead to conditions such as pernicious anemia. Anemia may also stem from deficiencies in folic acid or iron, which can contribute to feelings of fatigue or a lack of energy. It's important to note that B12 is primarily obtained from animal products. However, even if you consume these foods, inadequate hydrochloric acid levels can hinder your ability to extract this essential vitamin from meat proteins. Consequently, various factors can impede B12 absorption, and a deficiency can certainly leave you feeling winded, particularly during physical exertion, such as climbing inclines.

***

## Could a racing mind indicate a vitamin deficiency?

If your adrenal glands are being overworked, that can cause excessive thinking, which means your mind is working to solve problems 24/7. This can be very draining and usually affects your sleep. Social media, cell phones, and texting can all keep your adrenals working, leading to overthinking. Try techniques to reduce stress and overstimulation from electronics, as well as taking vitamins that support your adrenals.

## Could excessive intake of vitamin K2 contribute to the formation of bone spurs?

No, excessive intake of vitamin K2 does not cause bone spurs. The body naturally regulates the absorption and utilization of vitamin K2, preventing any risk of overaccumulation that could lead to bone spurs.

***

## Could hormonal imbalances contribute to the onset or progression of Alzheimer's disease?

As you age, your hormone levels change. One of the hormones that is increased by aging is luteinizing hormone (LH). LH has to do with male and female reproductive systems and it increases hormones like estrogen and testosterone. Based on recent studies, there is a connection between Alzheimer’s and high levels of luteinizing hormone (LH). Melatonin was found as a good remedy to lower the LH.

***

## Could the consumption of apple cider vinegar lead to diarrhea?

Apple cider vinegar may induce diarrhea due to its acetic acid content and its effect on gut microbiota, potentially signaling an imbalance in the gut microbiome. If you experience diarrhea after consumption, it is advisable to reduce your intake or discontinue use. While apple cider vinegar has been associated with various health benefits, it may not be suitable for everyone. For ongoing gastrointestinal issues, a comprehensive evaluation, such as a stool analysis, can help identify any significant microbial imbalances. Additionally, considering a lower dosage or exploring the use of apple cider vinegar in pill form may help alleviate symptoms.

***

## Could the consumption of nutritional yeast contribute to the development of constipation?

I would recommend exploring other factors, as nutritional yeast is unlikely to cause constipation due to its minimal caloric content. It's worth examining other dietary changes you may have made. For some individuals, excessive salad or greens can lead to digestive issues, while for others, insufficient greens may be the problem. Consider reviewing any recent additions to your diet that could be contributing to the issue.

***

## Could the consumption of phytoestrogens potentially exacerbate the symptoms associated with estrogen dominance?

Nope! What happens is the plant estrogens compete for the stronger estrogens that are creating a problem, and so they're more protective. They help balance the estrogen ratios because you have three different estrogens and it puts you in a better place, estrogen-wise, in a more protective against cancer place, and so no it's not going to make things worse at all. And this is why if someone does have estrogen dominance, we recommend things like cruciferous vegetables, because a lot of the properties are they have phytoestrogens, and this is also why I would recommend flaxseed oil, and it just so happens that these phytoestrogens are basically anti-carcinogenic.

***

## Did you know that a high-sugar diet can deplete your body's vitamin B1?

**Did you know that a high-sugar diet can deplete your body's vitamin B1?** This essential vitamin, also known as thiamine, is crucial for nerve health and energy production.

**Why is this a problem?**

A vitamin B1 deficiency can lead to:

* **Restless legs syndrome:** This is because a lack of B1 can cause fluid retention and lactic acid buildup.
* **Complications related to diabetes:** Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are linked to B1 deficiency.

**Could you be low in vitamin B1?**

Watch out for these warning signs:

* **Nervous system issues:** Nervous tension, irritability, restlessness, brain fog, confusion, personality changes, low tolerance to stress, loss of coordination
* **Physical symptoms:** Air hunger, numbness in feet and/or fingertips, hand tremors, low pulse rate, headaches, constipation, insomnia

**How to boost your B1 levels:**

* **Diet:** Include these excellent sources of B1 in your diet:
  * Pork, beef, and organ meats
  * Eggs
  * Fish
  * Nuts
  * Unfortified nutritional yeast
* **Supplements:** Consider these forms of B1, especially if you have blood sugar concerns:
  * **Allithiamine:** A fat-soluble form that easily enters the brain.
  * **Benfotiamine:** Another fat-soluble form that may be beneficial for blood sugar regulation.

If you suspect you have a vitamin B1 deficiency, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.

## Do eggs cause heart disease?

No, eggs do not increase the risk of heart disease. Studies that claim this are flawed and are typically observational studies that can be easily manipulated.

***

## Do healthy individuals require dietary supplements?

Certainly! Achieving optimal health often requires more than just avoiding medications and managing weight. Even if you feel healthy, it's challenging to get all necessary nutrients from food due to depleted soils in the US. This can lead to deficiencies that affect energy levels, inflammation, digestion, adrenal function, and sleep. Supplements can bridge these gaps, especially crucial for detoxification and providing nutrients not adequately supplied by diet alone. I've developed supplements specifically to address these needs and support overall health where it may be weakest due to individual histories and dietary limitations.

***

## Do I really need fiber to avoid constipation?

Constipation is congestion in your gut—you have too much stool. Fiber increases stool volume. Fiber also causes your microbes to create fermentation, which leads to gas and bloating. Some studies suggest that consuming fiber can even worsen conditions like chronic constipation or SIBO. The biggest mistake people make when dealing with constipation is consuming more fiber.

How to deal with constipation naturally:

1\. Reduce your fiber

2\. Talk to your doctor about whether or not it’s a side effect of a medication (and what to do if it is)

3\. Consume vitamin B1

4\. Lower your stress

5\. Take bile salts

6\. Take a probiotic

7\. Do intermittent fasting

8\. Consume a moderate amount of protein

9\. Consume betaine hydrochloride and apple cider vinegar

10\. Consume magnesium and potassium

***

## Do Keto and fasting Increase stress hormones?

Do keto and fasting increase stress hormones? The answer is no.

Some people believe that it appears to be stressful on the body because you're starving the body of glucose. However, a person has fat on their body to be used as fuel. Logically, our bodies are meant to run off of fat between meals.

Cortisol is a stress hormone. It is also called glucocorticoid. One of the major functions of cortisol is to keep your blood sugars from getting too low. It releases stored glucose or causes the production of glucose to maintain blood sugar levels. This isn't a stress event; it's a normal thing that occurs in the body.

It takes about three days for the body to adapt from burning glucose to burning fat. Cortisol can rise a little bit when a person goes through the three-day keto-adaptation phase, but then it levels out.

When you run your body on glucose, it is very stressful for the body, and you can't tap into your own fat. However, when you get into ketosis, you could go from a stress state to a much higher level of calmness and a state of well-being. Burning fat or being in ketosis is a non-stressful state. Keep in mind, that when you start keto and fasting, it's important to take electrolytes and B vitamins.

## Do low fat diets cause gallstones?

### **The Myth of Low-Fat Diets and Gallstones**

Contrary to the misconception that a low-fat diet can ward off gallstones, it is [bile deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-know-if-you-have-bile-deficiency) caused by high insulin levels or other factors like high estrogen, birth control pills, and pregnancy, which is responsible for their formation.

Fats are crucial in triggering bile release, which helps dissolve gallstones.

#### **The Role of Fats in Bile Release**

Fats are not the enemy when [preventing gallstones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-low-fat-diet-to-prevent-gallstones-myth); they're our allies. Consuming fatty foods triggers our body to produce bile and discharge it into the small intestine, assisting in breaking down these fats for digestion.

This process keeps your bile flowing regularly, reducing the risk of gallstone formation. So, eating less fat could increase your chances of developing gallstones because it reduces the need for regular bile release.

![Image](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/video-thumbnails/2c86ddc8-26b2-4f40-9d47-58d4be1a8522.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **How High Insulin Levels Deplete Bile**

In addition to fat consumption playing a crucial role in maintaining healthy bile flow, another important factor is keeping insulin levels under control.

High insulin levels can deplete your body's supply of stored bile salts needed for adequate digestion and absorption of dietary fats.

Consuming large amounts of sugar or refined carbohydrates can cause spikes in blood sugar levels, leading to increased insulin production - setting off a chain reaction that ultimately leads to depleted reserves of vital digestive enzymes like bile acids.

## Do organ meats increase testosterone?

Organ meats are rich in zinc and vitamin D, two nutrients linked to reproductive health and the support of hormonal balance, including testosterone.

***

## Do organ meats increase the risk of Mad Cow disease?

Eating certain parts of animals, such as beef tongue, brain, and spinal cord tissues, can potentially increase the risk of mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). However, thoroughly cooking organ meats and purchasing certified BSE-free products helps significantly minimize the risk of BSE.

***

## Do phytoestrogens have the potential to increase estrogen levels?

The answer is no, not more than you already have in your body.

Phytoestrogens only block receptors for bad estrogen, which automatically raise your relative good estrogen. BUT it will not increase your levels more than you already have. So consuming flax oil or seeds for example are safe for men and women.

## Do you absorb less fat after gallbladder removal?

After a gallbladder removal surgery, some people might experience reduced efficiency in digesting and absorbing fats due to a lack of concentrated bile storage. However, many individuals adapt over time as the liver produces bile that continuously trickles into the small intestines.

***

## Do you have salad bloating syndrome?

Experiencing bloating after eating salad? You might be one of the many who suffer from Salad Bloating Syndrome. This discomfort isn't just about feeling full; it's often linked to Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) and leaky gut, both of which can lead to nutrient malabsorption and excessive fermentation in the gut.

**Trigger Foods and Dietary Adjustments**

Certain vegetables, particularly those high in lectins like tomatoes and peppers, can be problematic for individuals with increased gut permeability. These lectins can interfere with nutrient absorption and trigger bloating.

To manage symptoms, consider incorporating safe fats like pasture-raised meats, lard, and beef fat, known for their anti-inflammatory properties. Opt for gentler vegetables like cabbage and lettuce over cruciferous options like broccoli and Brussels sprouts.

**Probiotics and Turmeric**

Non-dairy probiotics can be a game-changer in preventing bloating. These beneficial bacteria help break down tough fibers, reducing gas production and promoting healthy digestion.

Turmeric, with its active compound curcumin, offers anti-inflammatory benefits and can help manage gastritis symptoms, often associated with bloating.

**Conclusion**

By understanding the causes and making informed dietary choices, you can manage Salad Bloating Syndrome effectively. Prioritize safe fats, opt for gentler vegetables, and incorporate probiotics and turmeric into your routine for a healthier, happier gut.

## Do you have vertical ridges on your fingernails?

Vertical ridges on nails are typically caused by one of 3 nutrient deficiencies:

1\. Iron deficiency

2\. Zinc deficiency

3\. Biotin deficiency

To determine which nutrient deficiency is causing the vertical ridges on your nails, first, look at your other symptoms. If you have an iron deficiency, you may also experience heavy menstruation and symptoms of anemia. Some people have a genetic problem that causes too much iron. Even with too much iron, you can become anemic because the iron in your body is dysfunctional. Liver problems and blood tests pinpointing a problem with iron could mean your nail ridges are caused by an iron deficiency. Cravings for ice or dirt and feeling cold with cold feet and hands can also signify iron deficiency.

## Does consuming coffee have any adverse effects on liver health?

In fact, coffee has the capacity to protect your liver; it’s hepatoprotective.

The liver’s main job is to detoxify, although overall it has over 500 functions. Coffee has the capacity to protect liver cells and decrease liver enzymes.

**So what’s in coffee that provides this protection?** It’s the phytonutrients (plant-based chemical antioxidants). They help regulate bile. They have anti-inflammatory properties, they can help increase vitamin D, and they stabilize blood sugars.

These phytonutrients can also help lower insulin. Lowered insulin helps your liver because high insulin can damage your liver. Coffee has more antioxidants than tea, even green tea, and red wine. Roasting coffee beans increases the antioxidants. But if you grind the beans and expose the grounds to oxygen, you lose a lot of the antioxidants. So it’s best if there’s a short time between grinding it and drinking it.

**There are many positive things about coffee, but there are also a few negatives.**

First, caffeine can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, responsible for “fight or flight.” It’s like activating your adrenals, causing sleep problems which in turn cause a cascade of health effects. A good idea is to drink just one cup in the morning. If you’re drinking coffee all day and evening, and have fatigue, you’re covering up an underlying problem that needs to be fixed.

**Coffee beans are the most heavily sprayed crop in the world. Choose organic coffee.**

The more caffeine you consume, the more you deplete vitamin B1 (thiamine), calcium and potassium. You may need supplements to replace those.

## Does Eating Eggs Increase Your Risk of Dying from Heart Disease?

Out of ten recent studies on eggs and heart disease, all of the studies were observational, and all but two of the studies were self-reported.

Studies that require people to recall everything that they’ve eaten over a period of time are generally inaccurate. People often forget what they’ve eaten and focus on the positive things they can remember eating rather than reporting the negative.

Out of ten recent studies on eggs and heart disease, all of the studies were observational, and all but two of the studies were self-reported.

Studies that require people to recall everything that they’ve eaten over a period of time are generally inaccurate. People often forget what they’ve eaten and focus on the positive things they can remember eating rather than reporting the negative. Questionnaires do not prove causation. There was also a conflict of interest in many of these studies.

Eggs are one of the most nutrient-dense foods you can consume. The egg yolk contains almost every nutrient except vitamin C.

Egg yolks from pasture-raised eggs are an excellent source of the following: •Vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, B12 •The active form of vitamin A (retinol) •Vitamin E •Vitamin K2 •Vitamin D •Omega-3 fatty acids •Potassium, magnesium, and selenium.

Eggs are the best source of protein next to human breast milk and are one of the best sources of choline.

Egg yolks promote healthy levels of cholesterol. They can increase HDL cholesterol and can increase the size of your LDL cholesterol.

Egg yolks are the perfect combination of protein and fat and can help reduce insulin resistance. Egg yolks contain lutein and zeaxanthin—carotenoids that are most commonly found in vegetables. These carotenoids are more bioavailable in eggs and help protect the eye from macular degeneration and cataracts. They also protect the endothelial tissue inside of your arteries.

Eggs don't cause heart problems—they help with heart problems!

## Does hair loss from vitamin D deficiency grow back?

Vitamin D-related hair loss typically grows back once vitamin D levels are restored to healthy levels. It’s important to note that vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, and it can take up to three months to correct a deficiency with vitamin D supplementation. This explains why it can take a considerable amount of time for hair regrowth to occur.

## Does Intermittent Fasting help with COPD?

COPD is a condition triggered by chronic smoking or pollution that causes an inflamed irritated lung which develops scar tissue and obstructs the lungs capacity to receive oxygen and eliminates oxygen.

COPD Symptoms

• Coughing

• Mucus

• Shortness of Breath

• Chronic Adrenals

It is highly recommended to do the combination of the healthy ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting.

Reducing carbs will reduce inflammation and oxidative damage in the body.

1\. Intermittent Fasting is going to drop the inflammation + help clean up scar tissue

2\. Vitamin D (High) and Vitamin K2

3\. Hyperbaric

4\. Pneumatrophin PMG (Standard Process)

***

## Does long term fasting affect the menstrual cycle?

Yes, it will. Dr Berg has recommended Dr. Mindy Pelz on that topic.

***

## Does magnesium deficiency cause migraines?

The link between magnesium levels and migraines in the morning is supported by research suggesting that:

**Magnesium Deficiency and Migraines:** Studies have shown a correlation between low magnesium levels and an increased frequency and severity of migraines.

* Magnesium plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter regulation, blood vessel tone, and nerve function, all of which are implicated in migraine development.
* **Circadian Rhythm of Magnesium:** Magnesium levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day, being lowest in the morning. This dip in magnesium can trigger migraines in susceptible individuals, explaining why migraines are often more frequent in the morning hours.
* **Magnesium's Mechanisms in Migraine Prevention:** Magnesium is believed to work in several ways to prevent migraines, including:
  * Regulating neurotransmitter release, such as glutamate, which can trigger migraines.
  * Preventing blood vessel constriction in the brain, which can contribute to migraine pain.
  * Reducing inflammation, which plays a role in migraine development.

However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional if you are experiencing migraines before starting any new supplements, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.

## Does my diet affect my knee pain and arthritis?

The foods you eat can have a significant impact on knee pain and arthritis. It all comes down to the balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in your diet.

[Omega-6 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-6-fats-and-inflammation) are found in many common foods, such as vegetable oils and processed snacks. While some omega-6 is necessary for health, consuming too much can contribute to inflammation in the body, which can worsen [knee pain](https://www.drberg.com/blog/knee-pain-relief) and arthritis symptoms.

#### **The Impact of Omega-6 Fatty Acids on Inflammation**

Omega-6 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat that is essential for various bodily functions. However, when consumed in excess, they can promote inflammation.

In fact, research has shown that a diet high in omega-6 fatty acids can increase the production of pro-inflammatory compounds in the body, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

These compounds can contribute to joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in people with knee arthritis. Some common sources of omega-6 fatty acids include:

* Soybean oil
* Corn oil
* Sunflower oil
* Safflower oil
* Processed snacks and baked goods
* Fried foods

## Does my diet impact my dental health?

### **Diet's Impact on Dental Problems**

Although clove oil can be effective for toothaches, it is not a comprehensive solution, and dietary changes may be necessary to address the root cause. Most dental issues stem from diet, especially sugar intake. So, if you always reach for clove oil, it's time to examine your plate.

#### **Sugar's Effect on Teeth**

Sugar and dental problems go hand in hand. Bacteria in your mouth feed on sugar, producing acid that attacks the tooth enamel, leading to cavities.

* **Tooth decay:** High sugar intake leads to cavities.
* [**Gum disease**](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-causes-bleeding-gums)**:** Excess sugar causes plaque buildup, leading to gingivitis.
* **Tooth loss:** Advanced gum disease can damage bones supporting teeth, leading to tooth loss.

Excess sugar consumption can impair the body's natural defenses, increasing the risk of developing abscesses and periodontal diseases.

#### **Long-Term Solutions through Diet Changes**

For long-term dental solutions, a change in diet is the best option. Reducing sugar intake is critical because less sugar means less harmful bacterial activity in our mouths.

* **Avoid processed foods:** Whole foods offer essential vitamins and minerals for healthy teeth and gums.
* **Limited snacking:** Frequent snacking provides a constant fuel source for harmful bacteria. Stick to 2-3 balanced meals per day.
* **Increase water intake:** Drinking water rinses away food particles and aids saliva production, neutralizing destructive acids.

***

## Does my lifestyle choice deplete calcium?

Certain lifestyle factors, even seemingly unrelated ones, can also deplete your calcium reserves:

* High Protein Intake: While protein is vital, excessively high intake can potentially contribute to calcium loss through urine.
* High Sodium Intake: Similarly, excessive sodium intake may impact calcium balance.
* Excessive Caffeine and Soft Drinks: High caffeine consumption, especially from coffee or certain sodas, may contribute to calcium loss. The high phosphorus content in some sodas can also interfere with calcium balance. This doesn't mean you must entirely forgo your morning cup but be mindful of your overall consumption.
* Refined Sugar Consumption: Excessive refined sugar intake can negatively affect calcium absorption.

## Does potassium deficiency cause diabetes?

Diuretics are commonly used to treat high blood pressure. But, they come with side effects, including an increased risk of developing diabetes. On the flip side, ace inhibitors, also used to treat high blood pressure, protect against diabetes and lower the risk of diabetes. I believe the big difference between these two drugs, when it comes to diabetes risk, is what they do to potassium.

Diuretics deplete potassium, and without enough potassium, insulin can't be released very well. A deficiency of insulin can then lead to diabetes. Ace inhibitors increase potassium by helping to prevent the loss of potassium. So why do we even need a drug—why aren't we just consuming more potassium? Many people support healthy blood pressure and healthy blood sugar levels by taking potassium.

The RDAs for potassium are 4700 mg. It might surprise you, but bananas aren't a good source of potassium. A few of the best sources of potassium are:

• Leafy greens

• Potatoes

• Avocado

• Electrolyte powder

## Does shoulder pain go away?

Shoulder pain can resolve over time with appropriate treatment such as therapeutic exercises and lifestyle modifications like improving sleep posture.

However, some cases may require more advanced interventions, such as surgery, depending on the severity and underlying causes.

***

## Does stress decrease dopamine?

**Long-term stress elevates cortisol and impacts dopamine, affecting pleasure and motivation. Symptoms include reduced pleasure, motivation, alertness, and increased stress.**

**Steps to mitigate:**

1\. Prioritize sleep.

2\. Reduce exposure to fearful stimuli like news.

3\. Engage in regular exercise outdoors.

4\. Address and minimize sources of stress.

***

## Does stress raise the pH of stomach acid?

Stress will lower stomach acid production but does not raise stomach acid pH.

Stress diverts blood flow away from the digestive system, including the stomach, leading to lower production of hydrochloric acid (HCl). Decreased HCl impairs the signal to close the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), allowing acid to reflux into the esophagus, causing heartburn and indigestion.

***

## Does the brain only run on glucose?

People often have an idea that your body — especially your brain — can only run on glucose. But that’s not true! You can run your body on ketones, which provide about forty to seventy percent of the energy you need. Of course, the question becomes, what kind of fuel makes up the difference?There will always be a small amount of glucose, but your body can run on fatty acids. Fat turns into ketones and fatty acids.

Your brain is a little different; it can use ketones for seventy percent of its fuel, with the rest coming from lactate or glucose. Where will you get the glucose if you don’t want to eat carbohydrates? Your body makes its own in a process called gluconeogenesis. Your body uses fat and protein to make glucose. Certain amino acids in protein turn into glucose, as does a component of fat which breaks down into glycerol, then converts to glucose. Your body can easily get the glucose it needs from fat and protein. You don’t need carbohydrates to supply glucose.

***

## Does the consumption of water play a role in the formation of kidney stones?

The most common type of kidney stone is calcium oxalate. Consuming calcium helps prevent stones by binding with oxalates in the digestive system, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream and accumulation in the kidneys. Drinking mineral water does not cause kidney stones.

**Foods high in oxalates:**

\- Almonds

\- Spinach

\- Kiwi

\- Beets

\- Chocolate

**Recommendations:**

\- Avoid high-oxalate foods if prone to stones

\- Consume calcium with oxalate-rich foods

\- Prefer calcium citrate, magnesium, orotate, or lactate over calcium carbonate

\- Maintain adequate fluid intake (at least 2.5 liters daily)

***

## Does the Gallbladder absorb fat?

No, the gallbladder does not directly absorb fat. Its primary function is to store and concentrate bile produced by the liver. Bile aids in breaking down dietary fats into smaller particles, which are then absorbed by the small intestine.

***

## Does the sun have any effect on eye health?

Protecting our skin from harmful UV rays is crucial, and so is protecting our eyes from sun damage. Prolonged exposure to UV radiation harms the eyes and can accelerate cataracts and macular degeneration.

Make it a habit to wear sunglasses that offer 100% UV protection whenever you are outside, even on cloudy days, as UV rays can penetrate clouds.

Prioritizing eye protection, especially during peak sun hours, significantly contributes to maintaining good eye health. Sunglasses are a simple way to protect your eye health.

***

## Does zinc carnosine help manage stomach acidity?

Zinc carnosine supports balanced stomach acid production, which prevents excessive stomach acidity linked to acid reflux and heartburn and an increased risk of gastric ulcers.

## Effective Nutritional Treatments for Common Eye Conditions

### **Effective Nutritional Treatments for Common Eye Conditions**

While a balanced diet is essential for overall eye health, certain nutrients can also be used to target specific eye conditions.

From pesky allergies to more serious autoimmune disorders, the right combination of vitamins and minerals can work wonders in alleviating symptoms and promoting healing. Let's take a closer look at some effective nutritional treatments for common eye issues.

#### **Treating Conjunctivitis with Zinc and Colloidal Silver**

[Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye](https://www.drberg.com/blog/colloidal-silver-pink-eye), is a highly contagious inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin membrane that covers the white part of the eye.

While viral conjunctivitis often clears up, supplementing with zinc and colloidal silver can speed up the healing process.

Zinc has potent antiviral properties that can help fight off the infection, while colloidal silver acts as a natural antibiotic to reduce inflammation and prevent secondary bacterial infections.

To avoid any potential side effects, be sure to use a high-quality, sterile solution and follow the recommended dosage.

#### **Alleviating Allergy Symptoms with Vitamin A**

If you suffer from seasonal allergies, you know how miserable they can make your eyes feel - red, itchy, watery, and just plain uncomfortable. But did you know that vitamin A can be a powerful ally in the fight against allergy symptoms?

Vitamin A helps to support the health of the mucous membranes in your eyes, which act as a natural barrier against allergens and irritants.

[Cod liver oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-real-reason-why-you-should-take-cod-liver-oil-dr-berg) is an excellent vitamin A source, and a daily supplement can help reduce inflammation and soothe allergy-induced redness and irritation.

#### **The Anti-inflammatory Benefits of Vitamin D for Autoimmune Disorders**

[Autoimmune disorders](https://www.drberg.com/blog/whats-at-the-root-of-an-autoimmune-condition) like uveitis and Sjogren's syndrome can cause severe inflammation in the eyes, leading to pain, vision changes, and even permanent damage if left untreated.

But research shows that vitamin D can be a powerful anti-inflammatory agent for managing these conditions.

[Vitamin D](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-facts-about-vitamin-d-you-never-knew) helps to regulate the immune system and prevent it from attacking healthy tissues in the body, including the eyes.

Supplementing with vitamin D3, the most bioavailable form of the nutrient, can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms of autoimmune-related eye disorders. Just be sure to work with your doctor to determine the right dosage for your specific needs.

In addition to these targeted treatments, maintaining adequate vitamin A levels is crucial for preventing dry eyes, a common symptom of many eye conditions.

If you struggle with vitamin A absorption due to digestive issues, adding purified bile salts to your supplement regimen can help enhance absorption and ensure your eyes are getting the nourishment they need.

## Exercise for Healthy Aging

### **Exercise for Healthy Aging**

Aging doesn't mean we have to give up our vitality. With regular exercise, we can combat the effects of aging and maintain our health into old age.

#### **Maintaining Muscle Mass**

As we get older, muscle loss is a common problem. Did you know that regular exercise can help to sustain muscle mass and strength even as we age? It's true. Exercise helps preserve muscle mass and strength as you age, keeping you active and independent longer.

#### **Fighting Chronic Diseases**

Sedentary habits contribute to over 35 chronic illnesses, including obesity, diabetes, cancer, and stroke.[Research shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4241367) that regular physical activity reduces risk factors associated with these diseases, making it an essential tool in healthy aging.

#### **Promoting Brain Health**

Your brain also benefits from a good workout. Exercise stimulates neurogenesis - growth of new neurons - which improves memory function and mood regulation. Studies indicate that this can lower the risk of dementia or other cognitive disorders in later life.

#### **Aiding Metabolic Health**

If managing weight or controlling blood sugar levels has been a struggle, consider incorporating more physical activity into your routine.

Regular workouts improve insulin sensitivity and aid in weight management, reducing risks related to metabolic syndrome like fatty liver disease. Evidence suggests this approach leads to better overall health and longevity.

## Fatty Acid Deficiency - Despite Taking Essential Fatty Acids - EFA?

I heard from someone who had symptoms of an essential fatty acid deficiency, even though they were taking essential fatty acids (EFA). EFAs are omega 3 and omega 6. Here are the symptoms of a deficiency:

● Small red bumps on the back of your arms

● Dry, scaly skin

● Hair loss

● Loss of pigment in your hair

● Heart issues

● Vision problems

● Mood issues

● Problems with cognitive function

If you’re taking essential fatty acids and not seeing a change in your body, then you know you’re not absorbing them. Here are the potential reasons why:

● Pancreatic insufficiency

● Insufficient stomach acid

● Intestinal issues like irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn’s

● Gallbladder problems such as lack of gallbladder, or one that’s congested

● Liver issues such as fatty liver, hepatitis, or cirrhosis

The last two on this list are the most common reasons why someone isn’t properly absorbing essential fatty acids. If you have a big belly, chances are you have a fatty liver. An ultrasound can confirm. This results from insulin resistance, which itself is caused by consuming things like alcohol and refined sugars, and eating far too often. As well, if you have a fatty liver then chances are you have a congested gallbladder.

These are good sources of essential fatty acids:

● Eggs

● Fish

● Fish oil

● Olives and olive oil

● Vegetables

● Nuts

● Seeds

● Grass-fed animal products such as meat and cheese

I hope this answered the question about how you can develop an essential fatty acid deficiency!

## Folic Acid and B12 Deficiency

### **The Masking Effect of Folic Acid on B12 Deficiency**

[Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate](https://www.drberg.com/blog/avoid-folic-acid-and-take-folate-as-methyl-folate), a B vitamin that's essential for DNA synthesis and red blood cell production. It's often added to fortified foods like breakfast cereals and breads to help prevent neural tube defects in pregnancy.

But while folic acid fortification has been successful in reducing the incidence of these birth defects, it may also be masking a hidden problem: vitamin B12 deficiency.

![Pills forming B12 shape](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/yellow-pills-forming-shape-b12-alphabet-0.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **Fortified Foods and Nutrient Interactions**

The problem with folic acid is that it can correct the megaloblastic anemia caused by B12 deficiency, but it doesn't address the underlying deficiency itself.

This means that someone could have a serious B12 deficiency but not show any obvious symptoms because the folic acid is masking the anemia.

Over time, untreated B12 deficiency can lead to irreversible neurological damage, even if the anemia is being corrected by folic acid. This is why it's so important to test for B12 deficiency, especially in older adults and vegetarians/vegans who may be at a higher risk.

While food fortification can be a useful tool for preventing nutrient deficiencies, it's important to be aware of potential interactions between nutrients like folic acid and B12.

If you're relying on fortified foods as a major source of your B vitamins, make sure also to include plenty of B12-rich foods in your diet or consider supplementing to ensure you're meeting your needs.

## Gallstones vs. Kidney Stones

### **Gallstones vs. Kidney Stones**

Understanding the [difference between gallstones and kidney stones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-do-stones-develop-in-your-kidney-and-gallbladder) is essential if you want to prevent gallbladder disease.

Both conditions involve hard deposits forming in your body, but they occur in different areas and have unique causes.

![Image](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/video-thumbnails/0aaff09d-5988-4a10-87c1-3ae29fd2b517.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **Kidney Stones**

Kidney stones develop when calcium oxalate accumulates in your kidneys—a process often influenced by dehydration rather than fat consumption.

Drinking lots of water daily helps dilute substances that could form kidney stones while promoting regular urination, which aids their expulsion from the body before they grow too large.

Although both conditions share similar names—and even some common symptoms—the strategies for preventing them differ greatly based on their distinct underlying causes.

## Healthy Habits for Managing Illness

### **Healthy Habits for Managing Illness**

Iron is essential, but too much can feed disease-causing microbes. Luckily, there are safer alternatives that support immunity without encouraging microbial growth.

#### **Immunity-Boosting Nutrients**

A balanced diet rich in essential nutrients strengthens the body's defenses against harmful pathogens without promoting their growth like excess iron might.

* [**Vitamin C**](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-4-things-about-vitamin-c-that-will-blow-you-away)**:** Stimulates white blood cell production to fight infections. It is found in broccoli.
* [**Zinc**](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-unexpected-amazing-benefits-of-zinc-that-you-ve-rarely-heard-about)**:** Aids cell division and growth while having an anti-inflammatory effect. Found in oysters, beef, and pumpkin seeds.
* [**Selenium**](https://www.drberg.com/blog/12-amazing-benefits-of-selenium)**:** Boosts defense against bacterial and viral infections. It is found in Brazil nuts, seafood, turkey, and chicken.

These nutrients not only support immune function during sickness but also aid recovery.

![Woman eating vegetables](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/young-happy-woman-eating-healthy-salad.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **Dietary Changes for Better Health**

During sickness, nutritional changes can enhance overall health status:

* **Eat Whole Foods:** Unprocessed or minimally processed foods contain more natural nutrients than heavily processed ones.
* **Maintain Hydration:** Staying hydrated helps maintain bodily functions. Consume eight glasses of H2O daily or more if experiencing signs of dehydration such as fever, perspiration, vomiting, looseness of the bowels, or other symptoms.
* **Cut Back On Sugar:** Sugar lacks nutritional value and weakens the immune response by reducing the white blood cell activity necessary to fight infection. Limit consumption of sugary drinks, snacks, and desserts, particularly when under the weather.

Advise a medical specialist before adjusting your diet or taking dietary supplements to ensure safety and efficiency.

## How can fatty liver disease contribute to a slowdown in thyroid function?

Fatty liver disease can stem from excessive alcohol consumption or a diet high in sugars and refined carbohydrates, leading to insulin spikes and insulin resistance. This condition, known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), causes liver inflammation and scar tissue formation.

Common signs include abdominal obesity and can be diagnosed via ultrasound, revealing diminished liver function and reduced bile production. A fatty liver impairs cholesterol regulation and interferes with thyroid hormone conversion (T4 to T3), potentially leading to hypothyroidism and metabolic slowdown.

Addressing these issues with a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting can alleviate insulin resistance symptoms. Increasing intake of cruciferous and other vegetables, along with choline supplements, supports the removal of fat from the liver, aiding in the reversal of fatty liver disease over time.

## How can I determine if I am salt sensitive or potassium deficient?

People that are salt sensitive are usually told to stay away from sodium. But did you know that we need 1000mg of sodium and 4700mg of potassium RDA? If you are deficient in sodium, you experience headaches, fatigue, lethargy, nausea, and weak muscles. Sodium and potassium work together. Instead of accepting the diagnosis that you need to cut down your salt, try to increase your potassium intake to 4700mg daily. This will especially help with high blood pressure. Increase your potassium by taking supplements, but it's best to eat 7-10 cups of vegetables.

## How can I end seizures?

**Common triggers of seizures:**

• Fever

• Head injury

• Brain infection

• Choking

• Alcohol

• Drug withdrawal

• Extremely low blood sugar

• Drugs

• Toxins

• Stress

• High blood pressure

Data shows that keto is effective in eliminating seizures by a factor of 50 to 70 percent. But it's important to be on the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. The keto diet for epilepsy also includes more fat than protein. Ketones are a byproduct of fat. Fat and ketones are the primary fuel source that our bodies should run on—not glucose. It's also the preferred fuel source of the brain.

**Top potential benefits of ketones for seizures:**

• They have anticonvulsant properties

• They stabilize the excitability of the neurons

• They modulate neurotransmitters

• They support the brain, including the hippocampus

• They increase the hippocampus's mitochondrial biogenesis

• They protect the brain and neurons against oxidative stress

• They increase the ATP in the neurons to allow them to function better

## How can I end the hypertension?

Blood pressure problems are very common. Today, we’re going to talk about blood pressure and the best natural hypertension remedies. The problems with high blood pressure can extend way beyond the heart. High blood pressure can affect the brain, eyes, and kidneys. High blood pressure can also increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. In my opinion, two common causes of high blood pressure are low magnesium and low vitamin D. But hypertension could also be the result of another health issue, like hypoxia.

The typical treatment for hypertension involves lowering sodium intake or taking a diuretic. But, diuretics deplete potassium and magnesium, which could both be potential causes of high blood pressure in the first place. Calcium channel blockers and ace inhibitors are also used to treat high blood pressure, but those come with serious potential side effects. A research study also found that taking aspirin every day may not have any benefits.

Nitric oxide, on the other hand, supports the inner layer of the arteries and may help lower blood pressure. A certain enzyme in the body helps make nitric oxide. But, this enzyme can be inhibited if you have a specific genetic variation.

**One of the best natural remedies for hypertension is L-arginine.** L-arginine supports the production of nitric oxide in the body. Other great natural remedies for high blood pressure are foods like garlic and celery, which you can easily include in your diet. You may also want to take tocotrienols to support the arteries and make sure you’re getting plenty of potassium, magnesium, and vitamin D3. Changing your diet is another crucial part of dealing with high blood pressure.

## How can I fix the deficiencies behind the vertical ridges on my fingernails?

Most of your biotin is made by your microbes, so a history of antibiotic use can contribute to biotin deficiency. Biotin deficiency symptoms include brittle hair, thin nails, neurological problems, and peripheral neuropathy. Biotin, zinc, and iron control collagen. A deficiency in either of these nutrients can cause vertical lines on the nails.

Once you identify which nutrient you are most likely deficient in, you can increase your intake of certain foods or supplements to fix the problem.

Grass-fed liver pills or spleen extract pills are the best option for an iron deficiency.

To increase zinc, consume more shellfish, oysters, and grass-fed beef. If you choose to take a supplement for zinc, take 50 grams in a blend with other trace minerals, including copper.

If you have a biotin deficiency, try increasing your biotin with a supplement. Take a good probiotic to support gut health, which will naturally help increase biotin.

***

## How can I flush excess zinc from the body?

To flush excess zinc from your system, increase copper intake through diet or supplementation, stay hydrated, maintain trace mineral balance, and avoid zinc supplements and zinc-rich foods. In addition, it’s recommended to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

***

## How can I get rid of excess uric acid naturally?

Managing excess uric acid levels, often associated with conditions like gout or kidney stones, can be effectively addressed through natural approaches:

1\. **Avoiding Fructose:** Limiting consumption of sugary foods and beverages helps to lower uric acid levels.

2\. **Consideration of Carnivore Diet:** Some individuals experience relief by reducing carbohydrates and sugars, focusing on a meat-based diet.

3\. **Understanding Uric Acid Dynamics:** Initially, ketogenic diets may temporarily elevate uric acid levels as the body adapts, potentially providing antioxidant benefits. Intermittent fasting can aid in normalizing uric acid levels over time.

For personalized advice and detailed strategies, consulting with healthcare professionals or referring to comprehensive resources is recommended.

## How can I handle the bloating for good?

Ninety percent of digestion occurs in the small intestine, where bile and secondary bile salts made by your microbes break down your food. The large intestine, small intestine, and pancreas release enzymes to aid digestion. Around 20% of these enzymes are made by your microbes. Bloating is caused by a problem with digestion. The type, amount, and diversity of your gut bacteria directly affect bloating. This often depends on if you’ve taken antibiotics and how much you’ve taken over time.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics significantly reduce your microbes, and they do not come back! If you’re missing any of your gut microbes, you’ll experience bloating, gas, burping, constipation, and more. Other chemicals in the environment that mimic antibiotics can also cause a bloated belly. Glyphosate, birth control pills, steroids, anti-depression medications, PPIs, artificial sweeteners, fluoride, and statins can all contribute to bloating.

So many people can not properly digest food anymore because they don’t have all of their microbes in sufficient quantities. A high-quality probiotic is a great solution to bloating. Along with probiotics, consume fermented foods regularly, such as kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut, and pickles. Apple cider vinegar and kombucha can also help awaken dormant microbes by acidifying their environment. These microbes help support your bile and enzymes, helping you digest food, which takes stress off your organs.

## How can I manage estrogen dominance?

To help manage estrogen dominance, Dr. Berg recommends several natural strategies and supplements to help balance estrogen levels. Here's a summary of his recommendations:

1. **Cruciferous Vegetables**: Incorporating cruciferous vegetables like kale, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts into your diet is beneficial. These vegetables contain compounds that help balance estrogen levels.
2. **DIM Supplement Estrogen Balance**: Dr. Berg recommends the DIM Supplement Estrogen Balance supplement. DIM (Diindolylmethane) is a compound derived from cruciferous vegetables that supports healthy estrogen metabolism and helps balance estrogen levels in the body.
3. **Iodine Supplementation**: Iodine is essential for maintaining a healthy thyroid, which plays a crucial role in hormone regulation, including estrogen. Dr. Berg mentions getting iodine from sea kelp as a natural way to supplement iodine.
4. **Nettle Root**: Nettle root is highlighted as a natural aromatase inhibitor. Aromatase is an enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen. By inhibiting this enzyme, nettle root can help lower estrogen levels.
5. **Organic Meat**: It is recommended that you consume meat from grass-fed animals to avoid GMOs from corn and soy feed, which can influence estrogen levels.

These recommendations aim to support the body's natural hormone balance, reduce high estrogen levels, and address symptoms of estrogen dominance. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement or dietary regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions.

## How can I possibly improve sperm count and quality?

Ways to Increase Sperm Count and Quality:

Dietary Changes:

Avoid Soy Products: Soy has been directly associated with lowering sperm count due to its rich content of isoflavones, which are phytoestrogens and may act as endocrine disruptors. Common soy products include: Keto-friendly bars containing soy isolates Diet shakes Vegetarian or vegan meat substitutes Soy milk Reduce Exposure to Endocrine

Disruptors: Choose Organic Products: Opt for organic foods to avoid exposure to chemicals that can disrupt hormones.

Avoid Phthalates: Use products labeled as "phthalate-free" and avoid fast food, which can be a source of phthalate exposure. Use Microwave-Safe Containers: Ensure that containers and plastic wraps used in microwaves are labeled as "microwave-safe."

Manage Estrogen Levels: Monitor and Reduce Elevated Estrogen:

Elevated estrogen in men can lead to a decline in sperm count and other symptoms such as infertility, erectile dysfunction, and reduced sex drive. Managing estrogen levels can help improve sperm production.

Consider Supplements: Zinc: This mineral is essential for male fertility.

Omega-3 Fatty Acids: These healthy fats can improve sperm quality.

Vitamin E: This antioxidant can help protect sperm from damage.

Healthy Lifestyle Choices:

Follow a Healthy Keto Diet: A diet high in healthy fats and low in processed foods can support overall reproductive health.

## How can I speed up muscle growth?

**Skeletal muscle is crucial for movement, posture, and metabolism. Building muscle requires a combination of high-intensity exercise and adequate protein intake. Aim for 0.8 to 1.5 grams of high-quality protein per kilogram of lean body mass (athletes may need up to 2 grams). To further optimize muscle growth, consider the following strategies:**

* **Creatine Supplementation:** Creatine boosts energy during intense exercise. Load with 20 grams for five days, then maintain with 3 grams daily in a cyclical pattern.
* **Cold Therapy:** Cold showers, immersion, or cryotherapy stimulate fat burning and muscle development by increasing muscle gene expression and reducing inflammation.
* **Intermittent Fasting:** Fasting boosts growth hormone for muscle growth and improves insulin sensitivity, aiding muscle recovery. Aim for two calorie-dense meals daily without snacking.
* **Arginine:** This amino acid promotes growth hormone production. Take 3-6 grams daily on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before workouts.

**Important Note:** Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement or dietary regimen.

## How can I tell if I have high estrogen?

Aside from issues with your menstrual cycle, low progesterone is a sign of too much estrogen because these two hormones balance each other out.

Gallstones can be a sign of estrogen dominance because estrogen helps concentrate cholesterol in the gallbladder. This is why gallstones are sometimes seen after pregnancy due to the spike in estrogen. Thyroid issues can also signify an estrogen imbalance.

## How can I use my feet to determine if I have an ongoing health condition?

The foot receives oxygen and nutrition from the heart through tiny capillaries. The following feet symptoms are also potential signs of diseases.

1\. Peripheral neuropathy

This shows up as numbness or burning in the feet due to low vitamin B1 (thiamine). Benfotiamine, a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1, may help.

2\. Fingers or toes turn blue

This can be related to an overactive sympathetic nervous system. This is often treated medically with calcium channel blockers. Magnesium is a natural calcium channel blocker and the primary regulator of calcium inside the cells. Magnesium glycinate is the most absorbable form of magnesium.

3\. Foot cramps

Foot cramps and charlie horses in the calves are among the earliest signs of magnesium deficiency. Try taking 400 to 800 mg of magnesium glycinate for several weeks to alleviate foot cramps.

4\. Swollen feet

Swelling of feet typically involves diabetes and excess sugar in the blood, which causes sodium and water retention. The solution is to remove sugar from the diet.

5\. Discoloration of lower legs and feet

This is often caused by a circulation problem. Deep vein thrombosis is a condition where you develop clots in the veins of the lower legs. This can cause fluid retention and discoloration of the lower legs and feet.

6\. Big toe pain

Pain in the big toe is usually a symptom of gout caused by too much uric acid. Decreasing oxalates in the diet can sometimes solve this problem. Magnesium can also help decrease oxalates.

## How do cortisol levels influence sleep patterns?

Between about 12am and 2am, you should have the lowest amount of cortisol. The highest level of cortisol is between 6am and 9 am. But, in some cases, cortisol can get higher during the night and counter deep sleep. You might be sleeping, but you’re not getting deep sleep or restful sleep.

There can be a problem with different parts of the brain that are activated and then prevent you from getting restful sleep, all because your cortisol will not turn off. The goal is not to keep cortisol at zero but to help normalize cortisol, so you don’t have anything interfering with your sleep cycles. But, you still need to have the function of cortisol, which is vital.

**What to do about high cortisol:**

• Figure out what’s causing you stress and do what you can to handle it

• Go for long walks (45-60 minutes every day outside and disconnected)

• Try my do it yourself acupressure technique

## How do I address digestive concerns before reintroducing acidic substances?

Suppose you experience digestive issues like stomach irritation or ulcers after consuming apple cider vinegar or kombucha. In that case, giving your digestive system time to heal is essential before reintroducing these acidic substances into your diet.

#### **Healing Strategies**

Several natural remedies can help soothe the stomach lining and promote healing. One effective strategy is to consume foods rich in [chlorophyll](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-power-of-chlorophyll-for-the-gut), such as leafy greens, wheatgrass, and chlorella.

Chlorophyll has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and can help reduce stomach irritation.

Another helpful remedy is to drink cabbage juice or consume fermented foods like sauerkraut. These foods are rich in beneficial bacteria that can help restore the balance of gut flora and promote digestive tract healing.

It's important to note that if you experience persistent burning or irritation in your stomach after consuming apple cider vinegar or kombucha, it may indicate an underlying condition such as an ulcer or gastritis.

It's best to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment in these cases.

## How do I keep my immune system in check?

### **The Immune System: Our Body's Defense Force**

Your immune system is like a highly trained military force, working tirelessly to defend your body against invading pathogens.

It's a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that join forces to identify and neutralize harmful substances like bacteria, viruses, and toxins.

Think of your immune system as having two main branches: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. They work together to keep you healthy but have different roles and strategies.

#### **Understanding Innate vs. Adaptive Immunity**

Your innate immune system is your first line of defense. It includes physical barriers like your skin and mucous membranes and general immune responses like [inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-3-hidden-causes-of-inflammation-you-havent-heard-about) and phagocytosis (where immune cells engulf and destroy invaders).

The innate immune system is non-specific - it attacks anything it recognizes as foreign.

In contrast, the adaptive immune system is more targeted. It develops specific antibodies and immune cells tailored to fight off particular pathogens that you've been exposed to before.

This is why you typically only get diseases like chickenpox once - your adaptive immunity remembers the virus and is ready to fight it off if it ever tries to invade again.

#### **The Role of the Thymus Gland in Immune Training**

The [thymus gland](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-does-our-thymus-shrink-to-nothing-as-we-age) in your chest is like a boot camp for T-cells - a critical part of your adaptive immune system. Immature T-cells are "trained" in the thymus to recognize the difference between your body's own cells and foreign invaders.

This training process is rigorous—only about 30% of T-cells make it through. The rest are eliminated to prevent autoimmune reactions, in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues.

The thymus is most active during childhood and starts to shrink after puberty, but it continues to play a role in immune regulation throughout life.

Did you know that the internal skin of the body covers an area of about 400 square meters? That's a lot of territory for your immune system to patrol. Beneath the surface of your skin, billions of immune cells are constantly on the lookout for any signs of trouble.

## How do I know if I have a stomach ulcer?

The tell-tale burning and gnawing on an empty is the most common sign of an ulcer. Eating will usually soothe an ulcer and aggravate heartburn. Drinking apple cider vinegar mixed with water will help soothe heartburn but aggravate an ulcer. Some doctors will perform an endoscopy to look for an ulcer.

***

## How do I know if my supplement contains maltodextrin?

Iodine mixed with water is a golden color. If you combine iodine with starch, it turns blue. When you add iodine to bread, for example, it turns blue. Or, if you put maltodextrin in water and add a few drops of iodine, the water will turn blue. My brand of electrolyte powder doesn’t have any sugar or maltodextrin in it. However, when we look at a competitor’s electrolyte powder that also claims it doesn’t have sugar or maltodextrin, it turns blue when iodine is added.

Maltodextrin behaves like sugar, spiking insulin, but can be classified on a label as a carb and not a sugar. On the glycemic index, table sugar is at 65, and glucose is at 100—maltodextrin is between 105 and 185. Maltodextrin is the most common starch added to supplements and other products. If there is less than one gram of maltodextrin in a product per serving size, the company doesn’t even have to state it. Maltodextrin can also be found in flavorings, energy gels, sports powders, and even baby formulas. It’s important to be aware that some so-called keto-friendly products can also contain maltodextrin.

***

## How do I test for magnesium deficiency?

While blood tests do provide some insight into circulating magnesium levels, a magnesium loading test is generally considered a more accurate measurement of the body’s total magnesium stores.

This test administers magnesium intravenously and measures urinary output, which provides a more accurate assessment of magnesium status.

## How do Omega-6 fatty acids potentially contribute to the development of clogged arteries?

Omega-6 Fatty acids, as contained in certain oils, can cause inflammation across the body and eventually result in clogged arteries. You should avoid these fatty acids while substituting omega-3 fatty acids that have anti-inflammatory properties.

***

## How do you manage GERD symptoms if you don’t have a gallbladder?

GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) can persist after gallbladder removal due to issues with the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) valve. Here’s a professional approach to alleviate symptoms:

1\. **Enhance Stomach Acid**: Betaine hydrochloride (HCl) supplements can help acidify the stomach, prompting the LES valve to close properly. Begin with three capsules before meals and gradually increase to find the optimal dosage that reduces reflux.

2\. **Adjust Dosage**: Increase betaine HCl intake daily until symptoms improve. This may require adjusting the dosage up to nine or ten capsules per meal initially, maintaining this regimen for several weeks to assess effectiveness.

By addressing stomach acidity with betaine HCl supplementation, you can potentially improve LES function and alleviate GERD symptoms, despite not having a gallbladder. Always consult with a healthcare provider to tailor the approach to your specific health needs.

***

## How does a fatty liver contribute to the onset of arthritis?

There are different stages of liver damage: fatty liver, fatty liver with inflammation, and cirrhosis. Arthritis is inflammation in your joints. How does the inflammation get from the liver to the joints?

There are several mechanisms in play here. Liver fat creates cytokines, which are proteins that cause inflammation. The particular cytokines that liver fat produces increases systemic inflammation—or inflammation throughout your body.

These cytokines released by liver fat are why you can get inflammation in your joints and arthritis when you have liver disease.

To make things worse, cytokines can worsen insulin resistance. Insulin resistance makes getting rid of fat very difficult and increases even more systemic inflammation. This is a feedback loop that gets worse and worse. When the liver is inflamed and filled with scar tissue, bile gets stuck. In turn, this can cause even more inflammation in the body and nutrient deficiencies.

## How does Big Pharma profit off of sick people?

There are over 100 clinical trials supporting that type 2 diabetes can be reversed in as little as 10 weeks. Hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and other chronic diseases can potentially also be reversed with dietary changes. The reversal rate of type 2 diabetes with the standard of care from doctors is 0.1%. In clinical trials with patients following a keto diet, the reversal rate is more than 50%!

Insulin manufacturers and other drug companies primarily fund the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association, so they are subject to direct conflicts of interest. Doctors have been taught to recommend low-fat diets, and there are countless baseless claims that keto is dangerous.

Dietary guidelines significantly influence most Americans. By law, all federal food programs are required to follow these guidelines. Health professionals also use them as the gold standard in nutrition. However, many conflicts of interest are involved in these guidelines, including ties to both Big Food and Big Pharma.

Giving accurate dietary guidelines to the American public is the best way to combat chronic disease.

To get into a healthy state of ketosis, you should eat eggs, dairy, meat, shellfish, vegetables, and low-sugar fruits. Carbohydrates trigger hunger. Without glucose, your body can access your fat stores for energy between meals.

***

## How does calcification happen?

Picture this: your cells are little cities. They need the right balance of minerals to function smoothly. When you don't have enough magnesium, calcium can build up inside those cells, causing dysfunction and, eventually, cell death.

This can contribute to heart disease, kidney stones, and even vision problems.

Think of magnesium as the "chill pill" for your cells, preventing this dangerous calcium buildup. It ensures that calcium is directed to the right places.

Now, this isn't an overnight thing. Pathological calcification builds slowly over time, often silently. And there are other factors at play - inflammation is a huge driver. But, magnesium deficiency is a major player we can actually do something about.

***

## How does chronic inflammation contribute to the development of anemia?

**Inflammation**

Our body bacteria (good and bad) use iron to grow. When there is inflammation, your body tends to lock up iron as a protective mechanism in order to prevent bad bacteria from growing.

## How does chronic worry negatively impact physical health?

Being in fight-or-flight mode, having elevated cortisol and adrenaline for a long period, isn’t healthy.

**Chronic stress has been known to negatively affect the body in many ways, including:**

• Shrinking your grey matter

• Shrinking your thymus gland

• Creating muscle atrophy

• Decreasing testosterone

• Running the body on sugar (even when you’re not eating sugar)

• Disrupting healthy digestion

• Reducing quality sleep

Chronic worry and stress can also lead to ulcers, inflammation, and disease. An interesting study measured 39 people’s cortisol levels before and after a 45-minute art therapy session. This study found a significant reduction of cortisol in participants. I have found that hobbies are a fantastic way to stop the fixation on stress and move your attention to something more positive.

## How does coffee affect the adrenals?

Excessive coffee consumption stimulates cortisol production, disrupting natural sleep patterns and potentially leading to adrenal fatigue. Despite its initial wakefulness benefits, over-reliance on coffee can cause chronic tiredness and increased caffeine dependency.

Moderate coffee intake to support adrenal health:

\- Limit consumption to avoid cortisol spikes.

\- Monitor caffeine intake for balanced energy levels.

\- Consider alternatives like herbal teas.

\- Prioritize sufficient sleep and stress management.

Consult with a healthcare provider for personalized guidance on optimizing caffeine intake and maintaining adrenal health.

## How does cortisol affect the body, particularly in terms of protein metabolism, and what mechanisms lead to protein breakdown and muscle loss during prolonged elevated levels?

High cortisol levels, triggered by stress, significantly impact the breakdown of proteins into amino acids. Cortisol induces a catabolic effect, breaking down muscle protein and diverting amino acids away from muscle absorption. Instead, these amino acids are processed in the liver through deamination, producing ammonia and carbon skeletons.

This process occurs as the body enters survival mode, converting proteins into sugar to meet immediate energy needs. Prolonged high cortisol levels are associated with conditions like autoimmune disease, where the immune system targets healthy tissues. Managing stress to lower cortisol levels is crucial for optimizing protein metabolism and maintaining overall health.

## How does diet influence sleep quality, and what specific foods or nutritional habits can enhance or disrupt restful sleep?

On a high-carb, low-fat diet, you’re going to be more deficient in zinc. Zinc can greatly influence parts of the brain that control sleep. If you have a sleeping problem, taking zinc before bed may help. You will also be hungry all of the time. On the other hand, if you’re on a low-carb, high-fat diet, you won’t be as deficient in zinc. You will also have decreased hunger.

If you have poor sleep (in quality and quantity), you will notice an increase in the desire to eat. Poor sleep equals more hunger. One study found that poor REM sleep increases the absorption of glucose, which spikes blood sugars, which affects insulin, which makes you hungry. Also, if you’re not sleeping, you could have high cortisol, which can also lead to an increased appetite.

***

## How does dietary fiber influence blood sugar levels, and what mechanisms underlie its role in regulating glucose metabolism?

Fiber plays a crucial role in moderating blood sugar levels by affecting the glycemic load of foods. Foods high in fiber, like carrots, have a low glycemic load because fiber slows the absorption of carbohydrates, preventing rapid spikes in blood sugar. For example, despite carrots having a relatively high glycemic index of 72, their glycemic load is very low at 3 due to their fiber content. In contrast, foods with low fiber, such as potatoes, can have a high glycemic load, with a boiled potato scoring 31. Therefore, incorporating high-fiber foods can help stabilize blood sugar levels by reducing the glycemic load, just be sure to check the glycemic index before consumption.

## How does insulin resistance turn into diabetes?

Insulin resistance is a precursor to prediabetes and [type 2 diabetes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/type-2-diabetes-is-an-fat-storing-hormone-disease-more-than-a-glucose-disease). Understanding the progression from insulin resistance to these conditions can help you take proactive steps to prevent or manage them.

#### **The Downgrading of Insulin Receptors**

In insulin resistance, the insulin receptors on your cells become less sensitive to insulin, making it harder for glucose to enter the cells. To compensate, your pancreas produces more insulin to overcome the resistance and maintain normal blood sugar levels.

However, the increased demand for insulin can gradually downgrade the insulin receptors over time, further exacerbating insulin resistance.

A study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation found that chronic hyperinsulinemia (high insulin levels) can reduce insulin receptor expression and function.

#### **The Transition from Prediabetes to Diabetes**

[Prediabetes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/most-people-have-prediabetes-and-do-not-even-know-it) is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than usual but not high enough to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes.

In prediabetes, the pancreas's compensatory mechanisms begin to fail, and insulin production may not be sufficient to maintain normal blood sugar levels.

If left unmanaged, prediabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes, where the pancreas's beta cells become exhausted and can no longer produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels effectively.

According to the American Diabetes Association, up to 70% of individuals with prediabetes will eventually develop type 2 diabetes if lifestyle changes are not implemented.

## How does magnesium intake affect sleep?

Magnesium Deficiency and its Effects:

* **Magnesium controls sodium:** Magnesium helps regulate sodium levels in the body.
* **Sodium deficiency & cortisol:** Low sodium can trigger an increase in cortisol (stress hormone), affecting sleep and overall adrenal health.
* **Salt for sleep:** Consuming a bit more salt, particularly sea salt, in the evening can help regulate cortisol, promoting better sleep.
* **Healthy salt intake:** Choose whole foods like tomatoes with a sprinkle of salt, or even just a small amount of sea salt with water, rather than processed snacks high in unhealthy sodium.

**Key takeaway:** Magnesium deficiency can indirectly affect cortisol levels by impacting sodium regulation. Adequate salt intake, especially in the evening, can help improve sleep and adrenal function. However, it's important to focus on healthy sources of salt and avoid processed foods.

***

## How does niacin help with xantomas?

Niacin can help with xanthomas by addressing underlying cholesterol issues. Here are the key points:

* **Cholesterol Management**: Niacin is one of the most effective nutrients for raising HDL (good) cholesterol levels and lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol. This can help reduce the cholesterol buildup that leads to xanthomas.
* **Liver Health**: Niacin has been shown to reduce inflammation and prevent fat buildup in the liver, which can contribute to better overall cholesterol management.
* **Dosage Recommendation**: To help lower cholesterol levels effectively, 500 milligrams of extended-release niacin two to three times daily may help.

Always consult with your medical healthcare provider before starting any new supplement or protocol to address a medical condition.

## How does prolonged high blood sugar impact nerve health?

Suffering from sustained high blood sugar can cause damage to your motor or sensory nerves. The condition is called peripheral neuropathy. You can also have problems with the autonomic nerves and even the nerves to the eye. High blood sugar can also affect the blood vessels that innervate your nerves.

Taking more B-vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast supports the myelin sheath around the nerves. In addition, switching to a low carb diet like Healthy Keto® can be helpful in negating the side-effects of high blood sugar on the nerves.

How stress affects digestion:

• It causes the development of biofilms allowing harmful bacteria to survive

• It erodes the mucosa layer, which can lead to ulcers

• It decreases transit time (causes constipation)

• It can lead to leaky gut

• It alters your microbiome and decreases the diversity and number of your microbes, which can lead to inflammation and other health concerns

## How does stress impact the function and composition of white blood cells?

**Stress, primarily regulated by cortisol, plays a critical role in immune function:**

**1. Cortisol's Role:** Cortisol suppresses white blood cells, key components of the immune system, under stress conditions.

**2. Types of Stress:** Acute stress is short-term, while chronic stress, which elevates cortisol levels persistently, can lead to cortisol resistance akin to insulin resistance.

**3. Implications of Chronic Stress:** Elevated cortisol levels can impair immune response, potentially increasing susceptibility to illness and health complications.

**4. Factors Influencing Immunity:** Chronic stress, combined with nutrient deficiencies or other factors, can compromise immune function, making individuals more vulnerable to infections and health issues.

**5. Viral Impact:** Viral infections can further impact immune function by inducing nutrient deficiencies or hindering vitamin D absorption, which may exacerbate health challenges.

## How effective are prescription sleep medications in treating sleep disorders?

If you're having trouble sleeping, it's important to pinpoint the root cause of your sleep problems. If you only address the symptom, you will have to keep dealing with the symptom because you're not fixing the root cause.

**Popular sleeping aids that do not work:**

• Drinking alcohol at night

• Over the counter allergy medication

• CBD oil

• Prescription sleep medications

## How lack of sleep affects your health?

If you’re consistently getting less than 6 hours of sleep, you increase your risk of premature death, cancer, diabetes, dementia, and more!

Sleep is the best way to clean the brain of damaged proteins, but this only occurs when you get real sleep. Sleep medication can sedate you but will not enhance your sleep quality. Alcohol significantly decreases sleep quality, causing snoring, sleep apnea, and tossing and turning. Sleep is essential for repairing and restoring the entire body, especially the immune system. Without sleep, the immune system shuts down, leaving you vulnerable to infection.

REM sleep supports parts of the brain involved in creativity, memory, and problem-solving. It improves social interaction, emotional stability, empathy, and your mood throughout the day. Most repair occurs during non-REM sleep, also known as deep or delta-wave sleep. As you age, non-REM delta wave sleep decreases significantly. Delta wave sleep is vital for fat burning, cell repair, and cell regeneration. It’s also when your body fights infections most effectively.

To improve your sleep quality, try the following restful sleep tips:

•Avoid alcohol

•Drink kombucha tea

•Exercise regularly

•Avoid eating too late

•Avoid eating too much protein

•Sleep in a cool, dark room

•Avoid too much caffeine

•Avoid excessive blue light

•Turn lights off a few hours before bed

•Get plenty of sun during the day

•Go to bed when you’re tired

•Avoid stimulating shows/movies before bed

Magnesium, vitamin D, and zinc are the most important nutrients for sleep. L. reuteri is a microbe that can help boost oxytocin and serotonin and improve sleep. Sodium is also vital for restful sleep

## How Late-Night Snacks Affect Morning Appetite?

Eating close to bedtime can disrupt your body's natural circadian rhythms and affect blood sugar levels throughout the night. When you consume food late at night, especially carbohydrate-rich snacks, your body releases insulin to process the glucose.

However, as you sleep, your body's insulin sensitivity decreases, which can lead to higher blood sugar levels.

As the night progresses, your blood sugar levels may drop, triggering a rebound effect in the morning. This can make you wake up hungrier than usual, even if you ate a substantial amount the night before.

To avoid this cycle, it's best to avoid eating large meals or snacks close to bedtime and instead focus on balanced, nutrient-dense foods throughout the day.

## How much alcohol does it take to dehydrate you?

How much alcohol it takes to dehydrate you depends on factors such as your gender, body composition, and overall health status. It’s generally believed that for every gram of alcohol consumed, the kidneys produce around ten milliliters of urine, which increases fluid loss and contributes to dehydration.

***

## How much alcohol would it take to cause early-stage liver disease?

In a study, it was found that 21 episodes of binge drinking—defined as consuming five or more drinks per occasion—showed signs of early liver disease. This amount of alcohol corresponds to slightly more than half an ounce of pure alcohol per drink, equivalent to a standard beer, glass of wine, or shot of liquor. Consistently engaging in this level of binge drinking can begin to cause early liver damage.

## How much waste do we have in our bodies?

**The Myth of 20 Pounds of Toxic Poop**

Have you ever heard that we're all walking around with pounds of toxic waste stuck in our colons? Let's bust this myth!

While some buildup is possible, especially if you're constipated, it's highly unlikely anyone has 10-20 pounds of toxic gunk lurking inside. Not only that, but our bodies have a natural waste-removal system, and harsh cleanses can actually strip away the good bacteria we need for digestion.

**What to Focus On Instead**

If you're experiencing constipation, here's what really helps:

* **Probiotics:** Boost your gut's friendly bacteria with fermented foods or a quality supplement.
* **Fiber:** Get your fill from vegetables, not processed junk.
* **Herbal Support:** Gentle herbal laxatives can be helpful short-term.
* **The Big Picture:** Long-term digestive health comes down to your diet.

**Bottom Line:** Ditch the fear-mongering about toxic waste and focus on nourishing your gut with real food and beneficial bacteria!

## How should I address vertigo?

While Vitamin D and Magnesium play significant roles in calcium regulation, there are additional things you can do. Incorporating a proper diet, along with specific lifestyle changes, might help reduce your risk. Let’s explore these further:

#### **1. Hydration: Strike a Balance**

Dehydration can often mimic the sensations of vertigo, making proper hydration crucial for managing the condition. But there's a catch – simply increasing your water intake might not always be the solution.

As odd as it sounds, just like dehydration, excessive water consumption can also disrupt your body's electrolyte balance, potentially making vertigo worse.

Instead, aim for a healthy balance and consider incorporating electrolyte-rich drinks. These drinks can be especially helpful if you're experiencing BPPV symptoms. They are especially useful during a fast.

#### **2. Reduce Caffeine and Alcohol Intake**

Both caffeine and alcohol are known diuretics. This means they can actually exacerbate dehydration by increasing fluid loss, potentially worsening vertigo. So, it’s best to enjoy these beverages in moderation.

Consider limiting their consumption, especially if you're prone to frequent vertigo episodes. Too much caffeine or alcohol can make you go to the bathroom more, which can lead to dehydration.

#### **3. Manage Stress Effectively**

We know that stress negatively affects overall health, but you may be surprised to learn that stress can also worsen vertigo symptoms. The symptoms of BPPV can be triggered by certain head positions, and stress can make these symptoms worse.

Engage in stress-reducing activities such as deep breathing exercises. Experiment with what works best for you to keep your stress in check. Managing stress can help you find relief from your vertigo.

#### **4. Address Food Sensitivities**

Sometimes, underlying food sensitivities might trigger inflammation and worsen your vertigo. Common culprits include dairy, gluten, and processed foods. If you find you have these issues, trying an elimination diet can help identify any potential triggers.

Once you pinpoint them, eliminating or reducing their consumption might bring you some relief. If you have BPPV, your healthcare provider may recommend certain dietary changes, which could include avoiding certain trigger foods.

***

## How should I time my meals for optimal blood sugar control?

In addition to choosing the right foods, timing your meals correctly can also play a significant role in managing hunger and blood sugar levels.

Aim to eat regular, balanced meals throughout the day, focusing on nutrient-dense foods that provide sustained energy.

Avoid skipping meals, which can lead to overeating later in the day and contribute to imbalances in blood sugar.

If you feel hungry between meals, reach for healthy snacks like vegetables with hummus, or a handful of nuts to tide you over until your next meal.

## How to alleviate acidosis symptoms?

While apple cider vinegar and kombucha can offer various health benefits, consuming too much acidic substance can lead to [acidosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/symptoms-of-acidosis-and-what-causes-it). Acidosis occurs when the body's pH levels become too acidic, which can cause multiple symptoms and health problems.

#### **Recognizing Symptoms**

It's essential to be aware of the signs and symptoms of acidosis, especially if you regularly consume acidic foods and drinks like apple cider vinegar and kombucha. Some common symptoms of acidosis include:

* Fatigue and weakness
* Headaches
* Rapid breathing
* Confusion
* Decreased oxygen levels
* Difficulty breathing

If you experience these symptoms after consuming apple cider vinegar or kombucha, it's important to stop consuming these drinks and seek medical attention if the symptoms persist or worsen.

To help alleviate the symptoms of acidosis, [you can try consuming alkalizing minerals](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-alkalizing-your-entire-body-is-dangerous) such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium. These minerals can help balance the body's pH levels and reduce the acidity in your system.

Alternatively, consuming a small amount of baking soda mixed with water can also help neutralize excess acid in the body.

## How to be calm?

### **Understanding the Role of Neurotransmitters in Calmness**

Ever wonder why some people seem to stay calm as a cucumber no matter what life throws at them? The secret lies in their brain chemistry - specifically, a GABA neurotransmitter.

GABA is like the brain's natural chill pill. When it's flowing freely, anxiety melts away, and a sense of tranquility takes over. But when GABA levels drop, that's when anxiety can rear its ugly head.

#### **The Science Behind GABA and Calmness**

GABA acts like the brain's chill pill, dialing down activity to keep things nice and calm. It's like the bouncer at a nightclub, deciding which thoughts and feelings get to party in your head.

Research shows that people with low GABA levels are more prone to anxiety and panic disorders. Conversely, boosting GABA can lead to feelings of relaxation and well-being.

![Different alcoholic drinks](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/different-alcohol-drinks-on-table-bar.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **The Impact of Alcohol on GABA Levels**

Ever wonder why a glass of wine can make you feel so good? Alcohol increases GABA levels in the brain, leading to that initial buzz of happiness and relaxation.

But here's the catch: when the alcohol wears off, GABA levels plummet, leaving you feeling anxious and on edge. That's why [regular heavy drinking can worsen anxiety in the long run.](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-much-alcohol-do-people-really-drink)

## How to do a DIY allergy test?

This is primarily for food allergies that you can't quite determine.

During an allergic reaction, your pulse increases. A pulse oximeter is a great tool to help you check your pulse easily, but you can also check your pulse using your wrist or carotid artery.

How to do a DIY allergy test:

1\. Check and record your pulse rate:

• In the morning, before getting out of bed

• Before eating

• 30 minutes after eating

• 30 minutes after that

• 30 minutes after that

• Before bed

2\. Record what you ate next to your pulse rate

Typically, you could have an allergy if there is a difference between the low and high pulse rates above 16 points. The pulse rate also needs to be above 84. If you react to a meal, use this test over a few days, eliminating foods one at a time to help you isolate which ingredient is causing a problem.

## How to increase oxygen levels in the body?

Deep breathing alone doesn't significantly raise blood oxygen levels. Hyperventilation from over-breathing can decrease essential carbon dioxide (CO2), impairing oxygen delivery. Your body needs CO2 for efficient oxygen release to tissues, according to the Bohr effect. Excess oxygen can be harmful, causing issues like seizures or oxidation. Techniques like slow, diaphragmatic breathing and nasal breathing can optimize oxygen uptake without the risks of hyperventilation. Consult a medical professional for chronic symptoms.

## How to lower blood pressure simply by cutting out sugar?

High blood pressure can significantly affect your health, but understanding its causes and adopting natural solutions can help you manage it effectively.

One major contributor to high blood pressure is sugar. Unlike the common belief that salt is the primary culprit, sugar often plays a more significant role. When you consume sugary foods, your body releases more insulin to manage the spike in blood sugar. This, in turn, activates your sympathetic nervous system, the "fight or flight" response, leading to elevated blood pressure.

Recognizing the symptoms of sympathetic dominance, such as a lump in the throat, cold extremities, rapid heartbeat, anxiety, insomnia, and panic attacks, is crucial for early identification of high blood pressure. By paying attention to these signs, you can take proactive measures to manage your blood pressure naturally.

Cutting out sugar from your diet is a powerful step towards lowering blood pressure. It reduces insulin spikes, prevents unnecessary stress on your cardiovascular system, and improves overall health by aiding weight management, reducing inflammation, and enhancing mental clarity.

The ketogenic diet is another effective tool for blood pressure regulation. By lowering carb intake and increasing healthy fats, it reduces insulin levels and activates the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation and lowering inflammation. Fatty fish, eggs, nuts, seeds, oils like olive oil and coconut oil, and leafy green vegetables are all excellent choices for a keto diet.

In addition to dietary changes, incorporating natural remedies like vitamin D and potassium-rich foods can further support healthy blood pressure levels. Vitamin D, obtained through sunlight, supplements, or specific foods, is crucial for maintaining balanced blood pressure. Potassium-rich foods like bananas, avocados, and dairy products can also help regulate blood pressure.

Remember, a healthy lifestyle encompassing dietary changes, exercise, stress management, and sufficient sleep is key to naturally managing high blood pressure. Consult with your doctor before making any significant changes to your diet or lifestyle, especially if you have underlying health conditions.

By understanding the impact of sugar and insulin on your body and adopting natural solutions like a keto diet, vitamin D, potassium-rich foods, and lifestyle modifications, you can take charge of your health and effectively manage your blood pressure.

## How to prevent dental plaque formation?

**Dental plaque is a biofilm of microbes. A biofilm is a calcium shell built to protect a group of microbes. Plaque is one of the primary causes of gingivitis, bad breath, and tooth decay. You can brush and floss regularly and still get plaque!**

Your mouth contains the second-largest group of microbes in your body. The majority of these microbes are known as commensal, so they’re not necessarily friendly but also not unfriendly. If you kill them, you could end up with a candida infection or oral thrush. Plaque develops when this friendly relationship turns into a pathogenic relationship. Dental plaque biofilms can develop under stress! Poor diet, sugar consumption, smoking, alcohol, and antibiotics can also contribute to dental plaque formation.

Certain chemicals can mimic antibiotics in the mouth. Ironically, chlorhexidine, the main chemical in mouthwash, mimics antibiotics in the mouth. It also increases acidity and the risk of tooth decay. Fluoride is in the majority of toothpastes and our water supply. It’s been around for 60 years, but there have never been any randomized controlled trials on fluoride in our water. Fluoride is not controlled by the FDA, CDC, EPA, or the American Dental Association—it's controlled by a private entity. It’s best to filter your water to remove fluoride.

You’ll want to get the good microbes back into your mouth to remove dental plaque. Consume probiotic-rich foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, and kefir. If you chew gum, make sure to choose xylitol gum.

## How to recognize inflammation in the eyes?

### **Recognizing Inflammation and Dryness in Eyes**

This inflammation can manifest as redness, irritation, and a gritty sensation, often accompanied by excessive dryness.

[Chronic inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-10-root-causes-of-inflammation) and [dry eyes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-causes-dry-eyes) can stem from nutrient deficiencies, particularly in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, common among individuals with poorly managed blood sugar.

Addressing these deficiencies through diet and supplementation may help alleviate symptoms and support overall eye health.

### **Lifestyle Changes to Protect Your Eyesight**

In addition to dietary modifications, specific lifestyle changes can go a long way toward safeguarding eye health and managing blood sugar levels.

Implementing these strategies can help you take control of your vision and reduce the risk of severe complications down the road.

#### **Diet Adjustments for Stable Blood Sugar**

Adopting a diet that promotes stable blood sugar levels is one of the most impactful changes you can make for your eye health and overall well-being.

This typically involves reducing your intake of simple carbohydrates and sugary foods while increasing your consumption of fiber-rich vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.

Focusing on nutrient-dense, low-glycemic foods can help keep your blood sugar levels in check and minimize the damaging effects of high glucose on your eyes.

## How to Reshape Your Face

**High Cortisol and Moon Face: Understanding the Connection**

One of the most noticeable signs of Cushing's syndrome, a condition caused by elevated cortisol levels, is a "moon face." This facial fullness is due to fat redistribution triggered by chronically high cortisol. The medication Prednisone can also cause a similar effect.

**Cortisol's Impact on Your Body**

Cortisol not only shifts fat to your face and midsection, creating a hump on your back and red cheeks, but it also weakens your muscles and thins your legs. Internally, it can raise your cholesterol and lipids, disrupt your sodium and potassium balance, elevate your blood pressure, and compromise your immune system.

**The Insulin Connection**

High cortisol indirectly contributes to facial puffiness by converting protein into glucose. This elevates insulin levels, promoting fat storage and making fat loss more difficult. Factors like carb intake, frequent eating, certain oils, nutrient deficiencies, stress, overexercising, and medications can also trigger insulin.

**5 Strategies for a Leaner Face**

1. **Reduce Meal Frequency:** Implement intermittent fasting and avoid snacking to encourage your body to burn stored fat for energy.
2. **Dietary Changes:** Cut down on carbohydrates, especially sugar and starch. Refer to my card cutout for a list of ingredients to avoid.
3. **Boost Protein Intake:** Include high-quality, grass-fed meat like beef, lamb, or goat in your diet.
4. **Manage Stress:** Engage in activities that promote relaxation and well-being, such as walking, exercise, and physical work. Reduce time spent on your phone.
5.  **Prioritize Sleep:** Ensure you're getting adequate sleep. If possible, even try to go back to sleep if you wake up early.

## How to soften dry and wrinkled skin?

Most moisturizers contain alcohol, which dries and dehydrates your skin. Your moisturizer also gets absorbed into your skin, then into your bloodstream and liver. There are many natural dry skin remedies that can help, such as vitamin E, coconut oil, and tallow, but the best remedy for dry skin is hyaluronic acid.

Many of your cells make hyaluronic acid, which is also found in your skin and joints. Hyaluronic acid holds 1000 times its weight in water and can keep your skin looking youthful. It’s intimately involved in wound repair and can repair skin after a sunburn. As we age, our hyaluronic acid decreases. There are also health conditions like progeria that cause you to lose hyaluronic acid.

Hyaluronic acid can be injected, used topically, or taken orally. When taken orally, 2.5% of hyaluronic acid is absorbed, which can be enough to replace what you lose as you age. To get rid of dry, wrinkled hands and skin, take 200 mg of hyaluronic acid daily. You can also use it topically. Look for hyaluronic acid without alcohol, wet your hands, and apply a couple of drops. Rub your hands together to apply. You can also do this to your face. Also, focus on internal health to get rid of dry skin. Try Healthy Keto® to keep your skin looking healthy.

## I have not changed my meals or routine but my niacin flush has been different every day - why?

Variability in the body’s response to niacin is common, and it often has more to do with internal or environmental factors than with the supplement itself.

Even though the meal may have been the same each day, digestion can vary. Things like gut motility, enzyme activity, stomach acid, and even the microbiome can change day to day, which can affect how quickly or strongly niacin is absorbed and processed. Stress, hydration levels, hormone fluctuations, how well someone slept, or what else is happening in the body at the time can impact how niacin affects someone. Niacin sensitivity can build over several days of use, making flushes more or less intense or over time, even if the usage stays the same.

Other factors can also impact niacin response. Taking niacin after a hot shower, during a menstrual cycle shift (if applicable), or on a day when the body is already under some sort of inflammatory load can all amplify its effects.

If the customer feels uneasy about the inconsistent response she is having, reassure her that the manufacturer uses highly controlled processes to ensure each capsule contains the intended amount. If she is still unhappy, we do have the refund policy.

## I Will Get Attacked for This...

**The Medical Industry: Lies and Misconceptions**

Modern medicine is often heavily influenced by big pharma and big food, leading to a focus on medication and overlooking the crucial role of nutrition. Let's expose some common medical industry lies:

1. **"You don’t need a gallbladder"** - False. Your gallbladder stores bile, essential for fat digestion. Removing it can lead to digestive issues.
2. **"Statins have minimal side effects"** - False. Statins can cause serious side effects like type 2 diabetes and liver damage.
3. **"Hypertension is caused by too much salt"** - Misleading. While reducing sodium can help, focus on increasing potassium intake for healthy blood pressure.
4. **"Low amounts of vitamin D will fix a deficiency"** - False. If deficient, you'll need much more than 600-800 IU daily, likely around 10,000 IU.
5. **"Red meat causes cancer"** - False. Grass-fed red meat is a nutrient-dense, healthy food, rich in protein, B vitamins, and essential minerals.
6. **"Avoid saturated fats"** - Misleading. The real danger lies in unhealthy unsaturated fats found in seed oils and processed foods.
7. **"Your weight is causing your health issues"** - False. Weight is often a _symptom_ of underlying issues like insulin resistance.
8. **"Plant-based diets are best"** - Misleading. Many plant-based products are ultra-processed and less healthy than whole foods.
9. **"Hypoglycemia is a complication of diabetes"** - False. Hypoglycemia indicates too much insulin, but doctors often advise treating it with more sugar.

**Remember:** It's important to be informed and question conventional medical advice. Focus on a balanced, whole-food diet and prioritize your overall health.

## If I have inherited fatty liver, is it advisable to take choline alongside other supplements and food?

When considering hereditary issues related to fatty liver, various metabolic problems can contribute to fat accumulation in the liver. If you suspect this is the case, you’re on the right path, as choline is essential for liver health. A deficiency in choline can lead to the development of fatty liver, so it's beneficial that you are supplementing it. Whether you take choline with meals is a minor consideration; however, taking all vitamins with meals can enhance their absorption.

In addition to choline, there are three other important strategies to consider. First, incorporate probiotic-rich foods, such as sauerkraut, into your diet. These foods support the growth of beneficial microbes, which play a role in bile salt production. Adequate bile salts are crucial for breaking down cholesterol processed by the liver, as the primary method of cholesterol elimination is through the bile ducts. Ensuring sufficient bile salt production can greatly benefit liver function.

## Impact of Lifestyle Choices on Arterial Stiffness

While Vitamin K2 is a key player in arterial health, it's not the only factor to consider. Our lifestyle choices, from the foods we eat to the medications we take, can have a big impact on the flexibility and function of our arteries.

![Food for healthy bones, vitamin D source. sardines, beans, dried figs, almonds, cottage cheese, milk](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/food-healthy-bones-calcium-sorce.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **The Double-Edged Sword of Calcium Supplements**

[Calcium supplements](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-your-calcium-supplement-killing-you) are often touted as a way to support bone health, especially for older adults. However, taking high doses of calcium without adequate Vitamin K2 can actually do more harm than good.

Excess calcium that isn't properly directed into the bones can end up in the arteries, contributing to calcification and stiffness. In fact, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3690285) have shown that taking calcium supplements without Vitamin K2 can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

If you do take calcium supplements, make sure you're balancing them with adequate K2.

#### **Medication-Induced Risks for Arterial Health**

Certain medications can also have unintended consequences for arterial health. Warfarin, a common blood thinner, works by blocking the activity of Vitamin K1 in the liver.

However, it also inhibits Vitamin K2, which can lead to increased arterial calcification over time. If you're on Warfarin or a similar medication, talk to your doctor about monitoring your Vitamin K2 levels and considering supplementation if necessary.

#### **Diet's Role in Arterial Flexibility**

Finally, the foods we eat every day can have a big impact on the health and flexibility of our arteries. A low-carb, anti-inflammatory diet can be particularly beneficial.

By reducing inflammation in the body, a low-carb diet can help prevent arterial damage and stiffening that can lead to heart disease.

It's also important to limit omega-6 fatty acids, found in vegetable oils and processed foods, as these can promote inflammation in the arteries.

In contrast, omega-3 fatty acids from fish and fish oil supplements have anti-inflammatory properties that can help keep arteries supple and healthy.

By making smart dietary choices and being mindful of the medications we take, we can create a lifestyle that supports healthy, flexible arteries well into old age.

## Importance of Specific Supplements for Autism

#### **Importance of Specific Supplements for Autism**

[N-acetylcysteine (NAC)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-does-nac-n-acetylcysteine-work), selenium, cod liver oil, vitamin D3, methylcobalamin (a form of Vitamin B12), and methylfolate are essential to ensure proper brain functioning as they help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation—both being significant contributors to autism.

They aid in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation—two factors heavily implicated in autism.

Methylene blue is another exciting piece of this puzzle—it's been found to help fix mitochondrial dysfunction often seen with autism. [Studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6078194) its potential benefits when used alongside traditional treatments.

Incorporating these supplements into an individual's diet plan can provide much-needed support toward improved well-being.

Coenzyme Q10 has also demonstrated promise, enhancing energy production at a cellular level—an important aspect considering the connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and autism.

### **Amino Acid Abnormalities in Autism**

Abnormal amino acid profiles are common among individuals with autism. This can contribute to their neurological and behavioral symptoms.

#### **The Role of Amino Acids in Neurological Function**

Amino acids are essential for our brain's normal functioning, neurotransmitters or precursors. Imbalances may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders like autism.

An exciting example is [glutamate](https://www.drberg.com/blog/msg-vs-glutamate-whats-the-difference), an excitatory neurotransmitter whose excessive levels might cause neuronal damage and inflammation linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

#### **Tackling Amino Acid Imbalance**

Correcting these imbalances through diet and supplements could potentially help manage autistic symptoms.

[Studies suggest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23515006) that foods rich in essential amino acids, such as eggs, seafood, shellfish, and organ meats, along with certain supplements, can assist the body in balancing its production of neurotransmitters.

## In what specific clinical circumstances or medical conditions should the use of bile salts be contraindicated due to potential adverse effects?

Most people need bile salts. Usually, they’re not producing enough.

**What are bile salts?** Bile salts are made by the liver and are stored in the gallbladder. When the gallbladder stores the bile salts, it concentrates them. Bile is a super-concentrated mixture to help break down fats so you can extract fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids from your food.

We make about a quart of bile every day, and 90% of the bile is recycled. There are many benefits of bile. It is also necessary to help a person detoxify chemicals. You can take purified bile salts to help digest fats and prevent gallstones.

**When not to take bile salts:**

1\. If you have diarrhea

2\. If you have a hyperthyroid condition

3\. If you have bile malabsorption

**What to do if you’re body is making too much bile, or you have too much bile:**

• Lower the amount of fats in your diet to about 60g per day (not any lower)

## Increase of Luteinizing Hormone Causes Dementia

As we age, our bodies undergo numerous changes, some of which can significantly impact our cognitive function. One such change is the increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, which has been linked to age-related cognitive decline and [dementia](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-6-warning-signs-of-dementia).

Have you heard? Researchers are now investigating how much of an impact LH may have on developing or advancing brain disorders—yes, I’m talking about ones as serious as [Alzheimer’s](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-causes-alzheimers-disease).

By examining LH's link with cognitive slip-ups, we start seeing potential paths for treating dementia that involve turning down this hormone's volume.

#### **Understanding Luteinizing Hormone and Cognitive Decline**

Luteinizing hormone, produced by the pituitary gland, plays a crucial role in regulating the reproductive system. However, as we age, LH levels tend to increase, particularly in postmenopausal women.

This surge in LH has been associated with various aspects of cognitive decline, including neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction.

Research has shown that elevated LH levels can contribute to the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, two hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.

Additionally, LH has been found to disrupt the normal functioning of synapses, the critical junctions between nerve cells that facilitate communication and memory formation.

A study published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging revealed that patients with Alzheimer's disease had significantly higher levels of LH compared to those with normal cognitive function.

This finding suggests that LH may not only be a consequence of age-related hormonal changes but also a potential contributor to the development of dementia.

#### **Lupron's Role in Dementia Symptom Reduction**

Lupron, a drug commonly used to suppress sex hormones in the treatment of conditions like prostate cancer and endometriosis, has shown promise in reducing dementia symptoms by targeting LH levels.

Taking a closer look, Lupron could be our hero in toning down the bad vibes LH sends to our brain functions by keeping its production on the low.

In a cool study by the University of Utah team, Alzheimer's patients treated with Lupron showed impressive gains in remembering stuff and thinking clearly compared to those who just got a dummy pill.

The study, published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, suggests that suppressing LH levels may be a viable therapeutic approach for managing dementia symptoms.

While more research is needed to understand the long-term effects of Lupron on cognitive health fully, these initial findings offer hope for individuals struggling with dementia and their families.

By targeting the underlying hormonal imbalances that contribute to cognitive decline, we may be able to develop more effective and targeted therapies for this devastating condition.

## Is depression a disease?

Depression is a mental state. When someone is depressed you can’t take an x-ray to see depression or a blood test to see depression. Depression is subjective. Diseases are objective and they are diagnosed based on some medical test. Depression as an emotion is real and can be caused by many things – like vitamin D deficiency, for example. Also, a lack of sleep can cause chronic fatigue, which can mimic depression.

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## Is fat absorption possible without gallbladder?

### **Fat Absorption Without a Gallbladder**

Without a gallbladder, only 50% of fats consumed are absorbed, leading to issues with cell membranes, hormone production, and deficiencies in vitamins A, D, E, and K. This can also cause inflammation.

**Importance of Fats**

Fats provide energy, support skin and hair health, brain function, hormone production, and absorption of essential vitamins.

**Hormone Production Impact**

Poor fat absorption without a gallbladder affects cholesterol levels, leading to hormonal imbalances and symptoms like mood swings and muscle weakness.

**Gastric Emptying and Digestion**

Slower gastric emptying without a gallbladder can cause nutrient absorption issues. Consuming healthy fats aids digestion.

**Tips for Healthy Fat Intake**

\- Opt for avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish.

\- Avoid trans fats and limit saturated fats.

\- Eat fiber-rich foods like vegetables and nuts for better digestion.

• C. diff

• Irritable bowel syndrome

• Autism

• MS

• Rheumatoid arthritis

• Parkinson’s disease

• Chronic fatigue syndrome

• Acne

• Depression

Fecal microbiota transplantation may also help decrease the risk of cancer and has been found to be superior to antibiotics. Fecal transplant has been around for many years. However, if we had a better relationship with our microbes, we may not even need this therapy. The more we sterilize our environment, the more we’re going to need this therapy.

## Is fever beneficial to the body?

Fever is a natural defense mechanism that helps the body fight infections by mobilizing white blood cells and speeding up recovery. Attempting to reduce a fever immediately can prolong the illness. Natural approaches to support the body during fever include taking appropriate nutrients like calcium lactate and trace minerals, and occasionally fasting. It's important to monitor fever levels and seek medical advice if they exceed specific thresholds based on age. Additionally, factors like body temperature variations, dietary influences, sleep conditions, and smoking can affect overall body temperature regulation.

## Is hypoglycemia the opposite of diabetes?

Diabetes is hyperglycemia, hyper meaning “high” and hypo meaning “low”.

Hypoglycemia is not the opposite of hyperglycemia - it is the precursor or the thing that will turn into diabetes sooner or later. The difference between the two is that hypoglycemia is the prediabetic state while in hyperglycemia there is already an insulin resistance.

What to Do for Hypoglycemia:

• Intermittent Fasting

• Reduce Carbs

## Is it advisable for a child with diabetes to follow a low-carbohydrate diet?

Children with diabetes, including type 1, can benefit from a low-carb diet to manage their condition effectively. Here’s why:

1\. **Reduced Carbohydrate Intake**: Lowering carbohydrate intake helps stabilize blood sugar levels, reducing the need for insulin and other medications.

2\. **Managing Type 1 Diabetes**: For children with type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition, a low-carb diet can mitigate fluctuations in blood sugar and improve overall glucose control.

3\. **Medical Support**: It's essential for children with diabetes to work closely with healthcare providers to tailor dietary strategies and monitor health outcomes.

By adopting a low-carb diet, children with diabetes can potentially enhance their quality of life and minimize dependence on medication, while effectively managing their condition through dietary intervention. Always consult with a healthcare professional to ensure a safe and personalized approach.

***

## Is it advisable for those with Gilbert's syndrome to follow a ketogenic diet and fasting?

When following a ketogenic diet, it's essential to prioritize nutrient-dense, high-quality ingredients, even if you have specific health conditions. Keto primarily involves reducing carbohydrate intake, but this does not inherently guarantee the use of healthy foods. Incorporating intermittent fasting alongside a well-structured ketogenic approach can enhance overall health benefits. In fact, I find it difficult to identify any scenarios where this combination would be contraindicated, even during pregnancy or lactation. However, while keto may be beneficial, intermittent fasting might not be appropriate for all individuals in those situations.

***

## Is it advisable to avoid sun exposure entirely?

There has been an association between vitamin D insufficiency and autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and at least 17 different cancers.

Vitamin D is intimately involved in over 2,000 of our genes and vital for proper immune function. It’s virtually impossible to get enough vitamin D from your diet. Only 5% to 10% of vitamin D comes from diet, and that’s only if you eat plenty of fatty fish, organ meats, and egg yolks. Around 90% to 95% percent of your vitamin D comes from the sun. Every year, there are 5,125 deaths from sun exposure and 1,684,677 deaths from lack of sun. For every death from sun exposure, there are 329 deaths from lack of sun.

The current American Dermatology Association recommendation is to stay out of the sun and use sunblock. Yet, in the early 1900s, the sun was used to treat illnesses like tuberculosis and asthma. In 1935, 1 out of 1500 people developed melanoma. By 2014, 1 in 50 people had developed melanoma, despite the fact that people are spending significantly less time outside. This shows that the sun protects you from melanoma. In fact, 75% of all melanomas are located in areas not typically exposed to the sun.

Fifty-four percent of the sun's rays are infrared light. Infrared light protects against cancer, stimulates melatonin, and also generates ATP. Vitamin D and melatonin protect the mitochondria. Both are stimulated by exposure to the sun. Aim to get a moderate amount of sun exposure to avoid burning and support your health.

***

## Is it advisable to follow a ketogenic diet with hypoglycemia?

Low blood sugar comes from high blood sugar and the spike of insulin pushing it down – hypoglycemia is high insulin.

**Don’t we need sugar to balance it?**

• The actual cause of hypoglycemia is high insulin so adding more sugar to balance, it raises more insulin. Insulin resistance is also caused by too much insulin. When you have insulin resistance, the body is making 7x the amount of insulin that you need compared to a normal person.

**How to keep insulin normal?**

• Keep sugars low.

• Don’t do frequent meals.

• Consume Magnesium + Potassium + Vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast)

***

## Is it bad to be tired during the day?

While being tired for a day or two isn’t a cause for concern, chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health implications and increases the risk of obesity, metabolic disorders, heart disease, and inflammatory conditions.

***

## Is it ok to take testosterone?

When considering testosterone supplementation, it's crucial to understand potential side effects, including worsened sleep apnea, mood swings, acne, and increased cardiovascular risk. Other effects may include reduced fertility, blood thickening, testicular atrophy, and erectile dysfunction.

Before starting testosterone supplements, identifying the underlying causes of low testosterone is essential. Factors such as aging, insulin resistance, low zinc or protein intake, a low-fat diet, statin use, high soy consumption, and deficiencies in vitamins A or D should be addressed.

Boosting testosterone naturally involves strategies like weight training, increasing zinc and vitamin D intake, prioritizing healthy fats over carbohydrates, using DHEA supplements, improving REM sleep, managing weight through a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, and ensuring adequate protein intake. These methods support natural hormone production and overall health without the potential risks associated with exogenous testosterone.

***

## Is it possible to consume an excessive amount of omega-3 fatty acids?

Achieving a balanced intake of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids is essential for optimal health. While both are necessary, modern diets often emphasize omega-6 sources, which can contribute to inflammation if consumed excessively. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in foods like fish and flaxseed, help counteract inflammation and promote overall well-being. It's crucial to reduce intake of processed omega-6 oils and prioritize natural sources of omega-3 to maintain a healthy fatty acid balance.

***

## Is it possible to contract Lyme disease without a tick bite?

Some people who receive a Lyme diagnosis may have gone years without experience any of the signs of Lyme disease. The effects of the tick bite can be latent, which means the infection can remain dormant for years in the body until something happens and it manifests. 80% of the time there’s no rash. You may not even have any symptoms at all initially.

**Lyme disease symptoms:**

• Headache

• Stiffness

• Fatigue

• Bullseye rash or tick bite rash

**Natural remedies for Lyme disease:**

• Garlic

• Olive Leaf Extract

• Colloidal Silver

• Thyme

• Oregano Oil

## Is it possible to have nutritional deficiencies from consuming low fat protein?

### **Nutritional Deficiencies from Ultra-Low Fat Protein Sources**

If you're relying on ultra-low fat protein sources like certain whey protein powders, you may be putting yourself at risk for nutritional deficiencies. These protein sources often lack important vitamins and minerals that your body needs to function properly.

#### **Insulin Response and Nutrient Absorption**

Another issue with ultra-low fat protein sources is that they can trigger an insulin response in your body. When you consume protein without enough fat, your body releases insulin to help process the protein.

Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and other health problems. Additionally, consuming protein without fat can actually hinder your body's ability to absorb certain nutrients.

Fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K require fat to be properly absorbed by your body. Without enough fat in your diet, you may not be getting the full nutritional benefits of the foods you're eating.

### **The Importance of Fatty Acids in a Proper Diet**

So, what's the solution? It's simple: make sure you're getting enough healthy fats in your diet. Fatty acids, particularly unsaturated fats found in foods like fish and nuts, are essential for overall health and well-being.

![Human brain illustration](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/human-brain-stimulation-activity-neuron-close.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **Brain Function and Nervous System Health**

Did you know that your brain is made up of about 60% fat? It's true. Fatty acids play a crucial role in brain function and nervous system health. They help to build and maintain cell membranes, support the endocrine system, and even boost immune function.

[Omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/basics-of-omega-3-fatty-acids), in particular, have been shown to have powerful brain-boosting benefits. These fatty acids are found in foods like salmon, sardines, and walnuts.

Incorporating these foods into your diet can help support healthy brain function and reduce your risk of cognitive decline.

#### **Dietary Sources of Essential Fatty Acids**

So, where can you find healthy sources of fatty acids? Here are a few examples:

* Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines
* Nuts and seeds like walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds
* Avocados
* Olive oil
* Eggs
* Full-fat dairy products like yogurt and cheese

By incorporating these foods into your diet, you can ensure that you're getting the essential fatty acids your body needs to function properly. And trust me, your brain and nervous system will thank you.

In fact, many survival manuals advise against consuming rabbit meat if it's the only food available, due to its low fat content. Instead, they recommend seeking out fattier sources of protein to ensure your body gets the nutrients it needs.

The bottom line? Don't be afraid of fat. Embrace it as an essential part of a proper, healthy diet. Your body (and your taste buds) will thank you.

***

## Is it possible to rehabilitate from stroke?

### **Innovative Stroke Rehabilitation Strategies**

In addition to traditional rehabilitation techniques, some cutting-edge strategies show promise for enhancing stroke recovery. These approaches aim to harness the brain's natural ability to adapt and rewire itself, a process known as neuroplasticity.

#### **Acute Intermittent Hypoxia for Brain Tissue Growth**

Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) is a novel therapy that involves brief, repeated exposures to low oxygen levels followed by periods of normal oxygen.

This cycle of hypoxia and reoxygenation has been shown to stimulate the release of growth factors in the brain, which can promote the formation of new neural connections.

While more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of AIH, early studies suggest that it may be a promising adjunct therapy for stroke rehabilitation, particularly when combined with traditional physical therapy exercises.

#### **Strengthening Blood Vessels with Vitamin C Complex**

Maintaining healthy blood vessels is crucial for preventing future strokes and supporting overall brain health. The whole vitamin C complex, which includes various bioflavonoids and co-factors in addition to ascorbic acid, plays a key role in blood vessel integrity.

Vitamin C helps synthesize collagen, a protein that provides structure and strength to blood vessel walls. It also acts as an antioxidant, protecting blood vessels from damage caused by free radicals.

Incorporating vitamin C-rich foods and supplements into your diet may help support healthy blood pressure levels and reduce the risk of recurrent strokes.

## Is it safe and beneficial to undergo colon cleansing?

**There are several different types of colon cleansing:**

• **Colon hydrotherapy** - This is where water goes up the rectum into the large intestine and flushes everything out. This can flush out you’re electrolytes. You may want to take electrolytes after, so you don’t become deficient. You’re also flushing out your friendly bacteria, which would need to be put back in.

**• Herbal laxatives** - Creates a purging of the material out of the colon

**• Colema** - This is a combination of an enema and a colonic. The problem is that it’s very temporary. It also flushes out your electrolytes. If you’re already deficient in electrolytes, this can cause dizziness and even affect your heart. The apple juice a person is supposed to drink while doing the colema, can also keep the blood sugars up, preventing ketosis.

Fixing your diet (doing keto) may be the best way to go. Typically, fixing the diet can fix whatever issue caused you to want to do the colon cleansing to begin with. I’m not against colon hydrotherapy as a short-term solution for constipation or other conditions. But, it should be supervised, and the electrolytes and friendly bacteria need to be put back in.

**What you can do:**

1\. Start fasting

2\. Decrease inflammation

3\. Consume phytonutrients

4\. Consume fermented vegetables

## Is juicing advisable during chemotherapy?

Well, I don't recommend juicing anything on chemo because the fasting during chemo has a really interesting effect of lessening the side effects from chemo and radiation. So it actually gives you more protection, which is pretty wild.

You actually—if you fast when you have chemo, you actually will get through a lot better. But as far as juicing in general, maybe you want to get more nutrients, then you're going to have to just do a complete greens type thing and no fruit whatsoever because that fruit is just going to feed the cancer. The greens would be good. Cruciferous green would be good, but I don't know how you feel about juicing cruciferous. It's pretty bitter. But if you did juice a daikon radish, and that's one thing I've tried once.

***

## Is menopause associated with weight gain, and what hormonal changes and lifestyle factors contribute to this phenomenon?

The ovaries make several hormones called estrogen and progesterone.

An average woman releases 400 eggs and when going through menopause, the ovaries basically stop producing eggs. Both hormones decrease but the ratio of estrogen is still much higher than progesterone leaving someone in the state of estrogen dominance.

The estrogen dominance will trigger another hormone, Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone (CRH) which is basically a hormone that communicates to the pituitary.

Cortisol is the main hormone that creates the problem.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/is-menopause-making-you-fat-drberg-on-menopause-weight-gain)

***

## Is menopause making me look masculine?

Insulin levels go up and that is what causes polycystic ovarian syndrome – by starting to convert this male hormone, androgen. During menopause, the ovaries work differently. The adrenal glands back up the ovaries and then when you get a sudden spike in cortisol (stress hormone), it can then convert into insulin. High androgen can also be a problem.

Symptoms of High Androgen Levels

• Male Pattern Baldness

• Alopecia – Patches of hair that come out in different places.

• PCOS – Acne, facial hair, hair loss, deep voice

• Infertility

• Deep Voice

• Oily Skin

• Skin Inflammation

• Increased Sex Drive

Cause of High Androgen

• Insulin Levels go up causing PCOS Reasons:

Eating a lot of sugar

The adrenal gland is backing up the ovaries.

• High Cortisol – Sudden spike in cortisol at menopause, which can then convert into insulin.

• Decreased Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) – It is the protein in the liver that helps regulate androgens, keeping them in check.

• During Menopause, the body stops releasing estrogen faster than it stops releasing androgens.

***

## Is psoriasis contagious?

No. Psoriasis is not contagious. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease. With this condition, there are certain parts of the skin that is replacing itself too fast. It may replace itself in only three days when it should be replacing itself in around 28 days. This can result in red scaly plaques on the skin.

***

## Is reducing sugar intake an effective strategy for lowering blood sugar levels?

Sugar intake increases blood pressure because it increases insulin. Insulin triggers a spike in the sympathetic nervous system, which increases stress and worsens blood pressure.

Some of the best ways to lower blood sugar include increasing your intake of vitamin D and potassium, as well as cutting sugar out of your diet.

## Is the nerve pain connected to Vitamin B6 toxicity?

Vitamin B6 is a crucial nutrient involved in numerous bodily functions, including nerve health, metabolism, and neurotransmitter synthesis. However, for some individuals, excessive or even moderate intake of Vitamin B6 can lead to a condition known as peripheral neuropathy, which manifests as nerve pain.

**Forms of Vitamin B6**

There are different forms of Vitamin B6, with the two most common in supplements being:

Pyridoxine Hydrochloride: This synthetic form of Vitamin B6 is widely used in many supplements.

Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate (P-5-P): This is the active, coenzyme form of Vitamin B6. It is considered more bioavailable, meaning the body can utilize it directly without conversion. Proponents suggest it may be less likely to cause adverse effects than pyridoxine hydrochloride, especially at higher doses, because it's already in the form the body uses.

**The Link Between Vitamin B6 and Nerve Pain**

Despite the perceived benefits of P-5-P, for some individuals, even moderate amounts of Vitamin B6, regardless of its form, may contribute to neuropathic symptoms in certain susceptible individuals. This can occur, particularly with long-term supplementation.

Individual Sensitivity: While many people can tolerate various levels of Vitamin B6 without issues, some may have a lower tolerance. In such cases, even moderate amounts might trigger or worsen nerve pain.

Symptoms: Nerve pain related to B6 toxicity often presents as tingling, numbness, burning sensations, or sharp pain, typically in the hands and feet.

**What to Do If You Experience Nerve Pain While Taking B6**

If you are experiencing nerve pain and taking supplements containing Vitamin B6, it is highly recommended to:

Consult Your Healthcare Professional: Discuss your symptoms and all the supplements you are taking with your doctor. They can help determine if there is a connection between your B6 intake and your nerve pain.

Review Supplement Labels: Pay close attention to the dosage and the form of Vitamin B6 in all your supplements, as the combined daily intake from multiple products can add up.

It's crucial to follow personalized medical guidance, as managing nerve pain and supplement use requires careful consideration of individual health circumstances.

## Is there a bacteria inside an acne cyst?

Acne isn't just about clogged pores - inflammation and bacteria also play a significant role in the severity of breakouts. Let's take a closer look at the science behind these two factors.

#### **Understanding Inflammation in Acne**

Inflammation is a common symptom of acne, causing redness, swelling, and sometimes pain. When a pore becomes clogged with sebum and dead skin cells, it creates an ideal environment for bacteria to thrive.

The body's immune system responds to this bacterial invasion by sending white blood cells to fight off the infection. This process leads to inflammation, making acne more noticeable and uncomfortable.

#### **The Bacterial Aspect of Acne**

The main culprit behind acne-related inflammation is a bacteria called Propionibacterium acnes, or P. acnes for short. This bacteria is naturally present on our skin but can multiply rapidly when trapped inside clogged pores.

As P. acnes grows, it produces propionic acid, which contributes to inflammation and can cause an unpleasant odor. The combination of inflammation and bacterial growth can lead to more severe forms of acne, such as nodules and cysts.

Understanding the science behind acne inflammation and bacterial growth is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies. By targeting these underlying causes, we can help reduce the severity and frequency of acne breakouts.

***

## Is there a connection between diet soda and elevated glucose levels?

I believe artificial sweeteners can have an indirect impact on health, particularly through their effects on the microbiome. Alterations in the microbiome can lead to insulin resistance and various issues related to blood sugar regulation. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that artificial sweeteners may contribute to these metabolic concerns.

***

## Is there a correlation between caffeine consumption and the onset of migraines?

**87% of Americans drink coffee, averaging 164mg of caffeine daily. Studies show two or more caffeinated beverages daily can trigger migraines, with 3-4 drinks increasing the risk by 1.5 times and five by 2 times.**

**Other migraine triggers include:**

\- Weather

\- Sleep disturbances

\- Stress

\- Low blood sugar

\- Loud noises

\- Bright lights

**Remedies for migraines:**

1\. Reduce or eliminate caffeine

2\. Take magnesium

3\. Follow a keto diet

4\. Increase sodium intake

5\. Massage the gallbladder

6\. Take sea kelp

***

## Is there a relationship between the consumption of red meat and the development of fatty liver disease?

There's typically no direct connection between consuming high-quality, grass-fed red meat and developing a fatty liver. In fact, red meat contains nutrients like choline that can support liver health. Fatty liver conditions are often more closely linked to excessive carbohydrate intake and other dietary factors. It's important to consider your overall diet and lifestyle when addressing fatty liver concerns.

***

## Is there a remedy that helps with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)?

ALS, or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventually death. While the exact cause remains unknown, certain strategies may help manage the disease:

1\. **Hormonal Support**: Supplement with melatonin and vitamin K2. Consider natural B vitamins and pregnenolone to support progesterone production.

2\. **Infrared Therapy**: This therapy may increase melatonin levels.

3\. **Resveratrol**: Helps decrease toxicity in the body.

These approaches, while not a cure, may provide some relief and support for individuals with ALS.

***

## Is there such thing as Vitamin D toxicity?

**Understanding Vitamin D, Magnesium, and K2**

Taking high doses of vitamin D3 can sometimes lead to symptoms that may initially be mistaken for vitamin D toxicity. However, it's often a case of magnesium or vitamin K2 deficiency.

**Magnesium's Importance**

Magnesium is essential for many bodily functions, and deficiency is common. If you are taking vitamin D without enough magnesium, you may experience symptoms like:

* Irritability
* Insomnia
* Constipation
* Fatigue
* Muscle spasms/cramps
* Calcium buildup
* Arrhythmia

**The K2 Connection**

Vitamin K2 is crucial for preventing excess calcium buildup in soft tissues. Since Vitamin D significantly increases calcium absorption, having sufficient vitamin K2 is important. Some symptoms of vitamin D toxicity may actually be signs of vitamin K depletion.

**Cautions and Considerations**

While case studies of vitamin D toxicity exist, consider that these often involve subjects lacking sufficient magnesium or K2, or using vitamin D2 instead of D3.

It's best to avoid additional calcium supplements when concerned about vitamin D toxicity, as excess calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) is a key symptom.

**Therapeutic Benefits**

Vitamin D offers therapeutic potential for many health conditions. While the Mayo Clinic recommends 600 IU, brief sun exposure provides significantly more. For conditions like autoimmunity, therapeutic doses can be beneficial – as in Dr. Coimbra's protocol involving up to 200,000 IU.

**Supplementation Strategy**

If taking vitamin D supplements, always ensure you're also getting sufficient magnesium and vitamin K2. Adequate intake of boron, zinc, and vitamin A is also important.

**Disclaimer: Please consult your doctor before making significant changes to your vitamin and mineral intake.**

## Is water the most effective beverage for hydration?

While water is one of the best drinks for hydration, drinking plain water without electrolytes can worsen dehydration. Electrolytes facilitate the absorption of fluids into the body, and drinking water with a sugar-free electrolyte powder high in potassium is an excellent strategy to support fluid balance and promote optimal hydration.

## Link Between Diet and Neurological Disorders

### **Link Between Diet and Neurological Disorders**

Diet can have a profound impact on neurological health. Diet has a noticeable impact on neurological conditions, particularly [Alzheimer's](https://www.drberg.com/blog/alzheimers-simplified) and [dementia](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-6-warning-signs-of-dementia).

#### **Alzheimer's Disease, Insulin Resistance, and Glucose Starvation**

The brain relies heavily on glucose for energy. However, when insulin resistance occurs due to poor dietary choices like consuming excessive sugar or refined carbs, it can lead to what we call 'glucose starvation' in the nerves.

This starvation scenario, where neurons are deprived of essential fuel, has been linked directly with Alzheimer's disease. So you see how your dinner plate might be affecting your cognitive health.

#### **The Connection Between Gluten and Dementia**

Gluten isn't just about avoiding bread for those wanting to lose weight. It may seem harmless, but gluten sensitivity could potentially trigger gut problems that affect more than just digestion.

Studies suggest a correlation between these gluten-triggered gut issues and an increased risk of dementia - surprising, right? While research is ongoing, reducing gluten intake seems sensible for your belly and possibly for protecting against neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia.

### **Wild-Caught Salmon: A Superfood for the Brain**

For optimal brain health, wild-caught salmon should be the food of choice. But why is it considered so beneficial?

![Wild pacific salmon](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/atlantic-salmon.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **Nutrient Profile of Wild-Caught Salmon**

The secret lies in its rich nutrient profile. Packed with Omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA and EPA, salmon provides essential building blocks for neurotransmitters - those vital messengers in our brain.

These Omega-3s improve memory, learning capacity, and mood and help lower inflammation and insulin resistance, which are detrimental to our cognitive functions.

Besides these benefits, another advantage of incorporating wild-caught salmon into your diet is its keto-friendly. This means it can provide [ketones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-a-ketone) as an alternative fuel source for the brain when you're on a [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/categories/ketogenic-diet) or[practicing intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/categories/intermittent-fasting).

Last but certainly not least is astaxanthin – this pink pigment found abundantly in wild-caught salmon is a powerful antioxidant that shields neurons from damage by free radicals.

## Magnesium Deficiency and the Correlation of Heart Issues

Evidence suggests that heart attacks are more likely to occur in the morning compared to other parts of the day.

This aligns with the concept of magnesium's role in regulating calcium balance within the body and the natural fluctuation of magnesium levels, which tend to be lowest in the morning.

Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker, helping to maintain proper calcium levels within cells and preventing excessive calcium influx. When magnesium levels are low, particularly in the morning, calcium can build up inside cells, including the smooth muscle cells lining the arteries. This excess calcium can trigger:

1. **Vasoconstriction:** Calcium causes blood vessels to constrict, reducing blood flow to the heart and increasing the risk of a heart attack.
2. **Plaque Rupture:** Calcium can also contribute to the formation and destabilization of plaque within the arteries. When plaque ruptures, it can trigger blood clot formation, leading to a blockage of blood flow to the heart and a subsequent heart attack.
3. **Arrhythmias:** Calcium plays a role in regulating heart rhythm. An imbalance in calcium levels can increase the risk of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), which can also precipitate a heart attack.

It is essential to consult your healthcare professional about the prevention or causes of heart attacks or heart-related issues.

***

## Magnesium Deficiency and the Correlation of Morning Stokes

There's evidence to suggest a correlation between magnesium deficiency and an increased risk of blood clots, which can lead to strokes, particularly in the morning.

Here's how:

* **Platelet Aggregation:** Magnesium plays a key role in inhibiting platelet aggregation, the process by which platelets clump together to form blood clots. When magnesium levels are low, platelets become more prone to aggregation, increasing the risk of clot formation.
* **Calcium Regulation:** Magnesium helps regulate calcium levels, which are crucial for blood clotting. Low magnesium levels can lead to calcium buildup in blood vessels, promoting clot formation and potentially triggering a stroke.
* **Inflammation:** Magnesium has anti-inflammatory properties. A deficiency can lead to increased inflammation, which can contribute to atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arteries) and increase the risk of clot formation and stroke.
* **Circadian Rhythm:** Magnesium levels naturally dip in the morning. This coincides with the time when strokes are more frequent. The combination of low magnesium and other factors in the morning may create a perfect storm for blood clot formation and stroke.

Discussing stroke prevention and post-stroke care with your healthcare professional is crucial for maintaining your health and well-being.

***

## Magnesium Deficiency and the Correlation of Strokes in the Morning

Research suggests a potential correlation between magnesium deficiency and an increased risk of strokes, particularly in the morning. The connection is likely multifactorial and related to magnesium's crucial roles in various bodily processes.

1. **Blood Pressure Regulation:** Magnesium helps relax blood vessels and maintain healthy blood pressure. Low magnesium levels can contribute to hypertension, a major risk factor for stroke.
2. **Calcium Regulation:** Magnesium plays a vital role in regulating calcium levels. In magnesium deficiency, calcium can build up in cells, including those lining blood vessels. This can lead to vasoconstriction, plaque formation, and blood clot formation, increasing the risk of stroke.
3. **Platelet Aggregation:** Magnesium inhibits platelet aggregation, which is the clumping together of platelets that can form blood clots. Low magnesium levels may increase platelet aggregation and contribute to clot formation, potentially leading to a stroke.
4. **Inflammation:** Magnesium has anti-inflammatory properties. A deficiency may lead to increased inflammation, which is associated with atherosclerosis and an increased risk of stroke.
5. **Circadian Rhythm:** Magnesium levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day, being lowest in the morning. This coincides with the time when strokes are most likely to occur.

Discussing stroke prevention and post-stroke care with your healthcare professional is crucial for maintaining your health and well-being.

## Niacinamide and ADD/ADHD

**Important Note:** Before discussing supplements with anyone, especially children, _always_ consult with a doctor.

**Niacinamide and ADD/ADHD: Some Background**

* Dr. William Kaufman, M.D. conducted research suggesting high doses of niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3) could potentially be helpful for individuals with ADD or ADHD.
* Vitamin B3 plays a role in creating NAD, a molecule that assists cells with energy production. This may provide more energy to nerve cells, potentially easing hyperactivity and improving focus.
* A well-functioning nervous system is important. Nutrient deficiencies can sometimes affect brain and nervous system activity. Niacinamide's effects may help reduce symptoms of ADD/ADHD.
* Because niacinamide is water-soluble, it doesn't build up in the body. Some sources suggest taking approximately 250mg, 6-8 times a day may be beneficial.

**Important Considerations**

* **Consult with a doctor:** Never change medication routines or dosages without consulting a medical professional.
* **Supplements are not a substitute for healthy eating:** While niacinamide may be helpful, a balanced diet is crucial for managing ADD/ADHD.

**Disclaimer:** This information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

## Nutritional Deficiencies Leading to Depression

### **Nutritional Deficiencies Leading to Depression**

Depression can be more than a mere emotional; it may also have physical health connections. In many cases, it's also closely linked to our physical health. One overlooked factor that can cause depression is nutritional deficiencies.

Vital nutrients like vitamin B12, iron, and [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-3-fatty-acids-reduce-insulin-resistance) are crucial in maintaining brain health and mood stability. A deficiency in any of these essential elements could trigger depressive symptoms.

Studies have found that people with low levels of vitamin B12 are twice as likely to be severely depressed compared to those with normal levels.

Remember: This doesn't mean popping pills will fix your mood overnight. The body needs a nutritious diet for optimal functioning; relying solely on supplements won't cut it.

## PFAS, or per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances

PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of man-made chemicals that have earned the nickname "forever chemicals" due to their extreme persistence in the environment and our bodies. They've been linked to a range of serious health issues, including:

* **Cancer**
* **Hormone disruption**
* **Liver damage**
* **Reproductive problems**

**Where are PFAS found?**

These chemicals are surprisingly pervasive, found in:

* **Everyday products:** Teflon cookware, food packaging, canned goods, stain-resistant fabrics, firefighting foam
* **Our environment:** Drinking water, soil, air
* **Our bodies:** Fat cells, breast milk

**How to Minimize Your Exposure and Support Detoxification**

While it's impossible to completely avoid PFAS, you can take steps to limit your exposure and support your body's natural detoxification processes:

**1. Reduce your exposure:**

* **Filter your drinking water:** Invest in a high-quality water filter certified to remove PFAS, such as those from Travel Berkey, Clearly Filtered, or Zero Water.
* **Choose PFAS-free products:** Opt for cookware, food packaging, and other products that are PFAS-free.
* **Minimize processed foods:** Processed foods often contain higher levels of PFAS.

**2. Support your body's detoxification:**

* **Boost your glutathione levels:** This crucial antioxidant helps neutralize toxins.
  * Consume foods rich in sulfur: Eggs, garlic, onions, cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts).
  * Increase your intake of glutamine: Found in red meat, glycine, and probiotics.
* **Enhance elimination:**
  * **Sweat regularly:** Through exercise or sauna use.
  * **Support autophagy:** Intermittent fasting can help promote this cellular cleaning process.
  * **Consider infrared light therapy:** May aid in detoxification.
  * **Consume spirulina and chlorella:** These algae are known for their detoxifying properties.

**3. Support your overall health:**

* **Eat a nutrient-rich diet:** Focus on whole, unprocessed foods, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein.
* **Ensure adequate intake of trace minerals:** Selenium, iodine, and copper, found in seafood and grass-fed red meat, support detoxification pathways.

While a completely toxin-free environment may be unattainable, taking proactive steps to minimize your exposure and support your body's natural defenses can help reduce the health risks associated with PFAS.

## Risks Associated with Over-Alkalization

### **Risks Associated with Over-Alkalization**

Drinking too much alkaline water can lead to a condition known as [alkalosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-alkalosis). You may experience muscle spasms and abnormal sensations when your body is overly alkaline. But it doesn't stop there.

#### **Hypochlorhydria or Achlorhydria - Consequences of Over-Alkalization**

If the stomach becomes excessively alkaline, conditions like hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria can develop. This affects protein digestion and mineral absorption negatively. Moreover, it also increases allergy risks.

In extreme cases of over-alkalization, [low potassium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/top-symptoms-of-having-low-potassium) and calcium levels in the blood might occur. You wouldn't want that.

#### **Alkalosis and Urinary Health**

The pH balance in our urine plays a crucial role in maintaining urinary health. Drinking excessive amounts of alkaline water can upset this delicate balance.

This alteration potentially heightens infection risk because an imbalance allows harmful bacteria to thrive more easily. [Studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3571898) that urinary tract infections are more common when the urine's pH is imbalanced.

## Role of Vitamins and Minerals in Autism

#### **Role of Vitamins and Minerals in Autism**

Vitamins A, E, and D, along with minerals such as [zinc](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-unexpected-amazing-benefits-of-zinc-that-you-ve-rarely-heard-about), [selenium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/12-amazing-benefits-of-selenium), and [magnesium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-benefits-of-magnesium), have pivotal roles to play in maintaining optimal brain function.

These nutrients help regulate neurotransmitters that affect mood and behavior—factors intrinsically linked to autism.

The lack thereof is frequently observed among those diagnosed with autism, leading to aggravated symptoms.

For instance, high homocysteine levels—a condition associated predominantly with vitamin B12 deficiency—can cause degenerative changes in the brain over time if left unchecked.

### **Dietary Recommendations for Individuals with Autism**

Adapting to a modified carnivore diet can help manage autism symptoms by eliminating potential allergens. It's essential, however, not to limit the food intake strictly to meat.

***

## Should people on the carnivore diet worry about ketoacidosis, elevated ammonia, or elevated urea?

Well, you're not just eating all the protein to your eating a lot of fat. Okay, so you're eating fat which actually kind of offsets that and our bodies have an incredible ability to adapt to different diets. So some people have an issue.

Some people don't but the benefits of doing that, especially if you have gut inflammation, you just pretty much you're creating a healing response to your gut because in that situation your system is compromised where you can't tolerate these fibers or legumes or or anything other than some protein and so and fat. It seems to work, but I would recommend not just doing muscle protein. I would also recommend doing like the eggs, the fish, things like that.

But it's something to test the waters and then see how you do. Do I recommend it long term? It really depends on the severity of damage. But once your gut heals, maybe you want to start introducing things like sauerkraut or fermented vegetables in smaller amounts and gradually increase it after that.

***

## Should you limit glutamine when you have cancer?

For Individuals with Cancer, Dr. Berg mentions that cancer cells can consume glutamine, suggesting that if you have cancer, you might need to consider strategies like using a glutamine inhibitor or adjusting your diet. He suggests that intermittent fasting for extended periods and reducing protein intake could be beneficial.

While glutamine is a necessary amino acid for various bodily functions, its consumption or supplementation should be carefully considered in the context of cancer. This implies that direct supplementation with glutamine might not be recommended for cancer patients without careful consideration of their overall dietary and treatment plan.

If you have cancer, **it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider before taking glutamine supplements or making significant changes to your diet, especially regarding glutamine intake**. Dr. Berg's advice highlights the complexity of glutamine's role in the body and the need for a tailored approach to nutrition and supplementation for cancer patients.

***

## The Adrenal Potassium Connection

Potassium is essential for our body's overall function, playing a vital role in quality sleep, supporting neural activities, and stabilizing blood sugar and blood pressure. A healthy adult typically requires 4,700 milligrams of potassium daily, equating to seven to ten cups of potassium-rich foods.

However, there are two exceptions where this recommended intake does not apply: Cushing's syndrome and Addison's disease.

Cushing's syndrome occurs when the adrenal gland overproduces cortisol, leading to symptoms like weight gain, fatigue, and high blood pressure. When cortisol levels eventually drop, it can result in adrenal fatigue. Adding potassium in this scenario may not be beneficial.

Addison's disease, conversely, is characterized by insufficient cortisol levels. This can cause inflammation, weight loss, pigmentation changes, and a weakened immune system. In this case, increasing potassium intake could worsen the condition. Consuming salt is a more suitable approach for individuals with Addison's.

Understanding these conditions and their relationship with potassium is crucial for maintaining optimal health. Consult your doctor for personalized advice if you have Cushing's syndrome or Addison's disease.

## The Biggest Research Study Scam

**Understanding Research Manipulation and the Importance of Critical Evaluation**

Dr. Westman, an M.D. and Master's-level statistician, highlights how data in research studies can be manipulated to present misleading information. He emphasizes the crucial distinction between absolute risk and relative risk and how this difference can be exploited.

**The Limitations of Observational Studies**

Dr. Westman points out that observational studies often cannot prove causation. He cites examples like recent headlines demonizing red meat and fasting, which frequently stem from self-reported observational studies with unreliable dietary recall data.

While observational studies cannot establish definitive cause-and-effect relationships, they serve a purpose as "hypothesis-generating studies," providing a potential starting point for more rigorous experimental research.

**Case Study: The Stanford Twin Experiment**

Dr. Westman discusses the Stanford twin experiment, a study with flaws and funding from a plant-based interest group, as a recent example of potentially misleading research.

**Nutritional Epidemiology and its Weaknesses**

Harvard University's School of Public Health conducts research based on observational studies linking dietary elements to health outcomes. Dr. Westman cautions that nutritional epidemiology often only reveals weak associations and shouldn't be treated as definitive fact.

**Dr. Westman's Approach**

Dr. Westman's clinic uses a low-carb keto diet to successfully treat numerous chronic health conditions, including diabetes, obesity, heartburn, and IBS. He focuses on both treating and educating patients, offering online courses on health topics through his Adapt Your Life Academy.

**Disclaimer: It's important to critically evaluate all health-related information and consult with qualified medical professionals when making decisions about your health.**

## The Brain's Unique Nutritional Needs

### **The Brain's Unique Nutritional Needs**

Our brains are fascinating, complex organs. Despite making up just 2% of our body weight, they use a whopping 20% of the energy we consume. But that's not all; the brain has other unique characteristics.

#### **The Brain's High Energy Consumption**

A high-performance engine needs top-quality fuel to run efficiently; your brain is no different. It consumes about one-fifth of your daily calorie intake. That's quite impressive, given its tiny size compared to the rest of your body.

This high demand for energy underscores how important it is to feed your mind with nutrient-rich foods. Doing so, you help ensure optimal performance and health for this critical organ.

#### **Brain Regeneration and Size**

Contrary to popular belief, intelligence is not determined by the size of one's brain. No correlation exists between intellect and brain size. What matters more is the complexity within our grey matter.

Fascinatingly, certain parts of our brains can regenerate, too – something once thought impossible in neuroscience. While not all areas have this capability, some regions, like the hippocampus, show promising signs of regrowth under specific conditions.

### **Harmful Foods for Brain Health**

Despite weighing only 2% of your body mass, the brain is an enormous energy consumer, devouring up to 20% of your daily caloric intake. It gobbles up to 20% of your daily calorie intake. However, not all foods are beneficial for this vital organ.

#### **The Impact of Omega-6 Fatty Acids**

[Omega-6 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-6-fats-and-inflammation) can be tricky. They're essential fats our bodies need but can't produce - so we must get them from food. Excess consumption of omega-6 fatty acids relative to [omega-3s](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-3-fatty-acids-reduce-insulin-resistance) can lead to inflammation in the brain.

Foods like vegetable oils (think soybean or corn oil) and certain nuts and seeds are high in omega-6s.

When these foods dominate our diet without adequate counterbalance from omega-rich fish or flaxseeds, it's like inviting a rowdy party-goer into your home who starts throwing furniture around—that's what inflammation does to your delicate brain cells.

#### **Sugar and Refined Carbohydrates' Role in Insulin Resistance**

Next on the 'bad guys' list are sugar and refined carbohydrates—these culprits aren't just waistline expanders but also dangerous for the mind.

[Research shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5133120) that diets high in sugar lead to [insulin resistance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/insulin-resistance-and-gluconeogenesis) over time—a condition where cells stop responding effectively to insulin signals. The result? Your neurons starve as they struggle with glucose uptake, impacting cognitive function negatively.

Frequent consumption of sodas, candy bars, pastries—even seemingly healthy foods like some breakfast cereals—can be akin to signing a 'do not disturb' sign for your brain cells. The takeaway? Be mindful of what you feed your body—it directly impacts your mind's health and function.

#### **The Link Between Sedentary Behavior and Obesity**

A detailed look at how a [lack of physical activity](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-real-benefit-of-exercise-is-not-weight-loss) can lead to weight gain and [obesity-related health issues](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-answer-to-obesity-is-obvious-if-you-look-at-the-statistics).

Inactivity can be a precursor to obesity, with numerous studies showing its effect on the rise of global rates. This link between idleness and obesity has been well-established by multiple studies.

Falling into inactive habits makes it easy for extra pounds to creep up on you, contributing more than we'd like to admit towards obesity rates worldwide.

#### **The Role of Inactivity in Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes**

Realizing the part that lack of activity plays in [insulin resistance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/insulin-resistance-and-gluconeogenesis) and the formation of [metabolic syndrome and diabetes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/metabolic-syndrome-is-really-the-hyperfat-storing-hormoneemia-syndrome).

Sedentariness doesn't just impact our waistlines but also wreaks havoc with our metabolic systems. Inactive habits contribute significantly towards insulin resistance - an unfortunate precursor to diabetes.

Metabolic syndrome, another consequence linked closely with a sedentary lifestyle, poses serious risks, as it predisposes individuals towards cardiovascular diseases and stroke, amongst other complications.

## The Importance of Reducing Inflammation for Healthy Hair

[Inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-inflammation-factor-in-common-diseases) is another factor that can contribute to hair loss, as it can damage hair follicles and disrupt the hair growth cycle. One common cause of inflammation is an imbalance of [omega-6 and omega-3](https://www.drberg.com/blog/get-your-omega-6-to-omega-3-ratios-balanced) fatty acids in the diet.

[Omega-6 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-6-fats-and-inflammation), which are found in many processed and fried foods, can promote inflammation in the body. On the other hand, [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/basics-of-omega-3-fatty-acids), which are found in fatty fish, nuts, and seeds, have anti-inflammatory properties.

To reduce inflammation and support healthy hair growth, it's important to limit your intake of omega-6-rich foods and increase your intake of omega-3s. Some good sources of omega-3s include:

* Fatty fish, such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel
* Flaxseeds and chia seeds
* Walnuts and almonds
* Avocados

By reducing inflammation in the body, you can create a more hospitable environment for healthy hair growth.

#### **Balancing Hormones Through Diet**

Hormonal imbalances can also contribute to hair loss, particularly in women. Estrogen, in particular, plays a key role in promoting healthy hair growth, while an excess of androgens like DHT can lead to hair thinning and shedding.

To help balance hormones and support healthy hair growth, it's important to include plenty of hormone-balancing foods in your diet. Some good options include:

* Cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli and cauliflower, which contain compounds that help regulate estrogen levels
* Soy products, such as tofu and tempeh, which contain phytoestrogens that can help balance hormones
* Healthy fats, such as avocados and nuts, which are important for hormone production and balance
* Adaptogenic herbs, such as ashwagandha and maca, which can help regulate the stress response and balance hormones

By incorporating these hormone-balancing foods into your diet, you can help create a more balanced hormonal environment that supports healthy hair growth.

## The Low Magnesium Epidemic

Let’s talk about the benefits of magnesium and the dangers of magnesium deficiency.

A deficiency in magnesium could put you at risk for certain health concerns, such as:

• High blood pressure

• Arrhythmias

• Tetany or twitching

• Leg or foot cramps

• Fatigue

• Diabetes

• Insulin resistance

• Depression

• Inflammation

The RDAs for magnesium are 300 to 750 mg. But some people may need much higher amounts. It’s important to consume foods high in magnesium and avoid certain things that deplete magnesium.

Foods rich in magnesium are the ones high in chlorophyll, which would be green vegetables. The top things that deplete magnesium are sugar and refined carbohydrates.

Other things that can lead to a magnesium deficiency include:

• Diarrhea

• Diuretics

• Antibiotics

• Alcohol consumption

• Age

For a magnesium supplement, you have a few different good options, including:

• Magnesium citrate

• Magnesium lactate

• Magnesium glycinate

• Magnesium aspartate

• Magnesium gluconate

Magnesium is important for the absorption of vitamin D and B vitamins. It also helps support healthy cortisol levels, which can reduce stress and help you sleep better.

## The Role of Antacids in Altering Stomach pH

### **The Role of Antacids in Altering Stomach pH**

Antacids, a common go-to for heartburn relief, can drastically change our stomach's acidity. They work by neutralizing excess acid.

Research has shown that these remedies can lead to conditions like hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria when overused. That's right - consuming too many antacids may lower your stomach acid more than necessary.

#### **Understanding Antacid Overuse**

"Too much of a good thing can be detrimental." While antacids are helpful in small doses, consistent use could create problems with protein digestion and mineral absorption due to reduced acidity.

You might think 'less acid equals less pain,' but let me surprise you: low stomach acid can increase your risk of allergies. So before reaching for an antacid next time you feel discomfort, remember moderation is key.

## The Role of Cortisol in Morning Hunger

### **The Role of Cortisol in Morning Hunger**

[Cortisol, often called the "stress hormone,"](https://www.drberg.com/blog/cortisol-extremely-simplified-by-dr-berg) plays a significant role in morning hunger while fasting and doing keto. When you wake up, cortisol levels experience a significant spike.

This spike is not just a tiny increase; it's more like a high jump athlete clearing the bar. The reason this matters is that when cortisol levels rise, it also leads to an increase in glucose (sugar) levels in the body.

This rise in blood sugar is the body's way of ensuring that you have enough energy to start your day.

However, for individuals [following a ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-start-keto-correctly) or [practicing intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/my-1-best-intermittent-fasting-tips-for-faster-weight-loss-dr-berg), this increase in blood sugar can also trigger the brain to signal hunger, even if you're not hungry.

Grasping the intricate interplay of hormones is vital for those tackling unwelcome morning cravings as they commit to their nutritional objectives.

So, the next time you feel your stomach growling before breakfast while on keto or during a fasting period, remember that cortisol may be playing a role in your morning routine.

## The Role of Liver and Adrenals in Blood Sugar Regulation

### **The Role of Liver and Adrenals in Blood Sugar Regulation**

Regarding [intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-7-important-intermittent-fasting-rules), the liver and adrenal glands play a crucial role in stabilizing blood sugar levels. These two organs work together to prevent hypoglycemic reactions, making fasting more challenging and dangerous for some people.

I've seen firsthand how important it is to maintain the health of your liver and adrenals if you want to succeed with intermittent fasting. Let's look at how these organs function and what you can do to support them.

#### **Understanding Hypoglycemia and Its Impact**

[Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-hypoglycemia-tip), can cause unpleasant symptoms like dizziness, irritability, and difficulty concentrating.

For people practicing intermittent fasting, these symptoms can be especially problematic and may even lead to fainting or seizures in severe cases.

It's essential to recognize the signs of hypoglycemia so you can take steps to prevent it from derailing your fasting efforts. Some common symptoms include:

* Shakiness or trembling
* Rapid heartbeat
* Sweating
* Confusion or difficulty focusing
* Irritability or mood swings

#### **The Interplay Between Liver Health and Blood Sugar Levels**

The liver plays a vital role in regulating blood sugar by storing excess glucose as [glycogen](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-glycogen) and releasing it into the bloodstream when levels drop too low.

However, liver damage from conditions like fatty liver disease or cirrhosis can impair this function, making it harder to maintain stable blood sugar during fasting periods.

When the liver cannot store and release glucose effectively, you may experience more frequent or severe hypoglycemic episodes. This can make intermittent fasting feel like an uphill battle, even if you do everything else right.

According to Dr. Berg, "Hypoglycemic reactions can be prevented by the adrenals and the liver." So if you're struggling with low blood sugar during fasting, it's worth taking a closer look at the health of these two key organs.

## The Role of Vitamin C and K in Preventing Eye Hemorrhaging

#### **The Role of Vitamin C and K in Preventing Eye Hemorrhaging**

Vitamins C and K play a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of the blood vessels in your eyes. When you don't get enough of these essential nutrients, the tiny capillaries in your eyes can become weak and prone to leaking or even hemorrhaging.

This can lead to some scary symptoms like sudden vision changes, floaters, or even blind spots. So if you notice any unexplained bleeding in your eyes, it could be a sign of a vitamin C or K deficiency that needs to be addressed ASAP.

#### **Addressing Light Sensitivity Through Nutrition**

Do you find yourself squinting or shielding your eyes from bright lights? [Vitamin B1, also known as thiamine](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-b1-thiamine-deficiency-signs-symptoms-and-treatment-benefits), could be the missing link. This essential nutrient plays a crucial role in managing light sensitivity issues.

When you're deficient in vitamin B1, your eyes may struggle to adapt to changes in lighting, leading to discomfort and even pain in bright environments.

#### **Nutritional Causes of Night Blindness**

If you have trouble seeing clearly in low-light conditions, a deficiency in vitamin A could be to blame. This vital nutrient is essential for producing rhodopsin, a pigment in the retina that helps you see in the dark.

Without enough vitamin A, your eyes may struggle to adjust to dim lighting, leading to night blindness and difficulty navigating in the dark. In rare cases, night blindness can also result from arsenic poisoning, which can interfere with vitamin A metabolism.

So if you're dealing with night vision issues, boosting your intake of vitamin A-rich foods like sweet potatoes, carrots, and leafy greens could make a big difference.

The bottom line? A proper diet rich in essential vitamins and minerals is crucial for maintaining healthy eyes and vision.

By being mindful of these common nutritional deficiencies and addressing them through diet and supplementation, you can give your eyes the support they need to function at their best for years to come.

## The Silent Threat of Diabetic Retinopathy

### **The Silent Threat of Diabetic Retinopathy**

Diabetic retinopathy is a severe complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness if not addressed promptly.

This condition occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the tiny blood vessels surrounding the nerve in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.

As these blood vessels weaken and leak fluid, it can cause swelling, bleeding, and scarring within the retina. Over time, this damage can progress to the point of irreversible vision loss, making diabetic retinopathy a leading cause of blindness among people with diabetes.

### **Nutritional Interventions for Eye Health**

While managing blood sugar levels is crucial for maintaining eye health, confident dietary choices and supplements can also support this.

Incorporating specific nutrients into your diet may help minimize the risk of eye complications associated with high blood sugar.

#### **The Role of Benfotiamine**

Benthotamine, a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1, has shown promise in minimizing complications from high sugar levels, particularly in retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy cases.

This unique form of thiamine can cross cell membranes more efficiently, allowing it to exert its protective effects within the eye tissues.

Studies have suggested that benthotamine supplementation may help reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy progression and support overall eye health in individuals with diabetes.

## The Truth About This "Healthy" Food

It's true that gluten can be problematic, but it's not the only protein humans struggle to digest. And while excessive gluten intake can contribute to gut inflammation, it's important to remember that **"gluten-free" doesn't automatically equal "healthy."**

Many processed gluten-free foods are packed with refined sugars, starches, and unhealthy seed oils, which can be just as damaging to your gut as gluten. These ingredients feed harmful bacteria, leading to imbalances that can trigger inflammation throughout the body and contribute to issues like fatty liver and skin problems.

Furthermore, the process of removing gluten from grains often involves harsh chemicals and results in a highly refined product that lacks essential nutrients. This can lead to overeating, nutrient deficiencies, and further gut imbalances like SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) and leaky gut.

Since gut health is closely linked to mental well-being, these issues can also manifest as mood swings, low energy, anxiety, and depression.

**Instead of relying on processed gluten-free products, prioritize whole foods like:**

* **Meat and poultry:** Excellent sources of protein and nutrients.
* **Vegetables:** Provide fiber and essential vitamins and minerals.
* **Healthy fats:** Avocado, olive oil, coconut oil, etc., support gut health.

**If you find that certain vegetables worsen your gut symptoms, you could explore approaches like the carnivore diet temporarily to help reduce inflammation and identify trigger foods.**

**Remember to always read ingredient labels carefully and choose whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible.**

## This 1 Thing Can Replace Our Entire Medical System

Fasting has gained significant attention for its potential to address the root cause of many chronic illnesses: insulin resistance. By abstaining from food for a period, you can effectively "reset" your body's metabolism and improve its sensitivity to insulin.

**How Fasting Works:**

* **Activates Survival Genes:** Fasting triggers survival mechanisms within your body, prompting it to utilize stored fat and ketones for energy instead of relying solely on glucose.
* **Ketosis:** It typically takes around 3 days of fasting to enter ketosis, a metabolic state where your body efficiently burns fat for fuel.
* **Insulin Sensitivity:** Fasting enhances your cells' responsiveness to insulin, allowing for better blood sugar regulation.
* **Cortisol Levels:** Contrary to popular belief, fasting does not elevate cortisol (stress hormone) levels.

**Types of Fasting:**

* **Water Fasting:** Consuming only water during the fasting period.
* **Dry Fasting:** Abstaining from both food and water. Dry fasting may offer additional benefits like accelerated weight loss and enhanced detoxification, but it should be approached with caution and under appropriate guidance.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Listen to Your Body:** Don't force yourself to fast longer than feels comfortable. Pay attention to your body's hunger cues.
* **Nutrient Intake:** If you experience hair loss or menstrual irregularities while fasting, it could indicate a lack of protein. Prioritize high-quality protein sources like grass-fed red meat, which provides essential amino acids, trace minerals, and B vitamins.
* **Essential Minerals:** Ensure adequate intake of sea salt, magnesium (around 400mg), and zinc (around 50mg) to support overall health during fasting.
* **Hydration and Sleep:** Stay well-hydrated (especially during water fasting) and prioritize getting enough sleep.

**Disclaimer:** While fasting can offer significant health benefits, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any fasting regimen, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications.

## This Can DESTROY Your Body

**The origins of viruses remain a subject of scientific debate. One theory suggests that they serve a crucial role in survival.**

**While our innate immune system is present from birth, our acquired immune system develops over time. Viruses play a vital role in this process, stimulating the immune system to adapt and strengthen.**

**Some viruses, such as Epstein-Barr, can interfere with the vitamin D receptor. Vitamin D is essential for overall health, supporting both bone health and immune function.**

**To ensure a robust immune system, it's crucial to maintain adequate vitamin D levels. Aim for a daily intake of at least 10,000 IU through food, sun exposure, or supplements.**

**Here are additional strategies to bolster your immune cells:**

* **Zinc**
* **Vitamin C**
* **Quality sleep**
* **Stress reduction**
* **Garlic**
* **Elderberry**
* **Intermittent fasting**
* **Magnesium**

## Underlying Cause for Autism

### **Understanding Autism and Oxidative Stress**

The real root cause of autism is often overlooked. It's not just genetics or environment, but more specifically, oxidative stress impacting neurons. This neuronal toxicity leads to inflammation, which plays a significant role in autism.

#### **Role of Oxidative Stress in Autism**

When the production of free radicals outweighs our body's ability to neutralize them with antioxidants, oxidative stress occurs. In individuals with autism, this balance tends to tip towards more oxidative stress.

This excess can damage cells, proteins, and DNA. When it comes to brain cells, or neurons as we call them, this impact becomes particularly profound due to its direct link with neurodevelopmental disorders like autism.

#### **Connection between Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Autism**

Beyond the immediate toxic effects on neurons, excessive oxidative stress also causes mitochondrial dysfunction - an issue frequently seen in those with autism.

Mitochondria are the powerhouse of our cells; they produce energy needed for cellular activities.

However, under high levels of oxidative stress, these tiny powerhouses falter, leading to impaired cell function, which may further contribute to autistic behaviors.

Research shows a clear connection here, indicating that tackling oxidative stresses could be vital in managing autism better.

### **Nutritional Deficiencies in Individuals with Autism**

People with autism often grapple with nutritional deficiencies, impacting their overall health. Among these shortcomings are reduced levels of vital antioxidants, notably glutathione.

***

## Understanding the Antioxidant Network: Oxidative Stress & Free Radicals

A free radical is an atom with an unpaired electron and could create a lot of damage inside the body, while an antioxidant is an atom that has a paired electron, is stable and balanced and it also donates one of its electrons to make the free radical stable.

Examples of Free Radicals and Oxidants:

• Iron – In some of the enriched food

• Radiation • Sugar – Large quantities of sugar destroy the body

• Chemicals / Pollution / Smoking

• Vegetable Oils – It can act as an oxidant and create free radicals

A free radical is an atom with an unpaired electron and could create a lot of damage inside the body, while an antioxidant is an atom that has a paired electron, is stable and balanced and it also donates one of its electrons to make the free radical stable.

Antioxidants:

• Vitamin E

• Vitamin C

• Zinc – Oysters, Seafood, Lobster

• Selenium – Brazil nuts

• Vitamin B1 – Leafy Greens

• Lipoic acid – it’s fat-soluble and has the ability to penetrate into the cell and protect the cells at different locations

• Uric acid – helps clean out damage from various things

***

## Understanding the pH Scale and Its Role in Our Body

The pH scale, ranging from 0 to 14, plays a vital role in our bodies. At the opposite ends of the scale, we have 0 representing extreme acidity and 14 for total alkalinity, with 7 as neutral territory. The middle ground, neutral territory, sits comfortably at seven.

#### **The Importance of pH Balance in the Body**

A healthy body isn't all about being 'neutral.' Different parts of our system thrive under varying levels of acidity or alkalinity. It's like throwing a party - everyone has their preferred music volume; too loud or soft doesn't cut it.

Blood, for instance, slightly leans towards being more alkaline, with an optimal level between 7.35 and 7.45.

#### **The Role of Acidic Environment in the Stomach**

Your stomach prefers heavy metal over classical tunes – metaphorically speaking. With a natural pH falling between 1 and 3, it’s an acidic rock star that helps break down food into digestible pieces while also fighting off harmful pathogens.

## Unmasking Hidden Ingredients in Your Food

**Unmasking Hidden Ingredients in Your Food**

Did you know food manufacturers employ sneaky tactics to conceal what's really in your food?

* **The Rounding Rule:** If an ingredient is less than 500mg per serving, it might not even be listed! This means you could be consuming unwanted additives without even knowing it.
* **Sugar Overload:** There are over 200 different names for sugar, making it difficult to track your intake.
* **Incidental Additives:** These ingredients aren't for flavor, texture, or preservation, and if they make up less than 5% of the product, they can be hidden from the ingredient list. A common culprit is maltodextrin, a carbohydrate that acts like sugar in the body and has a higher glycemic index than table sugar.
* **Hidden Dangers:** Hexane, a neurotoxin, is used to extract soy protein isolates found in many plant-based products. Despite its dangers, there's no regulation on how much hexane can remain in your food.

**DIY Ingredient Detective:**

Want to uncover hidden starches? Add a couple of drops of iodine to a glass of water. If your food turns blue or purple when mixed in, it contains hidden starch!

It's time to become a savvy label reader and take control of what you consume.

## Use Your Feet to Diagnose Liver Problems

One common sign of liver problems is red and brown spots on the lower leg. These spots are caused by poor circulation and are often seen in people who have diabetes or cirrhosis of the liver. When the liver isn't functioning properly, you may experience bruising and discoloration.

You may also notice that the lower leg is swollen and shiny and no longer grows hair. Pitting edema may accompany these symptoms. The good news about liver problems is that the liver is one of the only organs that can completely regenerate itself!

Spider veins, whether in the lower leg and foot or anywhere else on the body, signify that the liver can no longer regulate estrogen. Excess estrogen can cause a fatty liver and problems with your bile ducts, which can lead to gallstones.

Dry, cracked heels or generally dry feet are symptoms of an omega-3 deficiency.

The liver makes bile, which helps you break down and absorb fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients. If you have liver damage, it will be difficult to absorb omega-3 fatty acids. Rarely, dry, cracked heels may be related to a B3 deficiency.

Other foot-related symptoms that typically signify liver damage include:

•Itchy feet

•Fungal infections

•Inflammatory conditions like arthritis and plantar fasciitis

•Foot odor

•Hot/cold feet

•Toenail fungus

•Fungus between toes

## Viagra as a Treatment for Erectile Dysfunction

### **Viagra as a Treatment for Erectile Dysfunction**

For those experiencing ED, Viagra is an option to consider. This famous medication works by inhibiting an enzyme known as PDE5, which is crucial in helping men achieve and maintain an erection.

#### **How Viagra Works**

The science behind how Viagra functions is fascinating. Blocking the PDE5 enzyme allows blood vessels to expand more freely. More blood can then flow into the penis during sexual stimulation, improving the ability to get an erection.

Yet, while effective for many, it's worth noting that around 30% of individuals don't find relief from their ED symptoms when using this drug alone. Therefore, alternative or additional treatments might need exploration.

#### **Potential Side Effects of Viagra**

All medications come with potential side effects - even ones like Viagra. Common complaints include headaches and flushing, but there are also rare yet serious risks such as vision loss and penile gangrene - although occurrences of these severe side effects are indeed scarce.

Remembering these statistics can help manage expectations about what this treatment option can offer.

## Vitamin B6 Sensitivity and Nerve Pain

Vitamin B6 is a crucial nutrient involved in numerous bodily functions, including nerve health, metabolism, and neurotransmitter synthesis. However, for some individuals, excessive or even moderate intake of Vitamin B6 can lead to a condition known as peripheral neuropathy, which manifests as nerve pain.

**Forms of Vitamin B6**

There are different forms of Vitamin B6, with the two most common in supplements being:

Pyridoxine Hydrochloride: This synthetic form of Vitamin B6 is widely used in many supplements.

Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate (P-5-P): This is the active, coenzyme form of Vitamin B6. It is considered more bioavailable, meaning the body can utilize it directly without conversion. Proponents suggest it may be less likely to cause adverse effects than pyridoxine hydrochloride, especially at higher doses, because it's already in the form the body uses.

**The Link Between Vitamin B6 and Nerve Pain**

Despite the perceived benefits of P-5-P, for some individuals, even moderate amounts of Vitamin B6, regardless of its form, may contribute to neuropathic symptoms in certain susceptible individuals. This can occur, particularly with long-term supplementation.

Individual Sensitivity: While many people can tolerate various levels of Vitamin B6 without issues, some may have a lower tolerance. In such cases, even moderate amounts might trigger or worsen nerve pain.

Symptoms: Nerve pain related to B6 toxicity often presents as tingling, numbness, burning sensations, or sharp pain, typically in the hands and feet.

**What to Do If You Experience Nerve Pain While Taking B6**

If you are experiencing nerve pain and taking supplements containing Vitamin B6, it is highly recommended to:

Consult Your Healthcare Professional: Discuss your symptoms and all the supplements you are taking with your doctor. They can help determine if there is a connection between your B6 intake and your nerve pain.

Review Supplement Labels: Pay close attention to the dosage and the form of Vitamin B6 in all your supplements, as the combined daily intake from multiple products can add up.

It's crucial to follow personalized medical guidance, as managing nerve pain and supplement use requires careful consideration of individual health circumstances.

## What additional strategies can I implement to effectively lower my blood sugar and cholesterol levels?

When managing diabetes and insulin resistance, understanding medications like metformin is key. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity, but if blood sugars remain high despite a low-carb diet, it could indicate that insulin receptors need further support or that the liver is producing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources.

To address this, stick to your current diet and consider adding supplements like berberine, apple cider vinegar, and cinnamon, as well as herbs like ginseng and turmeric to support liver function. Healing the liver can take time, sometimes up to three years, but with consistent efforts, you can improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control.

***

## What advantages does having a diverse gut microbiome confer on overall health?

Having a diverse microbiome is crucial for overall health as it supports various bodily functions and protects against harmful bacteria. A lack of microbial diversity can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea, gut inflammation, and metabolic issues like obesity and slow metabolism. Conversely, a rich variety of microbes offers benefits like vitamin synthesis, immune support, inflammation regulation, and energy production. Maintaining microbiome diversity is essential for optimal health and well-being.

***

## What advice do you have for someone with chronic pancreatitis?

I would take TUDCA because it could be related to the little bile duct that's backing up and it's putting pressure onto the pancreatic duct that's causing some inflammation. TUDCA has some great benefits for pancreatitis but of course in this situation I'd always like to go right for the diet.

## What alternative sources of vitamin C can be included in your child's diet if she is allergic to most fruits and carrots?

Ensuring your child gets enough vitamin C can be challenging if they're allergic to most fruits and carrots. Here are some professional recommendations:

1\. **Supplements**: Consider vitamin C supplements as a reliable source.

2\. **Alternative Foods**: Include sauerkraut, which is high in vitamin C, despite its less appealing taste for kids.

3\. **Berries**: If your child is not allergic, berries are an excellent source of vitamin C.

These options should help meet your child's vitamin C needs.

***

## What approaches can I take to manage ulcers for both my child and myself, particularly in the context of acid reflux?

For managing ulcers and acid reflux, the key is dietary changes. Reduce sugar and refined flour intake, and incorporate salads with radish or broccoli sprouts, which contain sulforaphane to combat H. pylori. Healing can be supported with cabbage juice and zinc.

Avoid acidifiers like apple cider vinegar until the ulcer heals, which can take several months. If intense burning occurs, a small amount of baking soda can provide relief without worsening the condition. Proper diet and careful management are crucial for recovery.

## What are 7 bad habits that can ruin your liver?

**7 Lifestyle Factors That Damage Your Liver (And How to Fix Them)**

1. **Overuse of Over-the-Counter Medications:**
   * Surprisingly, common painkillers like Tylenol can lead to serious liver damage if taken excessively. It's crucial to be aware of the potential risks of all medications, even those available without a prescription. Don't assume they're harmless just because they're easily accessible.
   * Natural remedies like milk thistle and NAC can offer liver support.
2. **Leading a Sedentary Lifestyle:**
   * When you consume more calories than you burn, it stresses your body at the cellular level. Regular exercise not only helps you manage your weight but also boosts your immune system, improves circulation, and reduces stress – all of which benefit your liver. Make physical activity a regular part of your routine.
3. **Poor Dietary Choices:**
   * The combination of seed oils (like vegetable or canola oil) with sugar or starch is a recipe for liver damage. These ingredients are found in most processed foods and contribute to insulin resistance, a major factor in fatty liver disease, obesity, and other health issues.
4. **Prioritizing Convenience Over Nutrition:**
   * Busy schedules often lead to grabbing fast food or unhealthy snacks. These choices typically lack essential nutrients and can harm your liver. Plan your meals ahead of time so you're not tempted to make poor choices on the go.
5. **Chronic Stress:**
   * Stress disrupts sleep, affects blood sugar, and can even weaken your immune system. Vitamin B1, vitamin D, exercise, and spending time in nature can all help manage stress levels.
6. **Excessive Alcohol Consumption:**
   * Alcohol is processed directly by your liver, putting a significant strain on it. Sugary mixed drinks are particularly harmful. Limit your alcohol intake and avoid making it a daily habit.
7. **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
   * Your liver needs specific nutrients to function optimally. Include plenty of cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, kale), garlic, onion, and quality protein sources like grass-fed beef and wild-caught fish in your diet to support liver health.

Remember, your liver plays a vital role in your overall health. Taking steps to protect it can have a major positive impact on your well-being.

## What are effective ways to support bile flow?

The discomfort you’re experiencing may not originate from the gallbladder itself, but rather from the bile ducts, where thicker bile and cholesterol can create pressure and lead to pain.

To address this issue, it's important to promote bile flow. Incorporating choline into your daily regimen and taking bile salts with meals can help enhance bile production, facilitating a smoother flow through the ducts and alleviating discomfort. You may need a higher dosage than average to achieve optimal results.

During this time, it's advisable to avoid nuts, peanut butter, and dairy products. Moderate consumption of saturated fats from meat can actually stimulate bile production without worsening your condition. However, be cautious with coconut oil, vegetable oils, and fried foods high in omega-6 fatty acids, as these can exacerbate the problem. On the other hand, fatty fish like salmon should not aggravate gallbladder issues and can be beneficial.

***

## What are kidney stones, and what effective strategies and treatments can be employed to eliminate them and prevent their recurrence?

To prevent kidney stones, maintain hydration by drinking 2-3 liters of fluids daily, ideally with electrolytes like potassium citrate. Limit oxalate-rich foods such as almonds and spinach, especially on a ketogenic diet. Increase dietary calcium from sources like cheese to bind oxalates in the gut.

If fat malabsorption is an issue, additional calcium may help reduce oxalate absorption. Supplementing with citrates—like lemon juice or potassium, magnesium, and calcium—can lower oxalate levels. Balance urinary pH by increasing vegetable intake or using potassium citrate, especially for uric acid stones.

Support gut health with probiotics and ensure sufficient magnesium and vitamin D intake. Additionally, consider adding salt and vitamin K2 to help prevent calcification.

***

## What are normal blood iron levels?

Blood iron levels can be measured in a few ways, including serum iron, ferritin, and total iron binding capacity (TIBC). Consult with your medical professional to conduct testing, review results, and build a healthy blood iron plan.

*   **Serum iron**

    Normal levels for men are 50–150 mcg/dL, and for women are 35–145 mcg/dL. Low levels for men are below 76 mcg/dL, and for women are below 26 mcg/dL. High levels for men are above 198 mcg/dL, and for women are above 170 mcg/dL.
*   **Ferritin**

    Normal levels for men are 30–400 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL), and for women are 13–150 ng/mL. Low levels may indicate iron deficiency anemia, while high levels may indicate hemochromatosis.
*   **Total iron binding capacity (TIBC)**

    Normal levels for men are 171–505 mcg/dL, and for women are 149–492 mcg/dL.

Medical professionals, not Dr. Berg, have established these low, high, and normal blood iron test levels. These levels are provided for informational purposes only. Please consult your medical doctor to discuss more detailed and individualized information on blood iron levels.

## What are PFAs?

PFAS chemicals are called forever chemicals because they stay in the environment for thousands of years. They’ve been found in our fat cells and breast milk and are especially problematic in our drinking water. PFAS are linked to many health problems, including cancer, hormone problems, liver damage, and reproductive damage.

Forever chemicals are everywhere! They’re found in Teflon cookware, food packaging, and canned goods, and firefighters are exposed to them when they use their foam. PFAS were first introduced into the environment in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Companies used loopholes by conducting their own studies to classify their products as GRAS (generally recognized as safe).

To avoid the toxic side effects of PFAS, you should limit your exposure and build up your body’s tolerance to these toxic chemicals. The EWG (Environmental Working Group) evaluated 25 PFAS chemicals and found that only 3 water filters could effectively remove them from drinking water: Travel Berkey Gravity, Clearly Filtered, and Zero Water. Because the water supply exposes you to many of the forever chemicals, it’s a good idea to invest in a good water filter.

Forever chemicals build up in the body but don’t come out very easily. Here are some of the ways you can eliminate PFAS from the body and minimize their health effects:

•Sweating

•Autophagy

•Infrared light exposure

•Consuming spirulina and chlorella

Your body has detoxification enzymes that can help you eliminate poisons naturally. To help detoxify the body, consume foods with sulfur, such as eggs, garlic, and onion. Cruciferous vegetables like cabbage, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts are high in sulfur and other antioxidants that can help the detoxification process. Glutamine is a vital antioxidant that can help increase glutathione in the body. Red meat is the best source, and glycine and probiotics are also essential. It’s almost impossible to create a toxin-free environment! Trace minerals such as selenium, iodine, and copper, found in seafood and grass-fed red meat can help strengthen the biochemical pathways in your body to help eliminate forever chemicals.

## What are some great tips for when you are sick?

Viral infection symptoms will be more systemic. If you have a viral infection, you’ll notice more body aches and chills. Bacterial infection symptoms will be localized. Fevers are typically higher with a bacterial infection. A sore throat associated with a viral infection is often accompanied by a runny nose and a cough. If a sore throat is caused by a bacterial infection, you’ll feel more localized pain without a runny nose. A dry cough is associated with a viral infection, while bacterial infections are associated with a productive cough. Respiratory infection, the common cold, flu, bronchitis, and infections involving the sinuses and lungs are generally viral. Pneumonia can be both bacterial and viral. A viral infection typically lasts 1 to 2 weeks. A bacterial infection will probably last a bit longer, but this depends on your immune system. Mucus associated with a viral infection is usually clear or white and green or yellow with a bacterial infection.

The best viral infection remedies are elderberry and olive leaf extract. For bacterial infections, try garlic, oregano oil, and echinacea. The following remedies for infection work for both viral and bacterial infections:

•Take a hot bath or shower/dress warm

•Get more sleep

•Take zinc, vitamin D, and vitamin C

•Fasting

•Increase sea salt intake

•Improve emotional state

•Get more sunlight (UVB and infrared rays)

•Take cod liver oil

## What are some health tips to approach with caution?

### 7 Health Tips to Approach With Caution:

This list explores some health ideas that might require a closer look before incorporating them into your routine.

1. **Question Everything, Even From Doctors:** While doctors are experts, it's wise to be an informed patient. Ask questions, research advice, and consider seeking second opinions for complex issues.
2. **Protein Powders: Not a Magic Bullet:** Powders can be a convenient source of protein, but they lack the full spectrum of nutrients found in whole food sources like meat. Aim for a balanced diet that includes protein-rich whole foods whenever possible.
3. **Treating Symptoms vs. Root Causes:** While medication can provide relief, addressing underlying causes of health problems promotes long-term well-being. Discuss a holistic approach with your healthcare provider.
4. **Potassium for Blood Pressure, Not Just Salt Reduction:** Potassium is crucial for heart health. However, a balanced approach to electrolytes is essential. Consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance on blood pressure management.
5. **Think Quality, Not Just Fat Type:** Focus on the source of fats. Saturated fats from whole foods like red meat can be part of a healthy diet, while highly processed unsaturated fats, like seed oils, should be limited.
6. **Red Meat: Enjoy in Moderation:** Red meat offers valuable nutrients, but moderation is key.
7. **Look Beyond Nutrition Labels:** Nutrition labels provide a basic overview, but ingredient lists reveal more. Watch out for added sugars, hidden sugars in syrups and starches, and highly processed seed oils. Starches can significantly impact blood sugar, even if labeled as zero sugar.

**Remember:** It's always best to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for personalized dietary and health advice.

## What are some important signs of too high sugar consumption?

Now that we’ve covered the basics of how excess sugar can lurk in our diets, let’s explore the lesser-known consequences. Here are seven surprising signs you might be having a little too much of the sweet stuff.

Recognizing these signs early is crucial to nipping potential health problems in the bud. It can also help you make healthier food choices and decrease your intake of foods with added sugar.

#### **1. Premature Aging and Reduced Collagen**

Think of collagen as your body's natural [anti-aging remedy](https://www.drberg.com/blog/anti-aging) - it's what keeps our skin firm, elastic, and youthful-looking. However, excess sugar throws a wrench into collagen production through a process called [glycation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-are-advanced-glycation-end-products-ages).

Over time, this leads to wrinkles, sagging skin, and a general aged appearance. So if you're noticing more fine lines and wrinkles than you'd like, that daily sugary soda could be a culprit.

It's like prematurely robbing your skin of its youthful glow. Limiting added sugar in your diet can have a positive impact on your skin.

#### **2. Persistent White Tongue**

A persistently white tongue is not just aesthetically unappealing but can also be a symptom of candida overgrowth. [Candida](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-powerful-candida-and-yeast-killer) is a naturally occurring yeast in the body.

However, too much sugar disrupts the delicate balance, allowing Candida to flourish on the surface of your tongue. This leads to the stubborn white coating often associated with this imbalance.

It's not enough to brush it away. To address the root of the issue, you often need to cut back on sugar and starve those yeast overgrowths. High-sugar diets create an ideal environment for Candida to thrive, leading to this uncomfortable condition.

#### **3. Chronic Sinus Problems**

We often associate sinus problems with allergies or colds, but did you know they can also be linked to sugar? This one might come as a surprise.

As with the white tongue, an overgrowth of certain fungi can contribute to those stuffy noses and sinus headaches we often experience. And guess what those fungi thrive on? You got it—sugar.

A common culprit in [chronic sinus problems](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-food-for-chronic-sinus-issue) is the fungus Aspergillus, which just loves to feast on sugar. Addressing a chronic sinus infection could involve cutting back on those sugary treats as part of a holistic plan.

Reducing sugar intake starves these fungi and may help in managing chronic sinus issues.

#### **4. Red or Pink Gums**

Next time you brush your teeth, pay attention to what you see on the bristles. A bit of pink, especially if it's more than usual, might indicate a very, very mild version of scurvy—yes, scurvy.

This [vitamin C deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/an-interesting-cause-of-a-vitamin-c-deficiency) often appears as gum problems and is linked to excess sugar consumption. Why? Because sugar can interfere with your body's absorption and utilization of vitamin C.

#### **5. Low Testosterone**

Men, listen up. Did you know there is a surprising connection between sugar and testosterone? While the complexities of hormones and diet go beyond simple cause and effect, a diet high in sugar has been linked to dips in testosterone levels.

These imbalances often manifest as decreased libido, trouble building muscle (which we usually attribute solely to exercise and protein), and even low energy levels.

It's always essential to work with a healthcare provider to diagnose the root cause of any hormonal changes you're experiencing.

If you suspect your diet is impacting your hormone levels, consider consulting a registered dietitian or a certified nutritionist for personalized guidance.

#### **6. Susceptibility to Infections**

A robust immune system is our best defense against infections. However, excessive sugar can suppress the immune response, leaving you more vulnerable to various pathogens.

It's as if those extra sugary treats disarm your immune system, making it less effective at fighting off unwanted invaders. So if you’re finding yourself getting sick often, it might be worthwhile to examine your sugar intake as part of a bigger picture.

Eating too much sugar can weaken the body's natural defenses. By reducing your sugar intake, you can support your immune system's ability to fight off infections and stay healthy.

#### **7. High Adrenaline Levels**

When we think of high adrenaline, we often think of stress, right? But it turns out excess sugar consumption can be a hidden stressor for our bodies. Here's how: High sugar intake disrupts your cells' ability to create energy efficiently.

To compensate, your body churns out adrenaline—not necessarily due to mental stress, but because of this cellular energy chaos.

This explains why fatigue can sometimes be accompanied by nervous, jittery energy, often accompanied by restlessness. And it doesn't stop there—chronic adrenaline surges disrupt sleep, potentially leading to conditions like restless leg syndrome.

The effects extend to digestion (think sugar-induced heartburn.) and may even contribute to clotting risks in certain individuals.

## What are some important warning body signs that shouldn't be ignored?

These are important warning signs that shouldn't be ignored. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment if you experience any of these symptoms.

**5 Warning Signs You Shouldn't Normalize**

1. **Chronic Fatigue:** While fatigue can be a normal part of life, persistent exhaustion that doesn't improve with rest can be a sign of underlying issues like anemia, vitamin deficiencies, infections, or even chronic diseases.
2. **Sudden Weight Loss:** Unexplained weight loss, especially if it's significant, can be a red flag for conditions like hyperthyroidism, diabetes, or even cancer.
3. **Persistent Weakness:** Feeling weak all the time can be due to nutrient deficiencies (iron, magnesium, potassium, vitamin E), but it can also be linked to more serious conditions like anemia or neurological problems.
4. **Chronic Diarrhea:** Occasional diarrhea is common, but if it lasts for weeks or is accompanied by other symptoms like blood in the stool, it's important to investigate potential causes like infections, food intolerances, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
5. **Persistent Stomach Pain:** Stomach pain that doesn't go away or gets worse could be a sign of gallstones, ulcers, pancreatitis, or even certain types of cancer.

**Important Note:**

* **Self-Diagnosis and Treatment:** While the suggestions you've provided (probiotics, intermittent fasting, etc.) may be helpful for some individuals, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plans.
* **Rare but Serious Conditions:** While many of these symptoms can be linked to less serious conditions, it's important to remember that they can also be signs of rare but potentially life-threatening illnesses.
* **Seek Professional Help:** If you're experiencing any of these warning signs, don't hesitate to reach out to a doctor or other healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation.

By paying attention to your body and seeking help when needed, you can ensure that any underlying health issues are addressed promptly and effectively.

## What are some optimal food choices for brain and eye health?

### **Navigating Dietary Choices for Optimal Brain and Eye Health**

Navigating dietary choices for optimal brain and eye health involves selecting foods rich in nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins crucial for cognitive function and vision.

By incorporating fatty fish, leafy greens, berries, and nuts into your diet, you can provide essential nutrients that support brain function and protect against age-related eye conditions.

Understanding the impact of dietary choices on brain and eye health can empower individuals to make informed decisions to maintain cognitive sharpness and visual acuity throughout life.

![Selection of ketogenic foods](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/healthy-low-carbs-products-ketogenic-diet-0.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **Incorporating Fish into Your Diet**

Diving into a diet abundant with these underwater wonders, like salmon and mackerel, elevates your brainpower and enhances your eyesight.

Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for constructing brain cell barriers and play a pivotal part in maintaining the health of your retina.

But it's not just about throwing fish onto your plate willy-nilly. Variety is key. Mixing up your fish intake ensures you get both DHA and EPA types of omega-3s - essential for mental clarity and reducing inflammation that could cloud your vision.

To ensure you're hitting the mark with omega-3 intake without breaking the bank or getting bored at dinner time, consider adding flaxseeds or walnuts to salads for an extra crunch of these vital nutrients when seafood isn't on the menu.

#### **Vegan Alternatives for Omega-3s**

If you’re navigating a plant-based path but still want those juicy cognitive benefits from omega-3s, don’t fret. Microalgae supplements are a fantastic vegan source of DHA. They directly provide what fish consume to become rich in these fatty acids.

For everyday eating, chia seeds, hemp seeds, and walnuts offer ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), which our bodies can convert into EPA and DHA, albeit less efficiently than consuming them directly from animal sources or algae-based supplements.

So sprinkle some on oatmeal or blend them into smoothies.

## What are some overlooked signs of an iodine deficiency?

Overlooked signs of an iodine deficiency:

1\. Estrogen dominance. Iodine helps regulate estrogen and helps prevent estrogen dominance. It also supports detoxification.

2\. High cortisol levels. Iodine helps normalize cortisol levels.

3\. A hypothyroid condition. Hypothyroidism can cause the cholesterol in your body to be elevated but unusable for making vitamin D, cell membranes, and bile.

4\. Side effects when consuming soy products. Iodine helps buffer the estrogen effects of consuming soy products.

5\. Hashimoto's. You still need iodine if you have Hashimoto's, but not excess iodine. You may also need selenium, zinc, vitamin D, and myo-inositol.

***

## What are some quick methods to reduce acid reflux?

Heartburn is not a problem resulting from too much acid—it's a valve problem. Keeping the pH of the stomach between 1 and 3 keeps the valve shut.

**How to get rid of heartburn naturally:**

**1. The most important nutrient to eliminate and prevent heartburn is vitamin B1 (thiamine).** Your stomach can not produce acid when you’re deficient in vitamin B1. A diet high in carbs depletes B1. Low B1 deprives the autonomic nervous system, which controls the valves of the stomach. Look for a natural source of vitamin B1 to get rid of heartburn.

**2. Potassium and zinc are very important for your stomach acid.** Try a good electrolyte powder and trace mineral supplement to increase your intake of these important minerals. Also, make sure you’re getting plenty of sea salt.

**3. Increase your stomach acid.** This triggers the valve at the top of the stomach to close. Apple cider vinegar and betaine hydrochloride can help acidify the stomach.

It’s important to note that if apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride causes burning, you may have gastritis or an ulcer. In this situation, you need to heal the stomach before taking apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride.

***

## What are some really serious symptoms of potassium deficiency?

Extremely low potassium levels can be life-threatening. Seek immediate medical help if you experience the following potassium deficiency symptoms:

* Severe Muscle Weakness: This goes beyond general weakness and involves your muscles not functioning as they should. Severe muscle weakness might even lead to paralysis.
* Difficulty Breathing: This occurs because low potassium can disrupt the muscle function involved in breathing.
* Confusion and Mood Changes: This symptom is more than just brain fog. With severe potassium deficiency, you can become confused or disoriented and have sudden, extreme mood shifts.

***

## What are some red flags for shoulder pain?

Severe swelling or bruising around the joint, deformity in appearance, inability to move the arm without intense discomfort, and fever accompanying localized tenderness or warmth at touch are red flags indicating underlying severe issues related to shoulder pain.

Seek immediate medical attention if any red flag symptoms arise.

***

## What are some severe potassium deficiency symptoms?

As a potassium deficiency progresses, you may encounter more severe potassium deficiency symptoms, some of which are serious:

* Heart Palpitations: Feeling like your heart is skipping a beat or fluttering? These sensations, known as heart palpitations, can be unnerving. While not all palpitations indicate a severe problem, persistent palpitations could result from low potassium. Because potassium plays such a vital role in regulating your heartbeat, an imbalance can throw your heart rhythm off. You might feel an occasional flutter or more noticeable, rapid beats in your chest. If this is something you've experienced, getting your potassium levels checked is crucial.
* Numbness and Tingling: That “pins-and-needles” sensation you get when your foot falls asleep is tingling (also known as paresthesia), often occurring alongside numbness, where you lose sensation. Potassium plays a role in nerve health and function. When your potassium drops too low, nerve signals may misfire. This often presents as numbness or that odd tingling feeling, mainly in your extremities, like hands and feet.
* Muscle Weakness: Low potassium can manifest as muscle weakness beyond the occasional cramp. If you’re having a hard time going about your daily activities due to weakness, look into low potassium as a possible cause. Weakness in severe cases of hypokalemia can lead to paralysis, this is when it becomes a medical emergency.

## What are some things that slow down mitochondrial function?

While exploring ways to support healthy mitochondrial function is intriguing, being mindful of factors that can negatively impact these processes is equally important.

Just as certain lifestyle choices can promote mitochondrial uncoupling, others can hinder it. Understanding these factors can empower you to make informed choices that support your overall health and well-being.

Some factors that can affect mitochondrial function include:

* Consuming too many calories.
* Excessive snacking between meals.
* Leading a sedentary lifestyle.
* Exposure to environmental toxins like heavy metals.
* Certain medications.

***

## What are some things to avoid if you are over 50?

1\. Don’t take health advice from inexperienced people.

2\. Don’t be too quick to accept a diagnosis.

3\. Avoid solutions that create more problems.

4\. Avoid excessive stress.

The most important nutrient for people over 50 is vitamin D. Vitamin D influences 10% of your genes. You need at least 10,000 IU of vitamin D or more to produce a therapeutic effect. Doctors worldwide are using vitamin D3 for many health concerns, including autoimmune diseases, eye problems, and fibroids.

Magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D work together in a synergistic relationship. Magnesium is vital for heart health and energy. Avoid calcium and iron supplements as you age. It’s very difficult to rid the body of excess iron.

You don’t need to avoid salt! Opt for sea salt and make sure you’re getting plenty of potassium. Sodium deficiency can cause increased cortisol levels, which can interfere with sleep.

Cholesterol is an essential building block of sex hormones, so you must get enough after menopause. Cholesterol is essential for our brain, bile salts, and other hormones. Butter, eggs, dairy, and shellfish are the best dietary sources of cholesterol.

Focus on removing carbs from the diet and prioritizing quality protein. Grass-fed beef or lamb is the best source of protein.

Frequent eating stimulates insulin, which is the root cause of many chronic illnesses, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and a fatty liver.

Autoimmune diseases are related to low vitamin D and the microbes, viruses, and other pathogens that downgrade the vitamin D receptor. After severe stress or shock, your immune system becomes suppressed, leaving you vulnerable to autoimmune disease.

* **Hormonal Imbalance:** Affecting testosterone levels and thyroid function, leading to low energy and mood swings.
* **Cognitive Decline:** Memory problems, learning difficulties, and trouble with spatial location.

**Diet Matters: The Zinc Absorption Puzzle**

The food you eat plays a major role in how well your body absorbs zinc. Refined carbohydrates and foods high in phytic acid (like whole grains and legumes) can hinder zinc absorption.

**Unmasking the Deficiency**

* **The Zinc Taste Test:** Swish a zinc sulfate solution and note the taste. A metallic taste suggests adequate zinc levels, while a watery taste may indicate a deficiency.
* **Blood Tests & Hair Analysis:** Provide accurate data on your zinc levels, guiding dietary adjustments or supplementation.

**Zinc's Impact on Hormones & Cognition**

* **Hormonal Health:** Zinc supports thyroid function and healthy testosterone levels. Deficiency can lead to fatigue, low mood, and other hormonal imbalances.
* **Cognitive Function:** Zinc is crucial for memory, learning, and spatial location. Low levels can impair cognitive abilities.

**Conclusion: Listen to Your Body**

Zinc deficiency symptoms can be subtle, but they're a call to action. Pay attention to these signs and take steps to ensure you're getting enough zinc through diet or supplementation.

Remember, understanding your body's needs is the first step towards optimal health. Don't let zinc deficiency be the silent saboteur of your well-being.

## What are some ways to manage Sjögren’s syndrome?

While I don't have personal experience with it, autoimmune diseases can have a significant impact on the body, affecting connective tissues, skin, joints, and digestion. One potential approach to managing symptoms is to maintain high levels of vitamin D, which may help reduce inflammation and support remission of certain symptoms.

Additionally, adopting a healthy lifestyle through a ketogenic diet combined with intermittent fasting may promote overall health. Intermittent fasting, in particular, has been shown to support immune system healing.

**Please consult with a healthcare professional before making any changes to your health regimen or addressing medical conditions.**

***

## What are steroid drugs and what are side effects of them?

Corticosteroids are primarily used to manage inflammation, but they suppress the immune system, increasing susceptibility to infections like pneumonia and potentially activating latent tuberculosis. Long-term use can lead to adrenal suppression and withdrawal symptoms such as osteoporosis, ulcers, and diabetes. Alternatives include curcumin, boswellia, green tea, vitamin D, and fasting. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously and for short durations.

## What are the 6 health conditions that could potentially benefit from addressing nutrient needs?

### Could Nutritional Deficiencies Be Hiding Behind Your Health Concerns?

Modern medicine sometimes encounters health issues with unknown causes, categorized as "idiopathic." However, research suggests some of these might be linked to nutritional deficiencies.

Here are 6 health conditions that could potentially benefit from addressing nutrient needs:

**1. Fatigue, Mood Problems (Neurasthenia):** This could be linked to Vitamin B3 deficiency. Consider consulting a healthcare professional about including Niacin in your regimen, but avoid self-dosing at high levels. Remember, a balanced diet is also crucial.

**2. Tourette Syndrome:** Studies suggest a possible link between Tourette's and Vitamin B3 deficiency. Niacinamide, another form of B3, might offer some relief. However, discuss proper dosage with a healthcare professional.

**3. Persecutory Delusions:** Feelings of persecution, apathy, and disorganized thoughts might be signs of Vitamin B12 deficiency. Consulting a doctor and addressing B12 levels could be helpful.

## What are the best and worst belly bloating foods?

Feeling bloated after a meal is a common issue, but understanding the culprits behind belly bloat can be a game-changer. Dietary choices and underlying conditions like IBS or lactose intolerance play significant roles in this discomfort.

**Understanding Belly Bloat**

Bloating is that uncomfortable feeling of fullness and tightness in your stomach. It can be caused by various factors, including:

* **Diet:** Certain foods, especially those high in FODMAPs, can trigger gas production and bloating. Eating too quickly or consuming large meals can also strain your digestive tract.
* **Medical Conditions:** IBS and lactose intolerance are common conditions often associated with bloating.
* **Other Factors:** Swallowing air, carbonated drinks, and hormonal changes can also contribute.

**Foods That Fight Bloating**

* **High-Fiber Foods:** Soluble fiber, found in avocado, sunflower seeds, and hazelnuts, can reduce bloating by absorbing water and softening stool. However, excessive insoluble fiber from vegetables and whole grains can lead to gas and bloating. Gradually increase your intake and choose low-gas options like berries, citrus fruits, and cooked vegetables.
* **Ginger Tea:** Ginger has anti-inflammatory and carminative properties, soothing the digestive tract and relieving gas.

**Worst Foods for Bloating**

* **Cruciferous Vegetables:** Broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts are nutritious but can cause bloating due to their high FODMAP content. Cooking them thoroughly and consuming them in moderation can help.
* **Dairy Products:** For those with lactose intolerance, dairy can trigger bloating. Try lactose-free alternatives or fermented dairy products with probiotics.
* **High-Sodium Foods:** Excess salt leads to water retention, exacerbating bloating. Choose whole, unprocessed foods, low-sodium options, and increase potassium intake.

**Lifestyle Changes**

* **Mindful Eating:** Eating slowly and chewing thoroughly reduces air swallowing and aids digestion.
* **Hydration:** Drinking plenty of water prevents constipation and bloating.

**Bloating and Fasting**

Bloating during fasting can occur due to changes in eating patterns. Stay hydrated, consume fiber-rich foods during non-fasting periods, avoid carbonated drinks, and consider natural remedies like peppermint or ginger tea.

**Conclusion**

Understanding the best and worst foods for belly bloating empowers you to make informed dietary choices and enjoy your meals without discomfort. Remember, a balanced diet, mindful eating, and proper hydration are key to a happier gut.

## What are the best dietary tips for managing hypothyroidism?

Tip #1 - Don’t go on a low-calorie diet. Why? Because you also lower your nutrition, which starves the metabolism. Low-calorie diets end up slowing down your thyroid even more. You need plenty of nutrients, so don’t starve your body.

Tip #2 - Avoid pre-packaged foods. Most pre-packaged foods contain something called soy protein isolates. What are these? They are a very low-quality protein that interferes with the thyroid and the liver. These are not good for the body. Avoid soy at all costs

Tip #3 - Avoid stimulates. This includes things like phentermine and diet pills. When the thyroid is stimulated, you run the risk of burning it out down the road. Stay away from stimulates like these.

## What are the causes for low CO2?

This condition can be caused by several factors, including:

#### **Causes of Low CO2 (Hypocapnia)**

* **Asthma**: Respiratory conditions like asthma can lead to rapid breathing or hyperventilation, reducing CO2 levels.
* **COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)**: COPD can cause difficulty in breathing, leading to altered CO2 levels.
* **Panic Attacks and Anxiety**: These conditions often cause hyperventilation, which lowers CO2 levels.
* **Lung Infections**: Infections in the lungs can affect breathing patterns, potentially leading to reduced CO2.
* **Anemia**: This condition can impact oxygen and CO2 transport within the body.

#### **Remedies for Low CO2**

The context does not provide specific remedies targeted directly at increasing CO2 levels. However, addressing the underlying causes of hyperventilation and improving overall respiratory health can help manage CO2 levels. Some general approaches might include:

* **Managing Respiratory Conditions**: Proper treatment and management of conditions like asthma and COPD can help stabilize breathing patterns and CO2 levels.

## What are the causes for panic attacks?

Panic attacks can be intensely frightening experiences, but understanding their causes and knowing effective remedies can be incredibly helpful.

#### **Causes of Panic Attacks**

1. **High Amounts of Stress**: Excessive stress can overburden your adrenal glands (stress-regulating glands), leading to malfunction and an inability to properly manage stress levels.
2. **Respiratory Alkalosis**: This condition occurs when the pH of your lungs becomes too alkaline, often due to hyperventilation. It shares many symptoms with panic attacks, such as hyperventilation, dizziness, and palpitations.
3. **Oxygen Toxicity**: During a panic attack, flooding your lungs with too much oxygen and not enough CO2 can lead to oxygen toxicity, exacerbating the feeling of suffocation and air hunger.

#### **Remedies for Panic Attacks**

1. **Control Your Breathing**:
   * Breathe through your nose.
   * Slow down your breathing by counting 3-4 seconds in and 3-4 seconds out.
   * Use diaphragmatic breathing rather than chest breathing.
   * Take soft and gentle breaths.
   * Going outside for more space can also help.
2. **Immediate Stress Reduction**:
   * Slow your breathing (4 seconds in, 4 seconds out).
   * Take vitamin B1 (found in nutritional yeast or benfotiamine supplements).
   * Improve sleep quality and take naps if needed.
   * Engage in long walks outside for 45 to 60 minutes a day.
   * Avoid stress-inducing stimuli, like watching the news.
3. **Diet and Lifestyle**:
   * Following the Healthy Keto® diet may help manage underlying conditions that contribute to panic attacks.
   * Consuming adaptogens can help your body manage stress better.
   * Practice acupressure techniques for immediate relief.
4. **Support Your Nervous System**:
   * Supporting your nervous system through dietary changes, supplements like vitamin B1, and lifestyle adjustments can help manage stress and reduce the frequency of panic attacks.

Remember, while these remedies can be effective for managing panic attacks, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment, especially if panic attacks are frequent or severe. They can help identify any underlying conditions and recommend a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your needs.

## What are the causes for Respiratory Alkalosis?

Alkalosis is a condition where your body becomes too alkaline, meaning the pH level of your body fluids is higher than normal. The human body requires a specific balance of acidity and alkalinity to function correctly, with different parts of the body having different optimal pH levels. Alkalosis disrupts this balance, leading to various symptoms and health issues. It's important to maintain a balanced pH for overall health, avoiding being too acidic or too alkaline.

The remedies for alkalosis include:

* **Apple Cider Vinegar**: Consuming 1 to 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar stirred into about a cup of water is recommended. This can help balance the body's pH by introducing more acidity into the digestive system, which may counteract the effects of alkalosis.
* **Betaine Hydrochloride**: This is another remedy suggested for alkalosis. It can help increase stomach acid, which may be beneficial for those experiencing alkalosis symptoms due to low stomach acid levels.

It's important to note that while these remedies can be helpful, they are not substitutes for professional medical advice. If you're experiencing symptoms of alkalosis, such as muscle weakness, cramping, or breathing problems, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider to address the underlying causes and receive appropriate treatment.

## What are the causes for sunspots?

#### Sunspots, also known as liver spots or solar lentigines, are flat brown spots caused by excessive sun exposure and an overproduction of melanin, the skin pigment.

**Melanin, produced by melanocytes in the epidermis, increases due to UV radiation, leading to tanning and eventually sunspots.**

**Contributing Factors:**

\- Sun Exposure: Primary cause

\- Hormonal Changes: Pregnancy, menopause

\- Medications: Birth control pills, antibiotics

\- Genetics: Family history

**Most Affected: Sunspots are common in people over 40 with fair skin and a sun-exposed history.**

**Prevention Tips: Protect your skin from the sun regardless of age or skin type to prevent sunspots.**

***

## What are the causes of low Vitamin D levels? (new video)

(new video)

Low vitamin D levels are caused by people staying indoors, location, skin color, and other lifestyle and genetic factors. Low vitamin D symptoms include:

•Low back pain

•High blood pressure

•Depression

•Anxiety

•Inflammation

•Poor immune function

Sunblock blocks the absorption of vitamin D. In 1980, society became sun phobic in an attempt to prevent skin cancer, which has continued to increase despite less sun exposure. You need 10,000 IUs of vitamin D daily, especially for immune function. This amount of vitamin D is the same amount you’d get from 20 minutes of sun exposure in the summertime.

When you get a blood test for vitamin D, they’re not checking for the active form and are not accounting for vitamin D resistance. Many things block the vitamin D receptor and contribute to vitamin D resistance, including genetics, plastics, forever chemicals, age, weight, inflammation, pregnancy, and lactation. Vitamin D3 won’t work without magnesium. As you increase your vitamin D intake, the demand for magnesium increases. Vitamin K2 and zinc are also vital when increasing your vitamin D dosage. Vitamin D has potent anti-cancer and anti-tumor benefits at therapeutic doses. It can also combat inflammation and autoimmune conditions. Dr. Coimbra of Brazil has seen positive effects with high doses of vitamin D in people with autoimmune conditions.

## What are the common causes of abdominal distention?

Abdominal distention, characterized by swelling and discomfort after meals, can stem from various causes:

1\. **Microbial Fermentation:**

\- Overload of carbohydrates and excessive fiber can lead to microbial fermentation in the gut, causing gas and distention.

\- Remedies include reducing carb and fiber intake, using apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride before meals, and consuming ginger, fennel seeds (avoid during pregnancy), anise, peppermint, and cooked vegetables. Probiotics can also help.

2\. **Food Sensitivities and Intolerances:**

\- Intolerance to FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols), lectins, or specific allergens can cause inflammation and digestive issues.

\- Remedies involve avoiding high-FODMAP foods like certain fruits, dairy products, wheat, and legumes, and substituting with low-FODMAP alternatives. Avoiding high-lectin foods and allergens while maintaining a food diary can help identify triggers.

3\. **Gluten and Grains Consumption:**

\- Gluten and grains are common culprits for bloating. Avoiding these foods can alleviate symptoms.

\- Remedies include eliminating gluten-containing foods such as bread, pasta, and cereals, as well as other grain products, sugars, and alcoholic beverages.

Other Considerations:

\- Addressing factors like lack of bile, liver health, excessive fiber intake, large meal consumption, SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth), frequent eating, intolerance to lectins, fat intolerance, adrenal fatigue, and protein overload may also help manage abdominal distention.

Natural Remedies:

\- Acupressure techniques can potentially aid in alleviating symptoms of abdominal distention.

Consulting a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment plan is recommended for persistent abdominal discomfort.

***

## What are the common causes of bedwetting?

Bedwetting is a common problem in children, but many adults can have accidents or near accidents too. Getting up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night has the same root cause as bedwetting.

**Cause #1: High insulin**

Bedwetting is caused by high levels of insulin. And that results from a high-carb diet. Carbohydrates spike your insulin levels. Over time, this causes the cells to develop a resistance to insulin--which then causes higher insulin production by your body. As you know, Insulin lowers blood sugar. When the blood sugar goes down your body lets go of excess liquid. This can happen at night.

**Remedies:**

* Avoid sugar and refined carbs
* Avoid grains
* Do an intermittent fasting plan
* Do a Healthy Keto® diet
* Consume vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)
* Consume vegetable shakes

**Get plenty of insulin-regulating nutrients**

• chromium • potassium • B vitamins (nutritional yeast)

***

## What are the common causes of bloodshot eyes?

Interestingly, vitamin B2 deficiency can cause your eyes to look bloodshot.

Low vitamin B2 can cause other symptoms related to your eyes, including itchy eyes, watery eyes, and light sensitivity.

**Aside from your eyes, a vitamin B2 deficiency may also cause symptoms such as:**

• Cracked or chapped lips

• Cracked corners of your mouth

• Oily nose

• Red tongue

• Migraines

The question is, what causes low vitamin B2? A vitamin B2 deficiency isn’t usually caused by not consuming enough foods with vitamin B2. Instead, it’s typically caused by a malabsorption situation.

There are two primary causes of poor vitamin B2 absorption. Inflammation in the digestive system can cause absorption issues, and refined carbohydrates can cause poor absorption. Bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, pancakes, waffles, biscuits, and all other refined carbohydrate products are very destructive to your digestive system. Avoid these at all costs.

## What are the common causes of constipation, and how do factors such as diet, hydration, and medical conditions contribute to this issue?

Constipation can stem from various factors, each with specific remedies:

1\. **Poor Gut Microbiome:**

\- **Cause:** Imbalance in gut bacteria affects food digestion.

\- **Remedies:** Take probiotics and eat fermented foods like sauerkraut and yogurt.

2\. **Low Bile:**

\- **Cause:** Insufficient bile leads to poor fat digestion.

\- **Remedies:** Use purified bile salts, increase saturated fats, and try gallbladder acupressure.

3\. **Low Stomach Acidity:**

\- **Cause:** Reduced stomach acid impairs nutrient breakdown.

\- **Remedies:** Take apple cider vinegar and betaine hydrochloride before meals.

4\. **Excess Fiber:**

\- **Cause:** Too much fiber, especially from grains, can worsen constipation.

\- **Remedies:** Avoid extra fiber, focus on improving digestion, slowly reintroduce fiber, and consider adding fruits.

Other factors include high fat intake, nut consumption, lactose intolerance, sensitivity to casein or certain vegetables, imbalance from excessive water intake without electrolytes, and stress.

These targeted remedies aim to enhance digestive function and gut health. Consult with healthcare providers for personalized advice.

## What are the common causes of cracked or chapped lips?

What’s causing cracked lips or chapped lips is really a vitamin B2 and B3 deficiency. What can create a deficiency in vitamin B2 and vitamin B3? Consuming too many refined-flour products is a really big cause. I’m talking about foods like bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, and waffles.

**More potential causes behind cracked lips:**

• Zinc deficiency

• Vitamin A deficiency

• Alcohol

**The best food that’s rich in vitamin B2 and vitamin B3:**

• Organic pasture-raised egg yolks

***

## What are the common causes of crusty eyes?

Crusty eyes can indicate a vitamin A deficiency, particularly when there's dryness and thickened mucus. Vitamin A, found in animal products like eggs, beef liver, and cod liver oil, is crucial for eye health. Factors such as low iron, insufficient pancreatic enzymes, gallbladder issues, alcohol consumption, IBS, inflammation, and antibiotic use can hinder vitamin A absorption. Increasing intake from animal sources, like cod liver oil, can help alleviate crusty eyes, while addressing absorption issues is key for effective treatment.

## What are the common causes of low back pain, and how do factors such as muscle strain, injuries, and underlying medical conditions contribute to this issue?

If you are experiencing pain in the low area of the back, this can have several causes. Most of them are connected to your kidneys. However, the pain could be due to muscle imbalances or a pinched nerve.

**Cause #1: Kidney stones / oxalates crystallization**

Oxalates are substances that are located in some foods. Oxalates can create crystallization in the kidneys, resulting in low back pain and kidney stones. The best way to resolve such a problem would be to avoid foods high in oxalates.

Additionally, consuming more water and other fluids should help with kidney stones in general. You also should take electrolytes to stay hydrated. Too acidic a body pH or consuming salts in high amounts can contribute to stone formation, specifically uric acid stones.

**Remedies:**

*   As a general remedy, do an acupressure technique to relieve pain in the back:

    • watch this video • draw an imaginary line through your body from an epicenter of your back • massage the area in the front that is directly opposite from the epicenter of your back pain • the best way to know if you have hit the right spot: it will be tender
*   Avoid these foods:

    • spinach • almonds • chocolate • rhubarb
* Consume lemon water to block oxalates
* Drink more water
* Consume electrolytes
* Consume moderate amounts of salts (reduce if needed)
* If you have too acid a pH (acidosis), alkalize the body:
  * consume more vegetables
  * take potassium citrate

**Cause #3: Too much protein**

Consuming too much protein can affect your kidneys and can result in low back pain. Additionally, if you consume a lot of protein, a large part of it will not be digested and will turn into waste products in your body. Protein should be consumed in moderate amounts daily (3 to 6 oz per meal).

**Remedies:**

* Consume moderate amounts of protein (3 to 6 oz per meal)

**Cause #4: Muscle imbalances and pinched nerves**

Muscle imbalance can cause low back pain. For example if you are developing only one set of leg muscles (like in cycling) without paying attention to additional or opposite ones, you can create additional pressure on your muscles and as result on your back. Another example would be sitting and crossing your legs only on one side and not doing the same with the other leg to balance it out; this can result in a pinched nerve on one side.

**Remedies:**

* If you find yourself repeatedly crossing your legs from one side, alternate and cross from the other side
* If you are cycling, work out your glutes and the back side of your legs to balance the muscles out
* You can also do yoga to strengthen your weak muscles
* As a general remedy, do an acupressure technique to relieve pain in the back:
  * watch this video
  * draw an imaginary line through your body from an epicenter of your back
  * massage the area in the front that is directly opposite from the epicenter of your back pain
  * the best way to know if you hit the right spot: it will be tender

**Other causes:**

*   Acidosis

## What are the common causes of low blood pressure?

Low blood pressure can cause a lot of problems if the causes are unknown and only symptoms are treated. Let’s take a look at common reasons behind it.

**Cause #1: Postural hypotension (POTS)**

Postural hypotension (or POTS) is a condition where, if you stand up too fast, you feel dizzy. This condition is linked to the low blood sugar that can result when your stress-regulating glands (adrenals) are worn out or you are deficient in vitamin B1. When weak adrenals or deficiency in B1 bring about low blood sugar, it can show up as POTS.

**Remedies:**

* Take vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

* Avoid refined carbs and sugar (they deplete you of vitamin B1)
* Avoid alcohol (depletes you of vitamin B1)
* Support your adrenals by doing the following:
  * improve sleep (take naps if needed)
  * regularly exercise (don’t overtrain)
  * take long walks outside (at least 45 minutes)
  * take magnesium
* take potassium
* You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support
* You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Cause #2: Dehydration**

If you don’t consume enough fluid in your diet this can result in dehydration of your body and, as a result, low blood pressure. Dehydration can be caused by vomiting, diarrhea, diuretics, not drinking enough fluid or lack of electrolytes (especially salt and potassium). Salt is very important for your body to be able to retain fluid, so make sure you are not deficient in it.

**Remedies:**

* Drink more fluids
* Take electrolytes high in potassium
* Consume more Himalayan sea salt
* Consume more vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)
* Avoid diuretics

**Other causes:**

* Medication (diuretics, antidepressants, HBP meds)
* Addison’s disease
* Iron deficiency (anemia)
* B12 and folate deficiency
* After eating your blood pressure can go low

## What methods can be used to accurately measure blood sugar levels, and how do these approaches vary in terms of convenience and reliability?

Learn about how to quickly determine what's going on with your blood sugars based on how the body feels after you eat.

1\. If you eat and you are NOT satisfied, chances are you have insulin resistance because the cells can't absorb fuel.

2\. If you eat and you feel sleepy, it could be that your blood sugars are too high.

3\. And if you eat and feel better, it could be a low blood sugar situation (hypoglycemia).

## What methods can help relieve symptoms of premenopause and postmenopause?

With menopause, you experience a drop in both hormones. But because of the ratio of the two, it appears as though you have estrogen dominance when, in fact, you have an estrogen deficiency along with a progesterone deficiency. It’s just that progesterone has dropped more than estrogen.

Some of the symptoms you may experience before and after menopause are hot flashes, breast atrophy, vaginal dryness, and no periods (amenorrhea). Of course, menopause is that life stage during which your periods naturally stop, usually around age 52. But your periods may stop before that because of a drop in estrogen.

Regardless of what age you are, if you have any of these symptoms it could be because of a drop in estrogen or progesterone

## What natural remedies can effectively alleviate heartburn, acid reflux, or GERD without the use of medication?

**We're told that the cause of acid reflux, heartburn, and GERD is too much acid. But, I've found that rather than the overproduction of acid, these issues are typically caused by an underproduction of acid.** Two main conditions cause low stomach acid: hypochlorhydria and achlorhydria. Symptoms of both these conditions include acid reflux, heartburn, and GERD. Hydrochloric acid is there to help you break down food, absorb minerals and vitamins, and protect against pathogens. A deficiency in hydrochloric acid can lead to a myriad of health concerns. One of the side effects of antacids or other acid-suppressing medications is a loss of stomach acid. This can temporarily cause someone to feel better but can lead to other health issues.

**Top causes of low stomach acid:**

• Hypothyroidism

• Poor diet

• A suppressed immune system

• Antacids

• Low-salt diets

• Potassium deficiency

• Zinc deficiency

• Iodine deficiency

• Eating too frequently

**Betaine hydrochloride** is the best natural remedy for heartburn, GERD, and acid reflux. However, you shouldn't take it if you have an ulcer, and don't take betaine hydrochloride on an empty stomach. Consuming the Healthy Keto diet® and doing intermittent fasting may also be beneficial.

## What natural things can I do for gastroparesis?

Gastroparesis, characterized by delayed stomach emptying, often arises from vagus nerve dysfunction linked to thiamine (B1) deficiency. Thiamine is essential for acetylcholine production, vital for vagus nerve function. Insufficient B1 can lead to symptoms like gastroparesis, constipation, and low stomach acid, impairing digestion.

Addressing B1 deficiency through natural supplementation and dietary adjustments is crucial. Avoiding refined carbs, sugars, and excessive caffeine supports B1 levels. Monitoring B1 supplementation effects can potentially alleviate gastroparesis symptoms and enhance digestive health. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.

***

## What nutrient deficiencies are commonly linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?

The most common nutrient deficiencies in individuals with IBD are:

1\. **Iron Deficiency**: Due to blood loss and decreased absorption from inflammation, 80% of those with IBD are iron deficient, which can lead to anemia. The best sources of iron are animal products (especially beef and organ meats) and spirulina. It's advisable to get iron from food rather than supplements to avoid excess buildup.

2\. **Vitamin D Deficiency**: Affecting 70% of those with IBD, inflammation hinders dietary vitamin D absorption. Factors like age, weight, skin tone, and location also impact levels. Vitamin D is crucial for calcium absorption, repairing the small intestine lining, and reducing inflammation. A daily intake of 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3 is recommended.

3\. **Vitamin B12 and B9 (Folate) Deficiency**: These vitamins come from diet and gut microbes. Gut inflammation can reduce beneficial bacteria, limiting B vitamin production and absorption. Deficiencies can cause fatigue, anemia, and other health issues.

4\. **Vitamin K1 and K2 Deficiency**: An unhealthy gut can decrease levels of these vitamins, which are produced by gut microbes. Vitamin K1 aids blood clotting, while K2 supports bone strength and prevents calcium buildup in arteries and joints. Replenishing these nutrients is essential for those with IBD.

***

## What nutrient deficiency cause migraines?

**Migraines, Mitochondria, and the Power of Vitamin B2**

Migraines can be a debilitating experience – intense pain, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea... it's no wonder they're linked to the #1 vitamin deficiency. While genetics can play a role, don't despair. Understanding the factors that trigger your migraines can help you manage them effectively.

The key may lie in your mitochondria, the powerhouses of your cells. Research suggests a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and migraines. This is where riboflavin (vitamin B2) comes in! It supports healthy mitochondrial function and the production of glutathione, a crucial antioxidant that protects your brain cells.

**Why B2 Matters**

B2 deficiency is a common factor in migraines. It plays a crucial role in oxygen utilization within your mitochondria – vital for energy production. If you have a genetic tendency towards mitochondrial issues, you might need even more B2.

**B2 for Migraine Relief**

* **Prevention:** Try 400mg of vitamin B2 daily.
* **Acute Attack:** If a migraine strikes, try 100mg of B2 every hour until symptoms subside (up to a maximum of 400mg daily).

**Beyond B2**

Sodium deficiency can also trigger migraines, so consider increasing your sea salt intake. If B2 alone doesn't provide full relief, natural remedies like ginger or turmeric may offer additional support.

**Important:** Always consult your doctor before starting any new supplements or making significant dietary changes, especially if you experience migraines.

***

## What nutritional deficiencies are associated with sleep apnea?

This is a condition that affects sleep. The root cause of this is high glucose which then depletes vitamin B1 and could affect the function of your breathing.

Vitamin B1 is essential in maintaining the normal function of the brain stem especially for your breathing centers which connect to the nerve called the phrenic nerve. This nerve controls the entire diaphragm, its motor control, and movement.

I recommend taking B1 (100-500mg) with a natural blend of Bs from nutritional yeast (unfortified).

**Symptoms of Low Vitamin B1:**

• Lactic Acidosis – pH becomes slightly more acidic.

• Dyspnea – It is the difficulty of breathing that is related to something called Beri Beri.

• SIDS – (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) which is related to a severe B1 deficiency in an infant.

***

## What nutritional deficiencies are most commonly associated with constipation, and how do they affect digestive health?

The #1 nutritional deficiency behind constipation: a vitamin B1 deficiency. A severe vitamin B1 deficiency is called beriberi.

Constipation is essentially a problem with peristalsis—it’s not working properly, and you’re not pumping waste through the body. The autonomic nervous system is intimately involved with the gut. When you don’t have enough vitamin B1 (thiamine), a lot of things can go wrong with the autonomic nervous system—which then affects the gut.

## What part of day is the magnesium lowest and highest?

Magnesium levels do exhibit a natural ebb and flow throughout the day, following a circadian rhythm.

Typically, magnesium levels tend to be highest in the evening and lowest in the morning. This pattern is thought to be linked to the body's natural sleep-wake cycle and hormonal fluctuations.

* **Evening:** Magnesium levels rise in the evening, promoting relaxation and preparing the body for sleep. Magnesium helps to calm the nervous system and regulate the production of melatonin, a sleep-inducing hormone.
* **Morning:** Magnesium levels are lowest in the morning, coinciding with the body's natural wake-up process. This decrease in magnesium may contribute to increased alertness and energy levels.

Understanding this natural fluctuation in magnesium levels can be helpful in managing magnesium intake and optimizing its benefits. For example, taking a magnesium supplement in the evening may help promote relaxation, while taking it in the morning might not be as effective.

It's important to note that individual variations in magnesium levels can occur, and factors like stress, exercise, and diet can also influence magnesium levels.

## What physiological changes occur in a man's body when estrogen levels are elevated?

Consequences of high estrogen in men:

1\. It can increase the risk of stroke • Excess estrogen can increase the risk of blood clots that can lead to stroke.

2\. Too much estrogen can be dangerous to the cardiovascular system • Estrogen (estradiol) is typically at higher levels when someone has a heart attack, and when men have atherosclerosis.

3\. Estrogen dominance can cause an enlarged prostate • Estrogen is an anabolic hormone. It grows things.

What to do:

• DIM

• Stinging nettle root

• Cruciferous vegetables

• Reduce insulin (do healthy keto and intermittent fasting)

***

## What physiological changes occur in the body following gallbladder removal surgery?

Your liver makes bile, which acts as a detergent to break down fats. Your gallbladder stores and concentrates bile, so it’s ready for use when you consume dietary fat. You need your bile to be concentrated to fully break down fat. When it isn’t concentrated, you can have incomplete fat digestion. In turn, your risk of developing a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids is increased.

Without a gallbladder, you may experience symptoms such as:

• Floating stool

• Bloating

• Right shoulder pain

• Incomplete toxin removal

• Constipation

• Incomplete conversation of thyroid hormone T4 to T3

• Vitamin deficiencies

## What potential adverse effects are associated with the use of Synthroid?

Treating hypothyroidism with medications like Synthroid can create a dependency on the drug.

A potential side effect of taking Synthroid long-term, especially if a person is post-menopausal, is an increased risk of bone loss. The thyroid produces more than one hormone, but people are typically treated with only one hormone. So, what about the other hormones? You need these hormones—they are important for a healthy body. A lack of these essential hormones can lead to various symptoms, like bone loss.

\*\*You may want to talk to your doctor about Armour® Thyroid. Armour Thyroid comes from a natural source and contains more than one thyroid hormone. \*\*

## What potential underlying conditions or factors could lead to dizziness specifically when turning my head to the right?

Dizziness when turning your head to the right could be due to several factors:

1\. **Ear or Sinus Issues**: Check for mucus in the Eustachian tubes, ear infections, or sinusitis, which can affect balance.

2\. **Neck Alignment Issues**: Consider seeing a chiropractor to assess for malalignment or arthritis in the neck.

3\. **Hydration and Blood Pressure**: Increasing sea salt intake might help regulate blood pressure, potentially alleviating dizziness.

These steps can help identify and address the underlying causes of your symptoms.

***

## What preventive measures can be taken to reduce the risk of blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks?

Your body constantly forms and dissolves clots as part of its healthy functioning. A clot, called a thrombus, is made up of 96 percent protein and only 4 percent cholesterol. Yet many people believe cholesterol is the culprit, even though consuming cholesterol won’t form clots leading to strokes and heart attacks.

A clot can become a problem when it doesn’t dissolve. Your body produces a compound that blocks your ability to dissolve clots — and when this compound is elevated so too is your risk of a thrombus. Keeping the compound low is key, and can be done by avoiding four specific triggers that elevate it: glucose, insulin, cortisol, and estrogen.

Estrogen as a trigger explains why women who take hormone replacement therapy are at increased risk of a stroke. If you believe saturated fats are the culprit in blood clots, you can be assured they’re not. Saturated fats aren’t one of the triggers of the compound that prevents your body from dissolving clots as it normally would. This is good news if you’re already on or considering going on the keto diet, and were hesitant because you wondered if eating saturated fats might increase your risk of heart attacks and strokes. It won’t.

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## What should be avoided if I have an enlarged prostate?

If you have an enlarged prostate, it's advisable to avoid certain foods:

1\. **Dairy:** Dairy products like cheese, milk, yogurt, and butter can exacerbate prostate swelling due to their hormone content, particularly growth hormones.

2\. **Vegetable Oils:** Omega-6 rich oils found in salad dressings, such as corn, canola, and soy oil, are inflammatory. Opt for olive oil instead.

3\. **Sugar and Grains:** Sugars and foods that convert to sugar, like grains, bread, and pasta, should be limited to manage inflammation and hormone balance.

4\. **Soy:** Avoid soy products due to their estrogenic properties, which can impact prostate health negatively.

These dietary adjustments can help alleviate symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate.

## What should I do for severe gut problems?

I believe the best diet includes both meat and plants. But I understand that some people can't consume vegetables. Let's talk about how to support healthy digestion if you can't consume vegetable fiber. The worst type of diet is the one that many humans consume. This diet is technically an omnivore diet, but the plant products are really mostly grain products, and grain products can lead to gut damage. Gut damage can make it difficult to consume foods with fiber, like salad.

One of the benefits of fiber is that it feeds your microbiome. Your microbiome has many different functions, including fermentation. During the fermentation process, the microbes make small-chain fatty acids, vitamins, other acids, and secondary compounds that support the immune system.

But, if your microbes don't have access to fiber, they can consume other things. If someone is on a carnivore diet, their microbes can adapt to digest protein. You're not going to kill your microbes if you avoid plants. The important thing is to avoid grains. While some people have difficulty consuming any vegetables, other people may be able to consume fermented vegetables. This includes foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, and pickled vegetables.

Fermented vegetables have additional microbes that may help support your gut. They also have prebiotics, vitamins, and other health benefits.

**Tips to support your microbiome and overall gut health:**

1\. If you consume animal products, consume grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

2\. If you are vegan or vegetarian, don't consume grains.

3\. If you have severe gut problems, try a carnivore diet with grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

4\. If you have less severe problems with digestion, try consuming fermented vegetables along with grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

5\. If you don't have any digestive problems, try consuming a combination of plants (not grains) and grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

## What side effects can iodine deficiency have on IQ and cognitive function, particularly in populations at risk?

Iodine is a trace mineral that supports brain function, thyroid function, child growth, and also helps regulate estrogen. Iodine deficiency can cause a goiter and also affects cognitive function.

Intellectual disability, also known as mental retardation, is characterized by decreased motor skills, slower learning, decreased ability to solve problems, and an IQ of less than 70.

About half of the time, the condition is considered idiopathic. This means that the cause is unknown, but this isn’t true! The most likely cause is an iodine deficiency. If you’re pregnant, consume sea kelp to prevent an iodine deficiency. Sea kelp is the best source of iodine. If you choose an iodine supplement, make sure it’s a food-based source of iodine.

## What signs or changes in the eyes can indicate fluctuations in blood sugar levels, and how do these ocular symptoms relate to overall metabolic health?

Here are seven things your eyes reveal about your blood sugar levels:

1\. Puffy eyelids and edema indicate high sugar, as excess glucose causes fluid retention.

2\. Glaucoma, caused by high sugar levels leading to increased intraocular pressure, results from glycation and abnormal blood vessel formation.

3\. Cataracts occur when high sugar levels misfold lens proteins and deplete vitamin B1; supplements like B1 and carnosine can help.

4\. Retinopathy, damaging the retina and nerves, can lead to blindness; benfotiamine, a B1 supplement, may aid repair alongside dietary changes.

5\. Macular degeneration affects focus and is influenced by diet; lutein helps but diet improvements are crucial.

6\. Red, irritated eyes result from inflammation and damaged blood vessels due to high sugar; blood sugar normalization is necessary.

7\. Dry eyes, often from vitamin A deficiency and low zinc, are exacerbated by high sugar, which depletes zinc levels.

## What single food has been identified as particularly effective in alleviating a wide range of menopausal symptoms?

Menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, and depression are often linked to reduced estrogen and progesterone due to ovarian decline. While many healthcare providers suggest hormone replacement therapy (HRT), it’s important to recognize the role of the adrenal glands, which produce hormones that can compensate for lost ovarian function.

These steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol, primarily sourced from animal products. Incorporating cholesterol-rich foods such as grass-fed butter, egg yolks, shrimp, seafood, and organ meats into your diet can support hormone production and alleviate menopausal symptoms. Unlike plant sources, animal products provide the necessary precursors for synthesizing these hormones effectively.

***

## What specific nutrient deficiencies are associated with the manifestation of dry skin?

Dry skin is often indicative of an essential fatty acid deficiency, particularly in omega-3 fatty acids. While deficiencies in omega-6 are uncommon, a significant portion of the population lacks adequate omega-3 intake. To mitigate this issue, it is advisable to enhance your diet with omega-3-rich foods, such as fish oils, sardines, salmon, walnuts, chia seeds, and algae like blue-green algae and seaweed. These sources offer both direct and precursor forms of omega-3 fatty acids, which are vital for maintaining optimal skin health.

So one thing about the liver is it really doesn't give you any symptoms until later. It's kind of good that this showed up just so you can start working on your liver. The liver is the only organ that can completely 100% rejuvenate. It's rough, it's rugged. **So I would start taking milk thistle right away. That's one thing. And TUDCA, which will help to thin the bile because that liver enzyme is usually involved with a backup of more of the bile ducts and that which the Tudka is a natural way of thinning the bile, but then the milk thistle will actually protect the liver and bring down those enzymes.** And then of course, I'm assuming you're doing the healthy version of ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting. Hopefully you are and you can.

If you get on a ketogenic diet, you're going to find your liver enzymes probably will be much, much better in a couple of months because reducing the carbs is going to take a big stress off the inflammation in the liver. And one thing that's cool, if you do have any fat in the liver, which I don't know if you do, you have to do an ultrasound for that. You'll find that within even two weeks, you can reduce like 50% of the fat off the liver if you do the ketogenic diet correctly.

**There's a lot of things you can do for the liver, but I would stick with the TUDCA, the milk thistle, and I would do low carb and then get it retested. I think that enzyme will come down, but there's not a lot of things you can do medically to reverse liver disease because everything is involving toxicity. So really the natural way is the best way to approach this. And a lot of the foods that are good for the liver are like the persimmons, vegetables, microgreens, sprouts, and healthy proteins like eggs and things like that too. Eggs are really good for the liver. And so is grass-fed beef. That's really good for the liver too because it has the choline, which will protect the liver. Those are the things that I would suggest. And I think that can turn things around for you.**

Now, because the uricidal does water down the bile, should I stop that and just take the TUDCA? That's a really good question that I can't tell you not to take it, but I would just research the side effects from that and then research TUDCA. And then you make up your own mind based on the data because I think you'll be pleasantly surprised if you look at the wider viewpoint on this and side effects and benefits.

## What steps can I take to eliminate liver cysts?

The body’s formation of granuloma annulare is often a protective response to wall off an infection, microbe, or toxin. To address this, I recommend exploring my videos, particularly those related to biofilms. Additionally, consider following the protocols for the liver body type, which I’ve also discussed in my videos. Adhering to these guidelines for a period may lead to a reduction in cysts, although it’s important to note that they are typically benign and may not always resolve completely.

TUDCA has shown promising research regarding its potential to decrease cyst formation, but it should be viewed as a supplementary remedy. Prioritize implementing dietary changes, as a proper diet is the most critical first step in this process.

## What steps should be taken if you're experiencing unexplained back pain?

First try the techniques in the video, and see if your lower back pain resolves. If not, then this could be why you still have lower back pain:

**You could have kidney stones.** They often occur only on one side. You can get them if you’re consuming a lot of spinach and nuts, and not drinking enough lemon juice in water. An excellent remedy for either oxalate stones or uric acid stones is hydroxy-citrate. I don’t recommend any particular brand, but you can research it yourself. It’s a very powerful compound that helps dissolve stones. I believe it’s more effective than potassium citrate.

**To prevent kidney stones, drink lemon juice in your water. Apple cider vinegar is another good remedy.**

**You could have endometriosis,** which is excess tissues growing in your abdomen. There’s a high level of estrogen involved. You could have fibroids, which is also a condition of estrogen dominance, or ovarian cysts. Another possibility is poly cystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which is a condition of high levels of androgens. If you have any of these, increase your intake of cruciferous vegetables, eliminate dairy, increase your intake of sea kelp, and do intermittent fasting.

**You also want to go low carb if you have PCOS.** High carbs increase your insulin, which in turn increases your androgens. In other words, do healthy keto.

**You may have an enlarged prostate**, in which case do keto and intermittent fasting, but also avoid dairy.

**Repetitive exercises** may also be the cause of your lower back pain. If possible, reverse the direction of the exercise to balance it out. If you’re a cyclist, the muscles you build up in your legs can throw off your lower back.

**Finally, you may be sitting too much!** Get a foam roller and put it under your back to create the arch it needs.

## What steps should be taken to address an ear infection?

This ear infection is also called otitis media. The word "media" comes from the word "middle". These types of ear infections originate in the middle ear.

The middle ear has a small tube that is about an inch and a half that connects your middle ear to the back of your throat. This tube is typically collapsed, which prevents mucus from backing up into the ear, and it helps equalize the pressure in your ear. The tube also helps drain fluid from the middle ear.

A drop of colloidal silver can help with ear infections. It has powerful antibacterial and antiviral properties. Garlic oil mixed with olive oil also works very well. Finally, you want to avoid all milk products and sugars.

Children who are breastfed also have lower rates of ear infections than children who are not breastfed.

## What strategies and lifestyle changes can be employed to help achieve remission in individuals with multiple sclerosis?

Dr. Coimbra’s protocol for managing multiple sclerosis emphasizes the use of high doses of vitamin D3 to enhance the regulation of autoimmune conditions. However, it is important to be aware of potential symptoms of hypercalcemia—such as increased thirst, abdominal pain, nausea, and confusion—that may arise from elevated vitamin D levels. Vitamin D functions as an immune modulator, influencing over 3,000 genes and regulating immune cell activity through specific receptors.

To optimize vitamin D absorption, it is essential to consider the role of various nutrients, including DHA, zinc, vitamin K2 (MK7), magnesium, choline, B2, B12, folate, chromium, and selenium. Key recommendations for individuals following this protocol include avoiding dairy products and maintaining adequate hydration.

## What strategies and lifestyle changes can be implemented to effectively reduce the risk of cancer?

Would you be willing to invest 14 cents a day in your health, to decrease your risk of cancer? Good news: consuming broccoli sprouts is an inexpensive yet highly effective preventative. These sprouts have ten to one hundred times the concentration of a sulphur-rich phytonutrient called sulforaphane, as compared to mature broccoli. One ounce of broccoli sprouts is equivalent to two pounds of adult broccoli.

Broccoli sprouts are the tiny plants that take 3 to 4 days to sprout from seed. You can get them at grocery stores, often at the salad bar. I highly recommend putting them on your salad each day as a kind of health insurance. Their sulphur content helps neutralize and expel the toxins that can cause cancer.

Of course, if you buy them already sprouted they’re more expensive. 14 cents per day is the cost for you to sprout them yourself. I’ve sprouted them myself for quite a few years. It’s simple and inexpensive to get the equipment you need; simply look up the directions online.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death behind heart disease. Broccoli sprouts support what’s called phase 1 and phase 2 detoxification in your liver. This means the sprouts contain enzymes that turn poison into harmless particles, which is important since toxins in the body are the cause of cancer. Sulforaphane in the sprouts helps to dismantle and clean out the toxins. While other sprouts like radish and kale have a similar effect, broccoli is the most powerful to help reduce your risk of cancer.

**\*The above information is not ntended for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. You should consult with your physician if you have any health concerns.**

## What strategies and treatments can effectively relieve congestion in the lungs, and how do they promote respiratory health and ease symptoms?

Salt inhalers are incredible remedies for:

• Asthma

• Bronchitis

• Allergies

• Sinus congestion

• Mucus

• Hay fever

• COPD

• Sleep apnea

• Adrenal fatigue

A salt inhaler is sort of like a neti pot for your lungs. You open up the bottom and add a small amount of Himalayan sea salt. Next, you use your mouth on this and breathe in to inhale the salt. The ions minerals from the sea salt go into the lungs, and they are anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial. This process helps support the adrenals, loser mucus, and suppress a sensitive immune system.

## What strategies can be employed to address feelings of fatigue when unable to fall asleep?

**Try these 7 tips for falling asleep easier when you’re tired:**

1\. No water past 7 pm - Consuming water before bed can cause you to feel like you have to use the restroom, especially if you have insulin resistance or pre-diabetes.

2\. Limit caffeine intake - One 8oz cup of coffee a day should be your limit. Excess caffeine can make it difficult to fall asleep.

3\. Limit protein - Too much protein can act as a stimulant. Keep your protein consumption to 3 to 8 oz per meal.

4\. Use up body energy - Having too much energy before bed can make it difficult to fall asleep. Try using up your energy by going on long walks, exercising, and doing physical work.

5\. Catch the first circadian wave - Your first circadian wave is typically around 9:30 pm. Try to catch this wave to make falling to sleep easier.

6\. Take a sleep aid before bed - Natural sleep aids can help you get to sleep faster when it comes time for bed. Calcium lactate is a great natural supplement that can help with sleep.

7\. Keep your room on the colder side - A warm body temperate may keep you up at night. People tend to sleep better in a slightly cool environment.

## What strategies can be employed to effectively manage elevated bilirubin levels in the body?

To address high levels of bilirubin, consider incorporating a comprehensive approach:

Firstly, a gallbladder formula containing bile salts can aid in improving bile flow, which helps in the breakdown of bilirubin. Additionally, supplementing with milk thistle can support liver health and enhance its ability to metabolize bilirubin effectively.

Adopting a healthy ketogenic diet may also benefit liver function by reducing inflammation and supporting metabolic processes. This dietary approach can provide essential nutrients while minimizing stress on the liver.

Consulting with a healthcare provider is advisable to ensure personalized guidance and monitoring as you address elevated bilirubin levels.

***

## What strategies can be employed to effectively manage Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)?

To effectively manage Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), it is advisable to reduce carbohydrate intake and emphasize the consumption of nutrient-dense foods, such as large salads and cruciferous vegetables. Milk thistle is particularly noteworthy, as it has substantial research backing its efficacy in improving fatty liver conditions. Incorporating garlic and bitter vegetables, such as arugula and dandelion greens, may also provide additional benefits. Furthermore, abstaining from alcohol is crucial for supporting liver restoration.

***

## What strategies can be employed to mitigate or reverse the health effects associated with long-term consumption of seed oils?

To reverse damage from consuming seed oils over a lifetime, transitioning to omega-3 fatty acids is crucial. This switch supports the body in gradually replacing harmful seed oils with healthier alternatives. Although it may take time—potentially a couple of years—this dietary shift can significantly improve overall health and well-being, despite other contributing factors.

***

## What strategies can be employed to naturally boost growth hormone levels as you age?

In adults, growth hormone is essential for muscle building, fat burning, and overall health, including joints and bones. Aging leads to declining levels, affecting muscle, cognition, mood, and metabolic health.

Factors hindering growth hormone include insomnia, sleep apnea, high blood sugar, insulin, chronic stress, and liver issues. Rather than synthetic replacements, supporting natural production through methods like intense exercise, milk thistle for liver support, a Healthy Keto® diet, and intermittent fasting is recommended.

For ketogenic dieters experiencing muscle dehydration, adequate electrolyte-rich hydration and adjusting carb intake to around 50 grams per day from sources like berries can help maintain muscle health without refined carbs and sugars.

## What strategies can be employed to relieve joint stiffness during menopause?

To relieve stiff joints during menopause, consider the following professional advice:

1\. Ketogenic Diet: Adopt a ketogenic diet to reduce inflammation by increasing ketone levels and reducing glucose. Avoid grains and sugars to minimize inflammatory responses.

2\. Oxalate Intake: Be mindful of high-oxalate foods like spinach, chocolate, almonds, and nuts, which can contribute to joint stiffness even on a ketogenic diet.

3\. Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Ensure sufficient intake of omega-3 fatty acids by consuming more fish, sardines, and seafood, which are essential for joint health and reducing inflammation.

These steps can help alleviate joint stiffness and improve overall well-being during menopause.

## What strategies can be implemented to improve sleep quality and boost overall energy levels throughout the day?

**To improve sleep:**

1\. Add more vegetables - 7-10 cups per day.

2\. Avoid excess protein - 3-6 ounces.

3\. Avoid too much caffeine

4\. Don't snack in the evening

5\. Avoid sugar - excess insulin causes your bladder to more active.

6\. Avoid over-training - and walk regularly.

**If you can't get to sleep - you need minerals (calcium, potassium and magnesium)**

**If you wake up at 2am in the middle of the night, then support your adrenals.**

**If your bladder is waking you up too much, then this is insulin resistance. Get on the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting.**

## What strategies can be implemented to maintain normal blood sugar levels without consuming added sugars, and how do lifestyle choices play a role in this process?

Certain parts of the brain run on glucose but that glucose can be made from dietary fat. Glycerol, a part of Triglycerides, can be converted to glucose and that’s what the brain can run on. This means we don’t need external glucose because our body can make it if it needs it.

## What strategies can be implemented to prevent fatty liver disease while losing weight?

In the book of medical physiology, there’s a section that says, “Effect of insulin lack on causing a fatty liver. Strange as it may seem, though insulin lack causes dissolution of the fat store in adipose tissue, it causes a great increase in the amount of stored triglycerides in the liver, leading to a very fatty liver.”

This means that when you lower your insulin and start burning a lot of fat, you are at risk of making your liver fatty. There are two things I want to cover on how to avoid a fatty liver when you lose weight.

**#1 You have to keep your diet high in vegetables. You need at least 7-8 cups of vegetables a day. Vegetables help clean the liver and prevent fat build-up. Avoid corn and have raw leafy greens. Kale shakes are great for getting more vegetables in your diet.**

**#2 Have apple cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar is really really good for the liver and to help dissolve a fatty liver and clean it up.**

Egg yolks are also very good for cleaning up a fatty liver. They contain B vitamins (choline) and Lecithin.

## What strategies can I employ to enhance my sleep quality while simultaneously ensuring optimal nourishment for my cells?

When someone has some type of defect in their genes, and everyone does have some defects and mutations to their genes, and there's some great DNA testing that you can do, you'll see more of this as time goes on. It doesn't mean that those genes will always be expressed, because they're not the controlling factor. You have epigenetics, which is above your genes. So it's lifestyle. It's when you eat. It's what you eat. It's the stress level, all these other things. But what you're trying to do, which is smart, is trying to do fasting. And it's been hard, so you have to snack.

First of all, you need to start including the apple cider vinegar with water with your meals, and maybe even before you go to bed, because that's one of the best things to regulate your blood sugars. Even if someone does a high-carb diet, if they consume that apple cider vinegar with water, their blood sugars will be better, even if you have something called the dawn phenomenon in the morning, where your blood sugars are high.

The other thing is to look back at my videos on your meal and compare it to what I recommend to what you're doing. You might need more fat with the meal. Because if you're truly in ketosis, to be able to get the benefits, you need to go. You should lose your appetite, so you should not be hungry at all, and you should feel good, and everything should be fine. So the fasting for your condition is so vitally important, because that way all these cool things will happen when you start fasting to your blood like normalization of all sorts of things.

You may also need to add a little bit of salt and water in the evening and drink that. That does help sleep, especially if you have what you have. And there's other remedies, too, like vitamin D3 before bed and zinc before bed. These are all just natural things that I would do versus snacking.

## What strategies can I employ to manage gastroparesis effectively?

Gastroparesis, often associated with diabetes, is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system. To manage this condition, consider incorporating alpha-lipoic acid, which can help mitigate complications related to diabetes, and benfotiamine, a B1 vitamin known for its neurological benefits. Additionally, allithiamine, a fat-soluble form of natural B1, may provide further support for central nervous system function.

***

## What strategies can I employ to manage sodium sensitivity effectively?

It seems you may fall into the category of being sodium-sensitive, meaning you might react more strongly to sodium intake. It's important to consume at least 2,000 milligrams of sodium daily for various physiological functions, including the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach.

To address any symptoms associated with sodium sensitivity, consider increasing your potassium intake. Higher potassium levels can help offset the effects of sodium and promote the excretion of excess fluids. Additionally, it's worth noting that other minerals, particularly electrolytes, play a crucial role in overall balance. You might also benefit from slightly increasing your magnesium intake, but prioritizing potassium is advisable as the first step.

***

## What strategies can I implement to alleviate nighttime acid reflux?

To effectively alleviate nighttime acid reflux, it is essential to minimize the consumption of sugary foods, as they can exacerbate imbalances and worsen symptoms. Implementing a ketogenic diet along with intermittent fasting may prove beneficial in managing this condition.

Additionally, consulting with a healthcare professional for tailored advice is recommended to address acid reflux effectively.

***

## What strategies can I use to identify and address the underlying causes of psoriasis?

When addressing skin issues, it's important to consider the relationship between diet and the gut microbiome, as imbalances in gut health can manifest in skin conditions. One effective approach to explore this connection is to follow a carnivore diet for several weeks and observe any changes in your skin. This dietary shift may help reduce gut inflammation, as certain grains and fibrous foods can disrupt the microbiome and exacerbate skin problems.

## What strategies or lifestyle changes can be implemented to naturally enhance dopamine levels in the body?

Dopamine has many functions. It’s involved in body movement, sleep cycles, gastrointestinal motility, food intake, learning, kidney function, and blood pressure. Dopamine is associated with behaviors and certain emotions. However, people on the lower end of the emotional scale aren't going to just have low dopamine but also other neurotransmitters and hormones. Dopamine is increased with pleasure, but it’s also increased with stress and pain.

**Conditions related to low dopamine include:**

• Parkinson’s

• Schizophrenia

• ADD or ADHD

• Depression

Medications used to treat the above conditions can deplete other neurotransmitters and have potential side effects.

Dopamine isn’t a single molecule that works on its own to create an effect. It’s a system that creates many different effects. Trying to increase dopamine without looking at the bigger picture isn’t going to work.

**Here are some action steps you can take if you have low dopamine:**

1\. Get rid of artificial stimulus

2\. Balance dopamine and other neurotransmitters

3\. Consume a little more animal protein and fat

4\. Support your gut microbiome

5\. Get plenty of vitamin C (leafy greens or sauerkraut)

6\. Get plenty of copper (shellfish or seafood)

## What substances or products should be avoided when applying to the face, and what potential adverse effects can they have on skin health?

You should never put commercial bar soap on your face. The average store-bought bar soap is likely the reason why you need to apply lotions, creams, serums, and moisturizers to replenish your skin moisture after a shower.

**Here are the toxic ingredients you can find in commercial bar soap:**

## What supplements should individuals taking birth control pills consider incorporating into their regimen?

Birth control pills can lead to nutrient depletion and may contribute to issues related to bile production. It’s not always necessary to take additional vitamins while on birth control; instead, consider assessing your overall nutrient status. If you follow a healthy version of the ketogenic diet, you are likely obtaining adequate nutrition.

However, one concern associated with birth control pills is their potential impact on gallbladder function, which can impair the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E, K1, and K2. It may be beneficial to monitor your nutrient levels and consider targeted supplementation if deficiencies are identified.

## What test identifies soft plaque LDL cholesterol?

A CAC test gives you a score of how much plaque you have in your arteries. This test primarily detects calcified plaque, so the score usually won’t reflect soft plaque. The CAC paradox is a phenomenon that occurs after you clean up your diet and get healthy, but your CAC score rises. This doesn't mean your plaque is getting worse. It means that some of your soft plaque has stabilized and become hard plaque. Soft plaque is associated with glycation and more oxidation of the LDL. There are 2 types of LDL: small-dense pathogenic LDL and large-buoyant non-pathogenic LDL. **Myeloperoxidase and Lp-PLA2** both signify soft plaque on a blood test. An ultrasound can also detect soft plaque.

Here’s how to determine whether you have small dense LDL or large buoyant LDL. Divide the LDL by ApoB—the part of the lipoprotein that indicates the number of particles. You want your result to be greater than 1.2. This indicates large buoyant LDL.

## What therapeutic approaches and interventions can be utilized to alleviate pain associated with peripheral neuropathy?

**Peripheral neuropathy is a pain, burning pain, numbness, tingling, and numbness in your feet and hands.**

1. These are caused by the high level of sugar in the blood causing microvascular. The body does not like too much sugar, and it becomes toxic.
2. Glycation end products protein that builds up because of the sugar.
3. Deficiencies in Vitamin B12 and B1, which causes short-circuiting of the electric flow and start getting nerve issues. The solution is to fix the insulin problem and start taking vitamins B12, and B1 in fat-soluble form and nutritional yeast which you can get from your nutritional store.

## What types of fat are associated with insulin resistance?

This fat is called Trans fats (edible plastics). In 2010, an average American consumes at least 5.8g of Trans fats every single day.

In 2015, the FDA classified Trans fats as “not generally recognized as safe”. The problem is that when the manufacturing company puts down 0g of Trans fat, they still allowed trans fats in the product as long as it is less than .5grams per serving size.

**Problems Caused by Trans Fats**

• Stroke

• Diabetes

• Heart Attack

**How to know if the product has Trans fats?**

• “Partially Hydrogenated” – look for this word in the product ingredients.

## What types of foods are associated with an increased risk of cancer?

Several factors can trigger cancer, including exposure to environmental toxins, aging, infections, and pollution. Here are six main foods that may potentially cause cancer:

1\. **Alcohol**: Chronic alcohol exposure can damage mitochondria, increasing cancer risk.

2\. **Trans Fats**: Found in fried foods and processed snacks, trans fats are linked to cancer and other health issues.

3\. **Burnt or Charred Meat**: Cooking meat at high temperatures forms harmful chemicals like HCAs and PAHs. Adding garlic or rosemary can reduce this risk.

4\. **Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)**: Formed when protein and sugar are heated together, AGEs are present in barbecued meats, fried foods, and ice cream.

5\. **Processed Meats**: Often contain nitrates, which are associated with increased cancer risk. Opt for grass-fed and grass-finished meat instead.

6\. **Ultra-Processed or Junk Foods**: High in sugar, unhealthy fats, and chemicals, these foods can cause inflammation and nutrient depletion.

Be cautious of Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) foods that may be unhealthy, such as maltodextrin, modified starch, high fructose corn syrup, corn oil, soy oil, canola oil, and corn syrup.

***

## What types of protein sources are least likely to trigger gout symptoms?

Uric acid, a protein byproduct, can crystallize in joints, causing inflammation, notably in gout. Key points include:

1\. Majority of uric acid (over 60%) originates internally, not from dietary sources.

2\. In gout, the issue lies predominantly in inefficient uric acid elimination by the kidneys, affecting 90% of sufferers.

On ketogenic diets and intermittent fasting:

\- Temporary spikes in uric acid occur during initial adaptation but typically normalize as the body adjusts. Uric acid serves as a potent antioxidant aiding in body healing and cleanup processes.

***

## What underlying factors could lead to elevated blood sugar levels even in the absence of sugar consumption?

Even if you don't consume sugar, you can still have high blood sugar due to your liver and kidneys producing glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis. This process generates sugar from non-carbohydrate sources like fat and protein, and is regulated by insulin. If your insulin levels are too low or if you have insulin resistance, gluconeogenesis may not be properly turned off, leading to elevated blood sugar levels. Addressing insulin resistance could help manage and lower your blood sugar more effectively.

## What underlying factors may be contributing to persistent belching?

Belching is often related to gallbladder issues, particularly if you're taking bile salts. However, another important factor could be the enzyme TUDCA, a type of bile salt that helps maintain bile flow. If you're already taking bile salts with meals and still experiencing belching, consider these steps:

1\. **Enzymes**: Insufficient digestive enzymes can strain the pancreas, especially in those with insulin resistance. Eating raw foods may improve symptoms, indicating a need for more enzymes.

2\. **Stomach Acid**: Low stomach acid can cause belching. Supplementing with betaine hydrochloride may help increase stomach acid levels.

3\. **Probiotics**: Fermentation issues in the digestive system might also be a cause. Increasing probiotics can help balance gut flora and reduce belching.

Addressing these areas can help identify and manage the underlying causes of belching.

***

## What vegetables are known to potentially increase estrogen levels?

If your ratio is very low in the type of estrogen that is protective against certain disease and very high in the type of estrogen that increases the risk for a disease, then you have to consume cruciferous.

Cruciferous vegetables has a unique compounds like Indol-3-Carbinol (I3C) that turns into DIM. There are also certain compounds in cruciferous vegetables that shift the ratio from the bad to the good estrogen.

**Cruciferous Vegetables**

• Broccoli

• Cauliflower

• Kale

• Cabbage

• Radish

• Bok Choy

• Brussel Sprouts

## What vitamin deficiency mimics dementia?

**Vitamin B12: Vital for Brain Health and Beyond**

Vitamin B12 is crucial for brain function. Deficiency can cause symptoms resembling dementia. Here's what you need to know:

* **Why B12 Matters:** Supports healthy brain cells and nerve function.
* **Where to Find It:** It is primarily found in animal products (meat, fish, dairy), though some microbes also produce it. Vegan and vegetarian diets may increase the risk of deficiency.
* **Low Stomach Acid: A Common Culprit:** Stomach acid (HCL) is needed to absorb B12. Age, antacids, and certain medications (like Metformin) can reduce HCL levels.
* **Boosting Stomach Acid:** Betaine hydrochloride may help normalize acidity.
* **Medication Side Effects:** Dementia-like symptoms can be caused by common medications like antacids, sleep aids, blood pressure drugs, and more.
* **Other Potential Nutrient Deficiencies:** Low levels of vitamin B1 (linked to high sugar/carb intake), zinc, and vitamin D can also mimic dementia symptoms.

**Preventing and Addressing B12 Deficiency**

* **Brain-Boosting Diet:** Emphasize fatty fish, seafood, and red meat while following a healthy keto and intermittent fasting plan. This provides B12 and ketones, which are an alternative fuel for the brain.
* **Supplementation:** Betaine hydrochloride may help if low stomach acid is the cause.

**\*Please keep in mind that the above is not a medical advice. You should see your doctor about any possible medical conditions.**

## What would happen to your body if you were put on 48 different medications?

This is the average number of medications a person takes in an assisted living home in the United States. Hal Cranmer, owner of A Paradise for Parents, and Claud Covaci, CEO of Synkwise, weigh in on the true cost of healthcare.

Claud is the CEO of a software company that manages the medications people take in assisted living homes. In a sampling of 100 residents, the average resident is on 48 medications. Some residents were even taking up to 91 medications! This isn’t healthcare. In Hal’s assisted living homes, he implements programs to help people get off their medications. Many of his residents have seen a 50% decrease in medication usage. Hal focuses on diet and doesn't serve ultra-processed foods in his facilities.

Dementia is the top problem in assisted living homes and is extremely expensive, costing an average of $800,000 to $1.5 million per person. Hal explains that dementia starts in your 30s and 40s, so it’s a very difficult condition to reverse. Under Hal’s protocol, he has seen improvement, even in people with dementia.

The US healthcare system is focused on medicine, not food, but food is the most significant contributor to your health! Medications treat the side effects of junk food consumption, and the side effects of medications are then treated with more medication.

The ultimate goal should be to decrease medications, get people off them, and hopefully help them regain independence. The current healthcare model does not support these goals.

One record for a single patient shows they’re on medication for high blood pressure, cholesterol, tremors, blood clots, stool softeners, antidepressants, seizures, insulin, schizophrenia, runny nose, nausea, prostate enlargement, and more. This is insane!

Failing to address the diet before prescribing these medications misses the root cause of the problems.

## What Your Urine Color Says about Your Health

**What Your Urine Color Means**

Urine is filtered blood. Your kidneys work to recycle essential substances while removing waste products as urine. Here's what your urine color might indicate:

* **Clear:** You're likely overhydrated. Proper hydration means balancing electrolytes with the right water intake. Drink when thirsty, especially during exercise or when sweating.
* **Normal Colors:** Aim for amber, yellow, or straw-colored urine. The yellow comes from a blood pigment.
* **Red/Pink:** Often means blood is present. Seek medical advice as this can indicate kidney stones, infections, menstruation, or more serious concerns.
* **Orange/Fluorescent Yellow:** Usually caused by vitamins (especially B vitamins), certain medications, or food dyes. Rarely, it might signal liver or gallbladder issues.
* **Blue/Green:** Could be due to dyes in food or medications, or medical conditions. Asparagus can sometimes turn urine green!
* **Dark Brown:** A sign of dehydration. Very dark brown urine could rarely indicate liver problems.

**Other Indicators**

* **Foamy Urine:** May mean high protein intake or, less commonly, kidney issues. Consider reducing protein and seeing if it improves.
* **Cloudy Urine:** Usually indicates an infection, like a UTI. Excess dietary sugar can contribute to UTIs.

## What's a hidden source of anxiety and stress?

### **The Hidden Stressor: Excessive News Consumption**

Today, news zips around us all the time, ready to be grabbed and read with just a flick of our fingers. It's on our phones, our TVs, and our social media feeds.

Sure, keeping up with what's happening in the world is crucial, but let's be real—being bombarded by news nonstop can really wear you down mentally.

Digging too deeply into the news daily can make us feel more stressed, anxious, and sometimes even down in the dumps. We're always on high alert, waiting for the next big story to break.

#### **Understanding the Impact on Mental Health**

When we're constantly bombarded with negative news, it triggers our body's stress response. Our heart rate increases, our muscles tense, and our mind starts racing.

As time marches on, this unrelenting stress can begin piling up, dragging down both your body and mind with a whole bunch of health issues.

According to a survey by the American Psychological Association, 56% of Americans say that following the news causes them stress. And it's not just the content of the news that's stressful - it's the sheer volume of it.

#### **The Role of Adrenal Glands in Stress**

When stressed, our adrenal glands kick into high gear, pumping hormones like [cortisol](https://www.drberg.com/blog/cortisol-extremely-simplified-by-dr-berg) and [adrenaline](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-emotion-triggers-adrenaline). These hormones are designed to help us deal with short-term stressors, like running away from a predator.

But when we're constantly exposed to fear-inducing news, our adrenal glands can get overstimulated. This can lead to [adrenal fatigue](https://www.drberg.com/blog/adrenal-fatigue), a condition where our bodies struggle to cope with stress.

### **Sensationalism in News Media**

It's no secret that some news stations use sensationalism to capture our attention. They use dramatic headlines, intense music, and even distortions of the truth to keep us glued to our screens.

But this sensationalism comes at a cost. When we're constantly exposed to fear-mongering and exaggeration, it can warp our perception of reality. We start to believe that the world is scary and dangerous, even if that's not entirely true.

### **The Experiment: A Week Without News**

So, what can we do to combat the adverse effects of excessive news consumption? Dr. Eric Berg, a renowned health educator, suggests taking a break from the news for a week.

The idea is simple: take a step back instead of constantly checking your phone or turning on the TV. Focus on other things that bring you joy and peace, like spending time with loved ones or enjoying nature.

## What's a hidden source of heart attacks/strokes?

Dr. Thomas Levy's book "Hidden Epidemic" raises concerns about a possible connection between chronic dental infections and heart health. His research suggests a link between bacteria found in root canal-treated teeth and heart issues in some patients.

These types of infections (known as chronic apical periodontitis) don't always show obvious symptoms. They might contribute to inflammation in the body, potentially impacting the heart and other areas like joints.

It's important to note that routine dental X-rays may not always catch these infections. Checking C-reactive protein levels, a marker of inflammation, could provide additional information. Remember, infections can reside in the teeth, gums, jaw, or tonsils.

Oral bacteria can contribute to oxidative stress, which is a risk factor for various health issues. Dental health is crucial for supporting the immune system and overall health. Additionally, consider liposomal vitamin C, an antioxidant that may help lessen oxidative stress.

## What's an aneurysm?

### The Silent Threat: Aneurysms and How to Protect Your Arteries

Aneurysms can be like ticking time bombs in our bodies. These weak spots in our arteries often bulge outwards without any warning signs until they rupture.

**What are Aneurysms?**

Imagine a weak spot in your artery wall that balloons outward. That's an aneurysm. They can occur anywhere in the body, but the brain (causing stroke) and aorta (the main artery leaving the heart) are common locations.

**Silent Danger:**

The scary part? Early detection is difficult because aneurysms frequently show no symptoms until they rupture.

**What Raises Your Risk?**

Several factors can weaken your arteries and increase your risk:

* **Smoking:** Smokers are four times more likely to develop an aneurysm.
* **Unhealthy Habits:** Chronic alcohol use, diabetes, high sugar intake, and seed oil consumption all contribute.
* **Inflammation:** Anything causing chronic inflammation, like dental bacteria, can be a risk factor.

**Protect Your Arteries:**

The good news: You can take steps to safeguard your blood vessels:

* **Manage Blood Pressure:** High blood pressure puts extra strain on your arteries. Increase potassium, magnesium, and vitamin D intake, and consider a low-carb diet for better control.
* **Fight Inflammation:** Avoid inflammatory foods like processed meats and refined carbohydrates.
* **Embrace Antioxidants:** These fighters combat free radical damage that weakens arteries. Berries, vegetables, and green tea are rich in antioxidants.
* **Omega-3 Power:** Fatty fish like salmon are packed with omega-3s, which promote healthy blood flow.
* **Vitamin D Boost:** Studies suggest vitamin D deficiency may be linked to aneurysms. Increase sun exposure or consider supplements.
* **Move Your Body:** Regular exercise strengthens your heart and improves blood circulation.

**Remember, a healthy lifestyle is your best defense against aneurysms. If you have a family history or suspect you might be at risk, consult your doctor for further evaluation.**

## What's an HRV?

HRV is a measurement of the variations between the heartbeats. There are different time distances between your heartbeats. The more varied the timing is between the heartbeats, the healthier a person is, and the higher the HRV is. The less varied the timing is, the less healthy the person is, and the lower the HRV is. HRV measures the autonomic nervous system. It has been well-researched and can help a person understand their ability to adapt to and recover from stress.

Many people use this technology to determine whether or not their body can handle the stress of working out on a given day. Maybe they can handle doing high-intensity training one day, but their body would do better with a day off or with low-impact exercise the next. There are many different lifestyle changes you can make to help improve your overall health. HRV technology can help give you feedback to see if what you’re doing is actually benefiting you. It can even tell you your biological age and rate of aging. You really can’t take your health to the next level if you can’t measure it. This is a fantastic and easy-to-use tool to help you do that right at home.

## What's the cause for upper left arm pain?

For someone experiencing left arm pain, it's important to consider the context and potential causes of the pain.

1. **Immediate Action for Potential Heart Issues**:
   * If there's a sudden onset of left arm pain, especially if it's accompanied by chest pain, discomfort in the jaw, shoulder, or back, or any other symptoms of a heart attack, seeking immediate medical attention is crucial. Left arm pain can be a warning sign of a heart problem, including a heart attack.
2. **Assessing for Referred Pain**:
   * Understand that pain in the left arm could be referred pain from another part of the body, such as the heart. This is because the nerves that serve the heart also supply the arm, shoulder, and jaw, making it possible for heart issues to manifest as pain in these areas.
3. **Consideration of Other Conditions**:
   * Other conditions, such as indigestion or heartburn, can sometimes cause pain on the left side, including the arm. While less common, it's a possibility worth considering if the pain occurs in relation to meals or is accompanied by symptoms of indigestion.
4. **Non-Cardiac Causes**:
   * For non-emergency situations, where the pain is not severe or accompanied by other worrying symptoms, consider common causes of arm pain such as muscle strain, injuries, or overuse—resting the arm, and applying ice to reduce inflammation.
5. **Professional Evaluation**:
   * If the pain persists, worsens, or is of concern, consulting a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation is advised. They can assess for a range of conditions, from musculoskeletal issues to more serious concerns like heart problems.
6. **Lifestyle Adjustments and Physical Therapy**:
   * For chronic issues not related to acute medical conditions, lifestyle adjustments such as ergonomic improvements at work, regular stretching, and physical therapy may be recommended to alleviate and prevent future pain.

Remember, while some arm pain can be managed with self-care, sudden, severe, or unexplained left arm pain, especially if it's potentially related to heart issues, requires immediate medical attention.

## What's the deeper cause for tonsil stones?

Tonsil stones can cause bad breath and frustration. Understanding their cause is key to prevention. Tonsils play a vital role in your immune system by capturing information about germs. Quick fixes like tonsil removal or antibiotics don't address the root issues effectively. Strengthening your immune system is crucial. Research suggests vitamin D, zinc, and iron deficiencies may contribute to tonsil inflammation. Ensure adequate intake of these nutrients through diet or supplements to support immune health and reduce the likelihood of tonsil problems.

***

## What's the deeper cause for tonsils?

The presence of tonsil stones, which cause unpleasant mouth odor, is rooted in the role of tonsils as lymphatic tissues defending against pathogens. Removal of tonsils can lead to complications such as respiratory infections, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and autoimmune disorders, as antibiotics often prove ineffective against viral tonsil infections. Strengthening the immune system is crucial to prevent tonsil stones, while promoting natural immune development in children through exposure to infections can enhance overall immune resilience. Nutrient deficiencies, especially in vitamin D, zinc, and iron, contribute to inflamed tonsils, making adequate intake of these nutrients essential through diet or supplements. Vitamin D's antimicrobial properties are particularly beneficial, emphasizing the importance of outdoor exposure and a balanced diet for optimal tonsil health.

***

## What's the difference between acute and chronic inflammation?

#### **The Difference Between Acute and Chronic Inflammation**

Acute inflammation is a short-term response to injury or infection. It's a normal part of the healing process and typically lasts a few hours to a few days.

During acute inflammation, your body releases chemicals that cause redness, swelling, heat, and pain in the affected area. This helps protect the area from further damage and promotes healing.

On the other hand, [chronic inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-10-root-causes-of-inflammation) is a prolonged inflammatory response that can last for several months to years. It occurs when your body's inflammatory response doesn't shut off, even when there's no injury or infection to fight.

Chronic inflammation can damage healthy cells, tissues, and organs over time. It's been linked to various health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and autoimmune disorders.

#### **The Role of Cytokines in Inflammation**

Cytokines are small proteins that play a crucial role in regulating inflammation. They're produced by various cells in your body, including immune cells, and help coordinate the inflammatory response.

One type of cytokine particularly important in chronic inflammation is tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that helps activate other immune cells and promotes inflammation.

In healthy individuals, TNF-alpha levels are carefully regulated to ensure inflammation occurs only when needed. However, in people with chronic inflammation, TNF-alpha levels may be persistently elevated, leading to ongoing inflammation and tissue damage.

Research has shown that chronic exposure to high levels of TNF-alpha can contribute to the development of various health problems, including:

* [Rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-best-rheumatoid-arthritis-tip)
* [Inflammatory bowel disease](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-common-nutrient-deficiency-in-ibd-inflammatory-bowel-disease)
* [Psoriasis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/a-great-psoriasis-remedy)
* [Cancer](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-6-foods-that-can-cause-cancer)
* [Depression](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-root-causes-of-depression)

Interestingly, studies have also found that high blood sugar levels can increase TNF-alpha production in the body. This may partly explain why people with diabetes are at increased risk for chronic inflammation and related health problems.

Managing chronic inflammation often involves targeting cytokines like TNF-alpha. Some medications, such as TNF inhibitors, work by blocking the activity of TNF-alpha and reducing inflammation in the body.

## What's the most serious symptom of potassium deficiency?

Potassium is essential for our health, and we need a substantial amount—approximately 4700 mg daily! Unfortunately, many people's diets are heavily skewed towards processed foods high in sodium and low in potassium, leading to an imbalance in the critical sodium-potassium ratio. Ideally, this ratio should be 2:1 in favor of potassium.

This balance is vital as every cell relies on a sodium-potassium pump to generate electrical currents, which are the driving force behind our nervous and muscular systems. Additionally, potassium plays a significant role in maintaining healthy blood vessels, and a deficiency can contribute to high blood pressure—a condition often overlooked in conventional medicine despite its prevalence.

A lack of potassium can manifest in various ways, including fatigue, muscle problems, constipation, tremors, irregular heartbeat, mental disturbances, headaches, low back pain, dizziness, excessive nighttime urination, swelling, elevated pulse rate, and even an increased risk of stroke. The most alarming consequence of severe potassium deficiency is sudden cardiac death, with a tenfold increase in risk for those with low levels.

To avoid such complications, it's crucial to incorporate potassium-rich foods into your diet. Leafy greens, squash, nuts, shellfish, bone broth, avocado, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds are excellent sources.

Conversely, a diet high in refined sugars, starches, and grains, coupled with stress, steroid use, gut inflammation, and alcohol consumption, can deplete your potassium levels. It's essential to be mindful of these factors to maintain a healthy balance and safeguard your well-being.

***

## What's the number one deficiency in all autoimmune conditions?

The most common deficiency in autoimmune conditions is vitamin D. Many people with autoimmune diseases benefit from the Coimbra protocol, which involves high doses of vitamin D and monitoring parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels to regulate calcium absorption.

Vitamin D resistance, where the body doesn't absorb vitamin D effectively, can lead to deficiencies despite normal blood levels. High PTH and low vitamin D levels suggest resistance. The solution is to increase vitamin D intake until PTH normalizes.

Factors contributing to vitamin D resistance include low sun exposure, darker skin, age, stress, location, and air pollution. Pathogens, heavy metals, and cancer can also downgrade vitamin D receptors. Adequate magnesium, zinc, and vitamin K2 are essential for proper calcium management and overall health.

***

## What's the role of Acetylcholine's in Mental Health?

**The brain functions like a complex highway, with neurotransmitters acting as traffic signals. Acetylcholine is crucial for functions like rest and digestion.**

**Acetylcholine Deficiency and Its Effects**

An acetylcholine deficiency can be likened to faulty traffic lights, leading to memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and depression. Vitamins B1 and C are essential for maintaining acetylcholine levels, and their deficiency can negatively impact mental health.

**Diet's Influence on Acetylcholine Levels**

Diet plays a significant role in acetylcholine production. High-carb and sugary diets can lower production, while consuming more greens can boost acetylcholine levels by providing necessary nutrients.

**Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Depression**

CFS is linked to depression, with sufferers being four times more likely to experience major depressive disorder. Dysfunctional mitochondria, which fail to produce enough energy, and viral infections like the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are potential contributors to this condition. An integrated treatment approach is necessary to address both the mental and physical aspects of CFS and its related depression.

## What's the worst food for my teeth?

Our diet plays a crucial role in maintaining our overall health, including the health of our teeth and gums. Certain foods can lead to tooth enamel erosion, causing dental problems such as cavities, decay, and sensitivity.

**Here are some of the worst foods you should avoid for your teeth:**

• Diet soda

• Candy

• Powdered starches

• Liquid sugar containing high-fructose corn syrup

• Soda with phosphoric acid

• Gummy bears and caramels

But out of all these, the worst food for your teeth is not sugar but citric acid!

**Citric acid is a common ingredient in many processed foods and drinks, including fruit juices, diet sodas, and even some toothpaste. Despite being found naturally in fruits like lemons and limes, the citric acid used in processed products is often synthetically made. Citric acid is a powerful calcium chelator, which means it binds with calcium and pulls it out of teeth. This can lead to erosion and demineralization of teeth, causing them to weaken and become more susceptible to cavities.**

The pH of citric acid is also a contributing factor. While the ideal pH in the mouth is slightly above 7 (neutral or slightly alkaline), citric acid has a lower pH of around 3 to 6, making it even more damaging. The worst type of citric acid for teeth is trisodium citrate, also known as sodium citrate. It's commonly found in many processed products and is a major contributor to tooth erosion.

**So what can you do to protect your teeth from the harmful effects of citric acid?**

• Rinse your mouth with water after consuming anything

• Check labels carefully and opt for products without synthetic citric acid

• Use toothpaste that does not contain citric acid, or make your own at home using natural ingredients

## When should I avoid ginger?

Don’t take ginger if you’re on Warfarin or other blood thinners like aspirin. Ginger helps thin the blood, so you also won’t want to take it if you have a bleeding disorder. Ginger inhibits insulin, so don’t take it if you’re on insulin. Ginger can lower blood pressure, so avoid it if you’re taking blood pressure medication. Ginger also stimulates the gallbladder, so don’t consume it if you have gallstones.

## Which foods are most effective for addressing depression?

**The first thing that comes to mind would be vitamin D. Vitamin D.** There is another remedy that has been known to be very, very effective and it's called methylene blue. It's the first synthetic drug that ever was developed in medicine. But there's some interesting properties. It will make your urine turn blue, but apparently it's really good for depression. But vitamin D is really key. Also light therapy. And that would be the most potent.

**What foods are high in vitamin D?** Well, you have salmon, cod liver oil, things like that. There's not a lot of foods that have vitamin D in them. So enough anyway. So you might want to just take that as a supplement at least 20,000 IUs.

Now, if that is your problem, right? And you take 2000 IUs of vitamin D3 and you're like I tried vitamin D, it didn't work. Well, I've been doing a lot of valuations in people that have DNA problems. And I'm finding hands down the great majority of them nearly always have problems with vitamin D in the converting the inactive to the active in the absorption, which means that the average person that I've tested at (25:18) least needs to take a larger amounts of vitamin D than they were before to create the effects (25:23) that they're trying to create.

IMPORTANT: Do not take methylene blue with an SSRI or anti-anxiety medication. This combination can be lethal. Methylene blue has many known drug interactions. Always consult with your perscribing doctor and/or pharmacist before starting methylene blue use.

## Which foods should be avoided if you have hypothyroidism?

**Understanding Goitrogens and Hypothyroidism**

Goitrogens are substances that can interfere with thyroid function and potentially lead to a goiter (enlarged thyroid). This is especially important to note if you have hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid).

**Foods to Limit or Avoid:**

* **Cruciferous vegetables:** Broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, etc. (Small amounts cooked/steamed may be okay.)
* **Soy products:** Tofu, tempeh, edamame
* **Cassava, lima beans, sorghum, sweet potatoes, flax seeds, millet**
* **Onions**
* **Gluten** (especially if you have a sensitivity or intolerance)

**Important Notes:**

* Cooking cruciferous vegetables can reduce their goitrogenic effects.
* Sea kelp may lessen the impact of goitrogens.
* Avoid foods that deplete selenium, iodine, iron, and vitamin A, as these nutrients are important for thyroid health.

**Foods for Thyroid Health:**

* **Selenium and Iodine:** Seafood, sea kelp, sea salt
* **Iron:** Red meat, animal products
* **Vitamin A:** Egg yolks, butter, cod liver oil, beef liver

## Which lifestyle factors affect glutathione levels?

#### **Lifestyle Factors Influencing Glutathione Levels**

In addition to diet, several lifestyle factors can impact glutathione levels for better or worse. Some of the most important include:

* Sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night to support glutathione production and recycling.
* Exercise: Regular physical activity can help boost glutathione levels, but be careful not to overdo it, as excessive exercise can deplete glutathione.
* Stress management: Chronic stress is a major driver of oxidative stress and can quickly deplete glutathione levels. Incorporate stress-reducing practices like meditation, deep breathing, and spending time in nature.
* Avoiding toxins: Minimize your exposure to environmental toxins like air pollution, pesticides, and heavy metals, which can all deplete glutathione.

## Which organ or tissue in the body has the highest concentration of CoQ10?

**The heart.** The heart is a muscle, and it has to work really hard. So it demands a tremendous amount of energy. And so CoQ10 is actually a fascinating thing that our body actually can make, and it's involved as a helper molecule in the creation of energy and the little energy factories called mitochondria. So it helps make ATP and preserve that ATP in the muscle of the heart. This is why when people take the statin drugs that block cholesterol, it also completely blocks the coenzyme Q10, and then they have the toxicity of the muscles. So they get weak muscle, inflamed muscle.

Coenzyme Q10 gives you energy, fuel, and it also protects against the waste of the creation of fuel. If you're going to, you have a lot of byproducts when you create energy, right? Like you have exhaust in your car, well, the mitochondria have kind of their own exhaust as oxidation or free radical damage. That's where coenzyme Q10 comes in.

And as you age, unfortunately, you decrease this coenzyme Q10, and then all these heart issues happen. **But now the question is, how do we increase coenzyme Q10? What food has the most coenzyme Q10? It's actually heart muscle.** And if you don't want to go that route, you can also do anything with chlorophyll. So that would be leafy greens. That can actually help build up your coenzyme Q10. So a plant gets the energy from the sun. We can't get it from the sun. We have to get it from other things indirectly. Could keep your levels higher, and I'm not talking about buying a supplement, just get it from food, you can maintain a higher level of energy, especially when you work out, especially when you climb hills, the heart muscle needs that energy. And then that's going to help you with blood pressure as well. A lot of people all just take the vitamin, but they don't they don't fix the diet because there's other things that are going to inhibit that as well.

## Which organs does alcohol affect?

Alcohol also has negative effects on other parts of the body, including:

• The brain

• The endocrine system

• The gut microbiome

• The heart

• Estrogen production in men (increases estrogen and decreases testosterone) It’s crucial to realize the negative effects of alcohol and consider the real reasons you’re drinking alcohol, like stress. Many natural things can help you reduce stress. If you can’t give up alcohol, try diluting it with sparkling water. If you take milk thistle before drinking, it can help protect the liver against poison and can help support the liver. Kombucha tea with low amounts of sugar is also a great alternative to alcohol and gives you a nice, relaxed feeling.

## Which supplement would you recommend for children with ADHD?

Addressing ADD and ADHD with Niacinamide

Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) present challenges such as hyperactivity and lack of focus. These symptoms can be significantly alleviated with a natural remedy—niacinamide, a form of vitamin B3.

Administering approximately 250 milligrams of niacinamide six to eight times a day ensures a consistent level in the bloodstream, given its water-soluble nature. A deficiency in niacinamide can lead to accelerated mental activity, resulting in difficulty focusing and hyperactivity. Supplementing with niacinamide helps to calm the nervous system at a cellular level, improving focus, task completion, and sleep quality. This approach offers a promising natural alternative for managing the symptoms of ADD and ADHD.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Which vitamin is most effective for managing arthritis?

Niacinamide, a form of vitamin B3, is the best vitamin for arthritis. Try taking around 100 to 150 milligrams of niacinamide 3 to 6 times per day, depending on the severity of your arthritis. Niacinamide is a non-toxic, effective, and affordable remedy for arthritis!

Ensure you’re consuming sufficient protein for niacinamide to help with your arthritis symptoms, and it’s also best to avoid alcohol.

***

## Which vitamin is most effective in managing migraines?

Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is particularly beneficial for managing migraines. It's important to note that over 50% of migraine cases have a genetic component, often related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria play a crucial role in energy production, and in individuals with migraines, these mitochondria may become dysfunctional, leading to hyper-excitable neurons.

Supplementing with riboflavin in higher doses, around 400 milligrams, has shown promising results for many individuals. Additionally, incorporating sea salt can be beneficial, as proper electrolyte balance is important.

Moreover, due to the oxidative stress associated with migraines, taking antioxidant-rich herbs such as ginger or turmeric may help mitigate free radical damage and provide further relief.

***

## Which vitamins and minerals should I consider after undergoing chemotherapy?

It's important to recognize that the dietary strategies for cancer prevention differ significantly from those for managing an existing cancer diagnosis. This distinction can serve as motivation to explore appropriate dietary approaches.

Cancer cells originate from normal cells that have become damaged, leading them to revert to an ancient metabolic pathway that allows them to ferment fuel and evade programmed cell death. This adaptation enables cancer cells to survive indefinitely, employing various mechanisms for their persistence.

Understanding these underlying mechanisms is crucial. Unfortunately, there is considerable confusion regarding the best approaches to take, particularly within conventional medical frameworks, where prognosis may not be optimistic. This highlights the need for comprehensive strategies that address both nutrition and overall treatment.

## Why am I short?

Stunted growth often stems from malnutrition. Zinc deficiency, for instance, can hinder growth by affecting hormone production. Issues with the pituitary gland, which regulates growth hormone, also impact height.

In children, growth hormone supports bone and muscle development, while in adults, it aids protein preservation, weight management, and anti-aging. Amino acids stimulate growth hormone production, but insufficient protein intake, high blood glucose, sugary diets, insulin resistance, and poor sleep can suppress it.

The liver produces insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), crucial for growth. Deficiencies in IGF-1, triggered by inadequate amino acids and zinc found in red meat, fish, and shellfish, can affect height. Diets high in phytic acid, common in regions like the Republic of the Congo (primarily rice, grains, corn, cereals), block zinc absorption, leading to deficiency and impacting immunity. Stress, sugar, and insulin resistance also contribute to zinc deficiency.

Vitamin D is vital for growth, but many are deficient due to reduced outdoor activity and excessive junk food consumption among children, compounded by gut inflammation hindering absorption.

## Why are my triglycerides elevated on the Carnivore Diet?

While Dr. Berg has created content on the benefits of the Carnivore Diet, we are not specialists in the diet. However, Healthy Keto, which we are specialists in, and the Carnivore Diet may both enter you into a state of ketosis due to the limited intake of carbohydrates.

In ketosis, the body starts using fat as the primary source of energy. This fat may come from stored fat in the body, even if the person is thin. Triglycerides are stored in the body's fat and are mobilized when the fat is converted to energy. This can cause an increase in triglyceride levels in the blood, which may decrease over time. However, some foods allowed in the Carnivore Diet may contain additional triglycerides that could also show up in the blood.

It's important to consult a medical professional to monitor and test any increase in triglyceride levels.

## Why Can a Fatty Liver Slow Your Thyroid - Hypothyroid?

Fatty liver disease can be caused by alcoholism, but it can also be caused by a diet rich in sugar and refined carbohydrates, with lots of frequent eating. This causes insulin spikes and can lead to insulin resistance.

These dietary choices lead to inflammation and scar tissue on the liver, eventually leading to a condition known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD).

A large abdomen or gut is one of the most common fatty liver signs, but the best way to identify a fatty liver is through ultrasound.

A fatty liver diminishes your liver function causing your cholesterol to go up, and your bile production to go down. When you don’t have enough bile, you can’t effectively remove cholesterol.

The thyroid gland produces the hormone T4, which is converted to T3 in the liver. A fatty liver causes problems with the thyroid because the liver is unable to convert T4 into T3, the active form of the thyroid hormone.

If you cannot convert enough T4 to T3, you will develop hypothyroidism. When you have a slow thyroid, you build up even more cholesterol. Hypothyroidism also slows down your metabolism and causes weight gain.

Keto and intermittent fasting address the root cause of these issues by improving the symptoms of insulin resistance. You can also increase your intake of cruciferous vegetables and all other vegetables to help reverse a fatty liver over time.

Choline is very efficient at removing fat from the liver, and can be taken as a supplement to support fatty liver disease.

## Why Diabetics on Diuretics Need Adequate Potassium Intake?

### **Why Diabetics on Diuretics Need Adequate Potassium Intake**

Diuretics can deplete potassium levels, so ensuring you get enough through diet or supplements is crucial. Diabetics especially should ensure they are getting enough potassium via diet or supplements.

#### **Get Your Potassium from These Foods**

1. **Avocado:** Avocado is rich in potassium and low in carbohydrates, making it an excellent choice to prevent potassium deficiency.
2. **Salmon**: Wild-caught salmon is a fatty fish high in potassium and provides healthy fats, helping to normalize potassium levels.
3. **Mushrooms**: Mushrooms are low in carbohydrates and contain a good amount of potassium, serving as a versatile option to prevent potassium deficiency.
4. **Broccoli**: Broccoli is a low-carb vegetable high in potassium, easily incorporated into meals to prevent potassium deficiency.
5. **Pork**: Pork is a protein-rich food containing potassium, making it a good option to prevent deficiencies.
6. **Nuts:** Certain nuts like almonds and macadamia nuts are low in carbs and contain potassium, offering a convenient snack to increase potassium intake.
7. **Dark leafy greens:** Vegetables like kale and collard greens are low in carbs and high in potassium, making them ideal for maintaining adequate potassium levels.

#### **Supplements Can Help, But Be Careful**

If you're not getting enough potassium from your diet, supplements can help. Be cautious with supplementation, as excessive amounts of potassium can result in hyperkalemia.

Most over-the-counter pills only contain 99 milligrams of potassium, so make sure you're still eating potassium-rich foods.

**Intermittent Fasting? Don't Forget Your Potassium**

If you're [practicing intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/categories/intermittent-fasting), ensure you still get enough potassium during your eating window. Nutrient-rich meals are essential.

Remember to always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have existing medical conditions or are currently taking medication.

## Why did the American Heart Association oppose the ban of junk food?

Most people know that the American Heart Association receives funding from the junk food industry, so it may not have come as a surprise that they openly rejected the SNAP reform bill. After much embarrassment, they retracted their statements and claimed to no longer oppose the bill. Soda is the most frequently purchased item under the SNAP program. Soda lobbyists argue that the SNAP reform bill violates the liberty of choosing what you want to eat and drink! Junk food companies are paying social media influencers to oppose the SNAP reform bill and focus on food insecurity. Government subsidies for food first started during the Great Depression, but they have since become much more corrupt. Today, the system continues to make the junk food industry richer. Big Food and Big Pharma continue to benefit from this system at the expense of taxpayers and the health of the American people. The SNAP program should allow people to purchase nutrient-dense foods and prevent the purchase of ultra-processed foods. This would reduce chronic disease and save people money on prescription medications. Junk food companies oppose SNAP reform because a tremendous amount of money is at stake. Soda industry subsidies alone are a 10 billion dollar business!

## Why does coffee make reflux symptoms worse?

Coffee can make acid reflux worse for several reasons:

Acidity: Coffee is acidic and contains tannic acid and other acids, which can irritate the esophagus and stomach lining, leading to acid reflux. The acid in the stomach may not be causing the reflux, but if the stomach and esophagus are already irritated due to reflux, the tannic acid will irritate them more.

Caffeine: Caffeine in coffee stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, which can relax the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). When the LES is relaxed, stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing reflux.

Chemical Additives: Non-organic coffee often contains various chemicals and pesticides, which further irritate the digestive system and exacerbate reflux symptoms.

For more information, you can refer to the following source:

## Why does fatty liver disease often present with no symptoms?

25% of the world population (adults only) has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. 40% of the US population (adults only) actually has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. It’s very common, but in most cases, there are no symptoms.

**There are two types of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease:**

1\. Fat only

2\. Fat and inflammation

The symptoms of a fatty liver don’t typically show up for many years. The situation often goes from a fatty liver to an inflamed fatty liver to cirrhosis. But, you might not know you have a fatty liver and take action until you have symptoms, which could be too late.

• 90% of obese people have NAFLD

• 60% of diabetics have NAFLD

• 20% of people with normal weight have NAFLD, with the majority also having insulin resistance

Insulin converts glucose to triglycerides. I believe high levels of insulin are what’s causing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Carbohydrates (especially fructose and omega 6 fatty acids) are what’s behind high insulin.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic fatty liver disease have different causes but the same effects. This could mean that fructose, omega-6 fatty acids, and other refined carbohydrates have a very similar effect as alcohol on the liver.

## Why does removing your gallbladder makes you fat?

Removing your gallbladder can lead to weight gain for several reasons, mainly due to the important role of bile, a substance concentrated and stored in the gallbladder, in various bodily functions.

Thyroid Hormone Conversion:

Bile is essential for converting thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism. Without enough bile, the conversion process is hampered, potentially slowing down your metabolism.

• Insulin Sensitivity: Bile helps maintain insulin sensitivity. A lack of bile can lead to increased insulin levels, contributing to weight gain.

• Gut Microbiome: A healthy gut microbiome is influenced by bile. Without sufficient bile, the balance of gut bacteria can shift, leading to weight gain.

Constipation:

Bile acts as a natural lubricant in the intestines. Without it, you might experience constipation and retain waste, adding to body weight.

• Bloating: A deficiency in bile can cause bloating and swelling in the belly area, making you feel and look heavier.

• Fatty Liver: Bile helps prevent fatty liver, a condition linked to weight gain. Without enough bile, the risk of developing fatty liver increases.

To mitigate these effects, supplementing with bile salts can be beneficial, especially for those without a gallbladder. Bile salts can help replicate some of the gallbladder's functions, aiding in digestion and preventing some of the weight gain associated with gallbladder removal.

## Why having low LDL shouldn't always be a goal when losing weight?

**LDL Cholesterol: The Misunderstood Superhero of Your Body**

LDL cholesterol, often labeled as "bad cholesterol," isn't as simple as it seems. It's a crucial lipoprotein that transports fats and vitamins throughout your bloodstream, acting as a delivery truck for essential nutrients. While it can become harmful when oxidized, its primary role is to aid in artery healing.

**The Role of Lipoproteins**

Lipoproteins like VLDL and LDL are protein shells that carry fats through your blood. VLDL delivers fats and vitamins, transforming into LDL as it unloads its cargo. LDL then continues the journey, transporting cholesterol to cells and aiding in repair processes.

**LDL's Healing Properties**

Contrary to popular belief, LDL cholesterol is instrumental in healing injured arteries. However, when there's an excess of LDL, this healing process can go into overdrive, leading to plaque formation.

**The Dangers of Oxidized LDL**

The real troublemaker is oxidized LDL, which occurs when LDL reacts with oxygen. This oxidized form triggers inflammation and contributes to artery-clogging plaques. Factors like high insulin levels, often caused by excessive sugar intake and insulin resistance, can promote LDL oxidation.

**Managing Cholesterol for Heart Health**

Maintaining healthy cholesterol levels involves a multifaceted approach:

* **Dietary Choices:** Focus on whole foods low in processed ingredients, high in fiber, healthy fats, and antioxidants. Examples include leafy greens, nuts, seeds, fatty fish, and whole grains.
* **Physical Activity:** Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise and incorporate strength training each week. Even small bursts of activity can benefit your heart health.

**Risk Factors for High LDL Cholesterol**

Several factors contribute to high LDL cholesterol levels:

* **Genetic Factors:** Conditions like familial hypercholesterolemia can cause high LDL from an early age.
* **Lifestyle Factors:** Unhealthy eating habits, lack of exercise, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and chronic stress can all elevate LDL levels.

**LDL and Metabolic Syndrome**

Understanding LDL's role in metabolic syndrome is crucial. This condition involves a cluster of risk factors, including high LDL, which increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Managing LDL levels is vital for preventing and addressing metabolic syndrome.

**Conclusion**

LDL cholesterol is more complex than its "bad cholesterol" label suggests. By understanding its vital functions and the factors that contribute to its oxidation, you can make informed decisions to protect your heart health. Remember, maintaining a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise is key to keeping your LDL levels in check and reducing the risk of cardiovascular problems.

## Why is it advisable to avoid consuming sugar?

**Breaking Free from Sugar's Grip**

It's shocking but true: the average person consumes a whopping 74 teaspoons of sugar daily! With over 200 different names and hidden forms, it's easy to unknowingly overdo it.

Sugar's addictive nature is no joke. Food addiction expert Dr. Joan Ifland explains that sugar triggers a dopamine rush in the brain, leading to a temporary high followed by a crash. Over time, this cycle desensitizes your dopamine receptors, requiring more and more sugar to get the same effect.

The good news is you can break free! By shifting your body into a fat-burning state called ketosis, you can eliminate sugar cravings in as little as 72 hours.

**How to Kick the Sugar Habit and Enter Ketosis:**

* **Limit Carbs:** Keep your daily carb intake below 30 grams. This encourages your body to burn fat for fuel instead of sugar.
* **Change Your Environment:** Remove temptations! Clear your home of sugary snacks and enlist the support of your friends and family.
* **Find Healthy Alternatives:** Sugar isn't the only way to feel good. Boost your mood with exercise, dancing, music, laughter, nature walks, helping others, or even engaging in physical work. These activities increase endorphins and oxytocin without the dopamine crash.

Remember, setbacks happen. If you slip up and indulge in sugar, don't get discouraged. Learn from it and get back on track. Minimize the damage by consuming protein and healthy fats to stabilize your blood sugar.

You have the power to overcome sugar addiction and reclaim your health. By making these changes, you'll not only feel better but also pave the way for a happier, healthier life.

## Why is it difficult to sleep without carbohydrates?

It can take a long time to fix insulin resistance, even once you make the switch to a ketogenic diet. With insulin resistance, you have higher amounts of insulin. With keto, you consume lower amounts of carbohydrates. But, you're still going to have high insulin despite cutting out the carbs because of the resistance problem.

Higher amounts of insulin can push the blood sugars down too low in the middle of the night. With low blood sugars, you have counter hormones that keep your blood sugars from going down too low. The two main ones are cortisol and adrenaline. These two hormones are behind many sleeping problems.

**What to do if you can't fall asleep without carbs:**

1\. Time (as you fix insulin resistance, this problem will get better)

2\. Take electrolytes (potassium, magnesium, and calcium)

## Why you should avoid iron supplements when sick?

### **Why You Should Avoid Iron When Sick**

Feeling sick? Skip the iron. While it's crucial for our bodies, extra iron intake during illness can be counterproductive.

#### **The Protective Mechanism of Ferritin Storage**

Ferritin stores iron and acts as a protective mechanism when we get sick. By limiting iron availability in the bloodstream, ferritin helps prevent disease-causing microbes from thriving.

However, consuming additional iron while ill could feed harmful bacteria instead of starving them off.

#### **Risks Associated with Excess Iron Consumption When Unwell**

Taking extra iron when sick undermines your body's natural defenses and poses other risks. For instance, excessive free iron levels have been linked with increased [oxidative stress](https://www.drberg.com/blog/oxidative-stress-immune-system-and-viral-infection), inflammation, and disease progression in certain conditions like infections or cancer.

* **Oxidative Stress:** Occurs when there's an imbalance between free radical and antioxidant activity in your body. An imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body may cause cellular and tissue harm.
* **Inflammation:** High levels of circulating free iron have also been associated with inflammation - another factor that can exacerbate illness symptoms.
* **Disease Progression:** Some studies suggest excess dietary or supplemental iron may contribute to disease progression in certain conditions like infections or cancer.

Avoiding high-iron foods and supplements might be beneficial during sickness periods, especially considering how easy it is for most people to meet their daily recommended intake without supplementation.

**Preventing and Addressing Hypertension: Beyond Medication**

High blood pressure, or hypertension, affects many individuals, with most cases having no clear cause. However, focusing on lifestyle changes and addressing underlying issues can be crucial in preventing and managing hypertension.

**Prevention and Natural Solutions:**

* **Vitamin D:** Maintaining sufficient levels of vitamin D is essential. Aim for 10,000 to 20,000 IU daily, especially during winter months or if you have darker skin.
* **Magnesium:** Ensure adequate magnesium intake, around 800 mg of magnesium glycinate daily. It can help regulate calcium levels and promote healthy blood pressure.
* **Diet:** Adopt a low-carb diet to minimize insulin resistance, which can contribute to high blood pressure and other health problems.
* **Potassium:** Boost your potassium consumption to 4700 mg daily to counteract excess sodium and support healthy blood pressure regulation.

**Understanding the Root Causes:**

* **Vitamin D Deficiency:** Low vitamin D can disrupt your body's water pressure control, leading to vasoconstriction and sodium retention, ultimately raising blood pressure.
* **Insulin Resistance:** A diet high in carbs and frequent snacking can trigger insulin resistance, contributing to high blood pressure and various health issues.
* **Calcium Buildup:** Excessive calcium in arteries can stiffen them, elevating blood pressure. Vitamin K2 and magnesium are vital in directing calcium to bones and preventing buildup.

**Addressing Underlying Issues:**

While medication can be helpful, addressing root causes is crucial. Remember, blood pressure is often a symptom of an underlying problem. Natural approaches, like those listed above, can offer effective and sustainable solutions.

**Remember:** Consult your doctor before making significant dietary changes or starting new supplements, especially if you have existing health conditions or are taking medications.
