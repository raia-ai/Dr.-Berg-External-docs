## ?, and what are its potential effects on muscle recovery and hypertrophy?

It might sound counterintuitive, but subjecting your body to cold temperatures could be the muscle growth boost you need. I'm talking about cold showers, ice baths, or even cryotherapy.

When you're exposed to cold, your body goes into overdrive trying to maintain its core temperature. This process generates a tremendous amount of energy, leading to the production of brown fat, a metabolically active type of fat that stimulates calorie burning and fat loss.

This can be especially beneficial for those aiming to add bulk while keeping body fat in check.

The magic, however, extends beyond fat burning. Studies, both in animals and humans, reveal that cold therapy can stimulate specific muscle genes responsible for muscle growth. It’s almost like hitting the reset button on your body, prompting it to adapt and grow stronger.

Additionally, it can reduce post-workout inflammation, promoting faster recovery and muscle repair. This enhanced recovery can help you get back to your training program faster and continue making progress toward your muscle growth goals.

Don't be scared to embrace the chill. Start with short bursts of cold exposure and gradually increase the duration as your tolerance builds. Remember, it’s the shock and recovery cycle that does the trick.

## Are antibiotic drinks effective?

Antibiotics only address bacteria—they don't target yeast, parasites, viruses, fungus, or mold. This natural antimicrobial remedy uses powerful chemicals from plants that have antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and antiparasitic properties to help support the immune system and fight against pathogens.

Of course, this antibiotic/antimicrobial home remedy has fewer side effects than a conventional antibiotic. Your immune system is your greatest weapon against infections. All we want to do is use natural compounds to enhance the immune system's defenses.

**Here's how to make the best natural antibiotic drink!**

**Ingredients:**

• 15 garlic cloves

• 1 whole lemon

• 1 Tbsp turmeric powder

• 1/4 cup grated ginger

• 1/4 cup manuka honey

• 1 oz olive oil (or 1 tsp coconut oil)

• 3 oz apple cider vinegar

• 1 cup water

**Directions:** Add the ingredients to a blender and blend for 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a 16 oz mason jar and pour in additional water until the mixture is about a 1/2 inch from the top of the jar. Seal the jar and keep it in the refrigerator. The longer this formula is in the refrigerator, the more potent it will become.

**How to take this natural antimicrobial remedy:** At the first sign of sickness, take a shot of this drink. You can then take an additional four shots of this remedy throughout the day.

## Are dietary supplements essential for maintaining health if a person is already healthy and following a balanced diet?

**What Does "Healthy" Really Mean?**

You might think you're healthy if you're not taking medications or visibly overweight. But true health goes deeper – it's about boundless energy, deep sleep, balanced digestion, zero inflammation, and strong adrenal function. Honestly, I haven't met many people who fit that description perfectly! We all have our own health struggles.

**Why Supplements Matter, Even for the "Healthy"**

Even if you feel great, our modern world makes it tough to get all the nutrients you need from food alone. American soil is often depleted, leaving our fruits and vegetables lacking compared to those grown in other parts of the world. Unless you were raised on food sourced from incredibly rich soil, that's a whole different story.

**Your Past Shapes Your Present**

Your history influences your current health – your past diet, stress levels, and exercise habits. Supplements can be crucial in supporting those weak links, which often show up as digestive problems, adrenal fatigue, inflammation, or sleep issues.

**Detox and the Power of Food (and Supplements)**

True detoxification requires a ton of vegetables, especially the cruciferous kind. But most of us don't eat the huge quantities needed to hit our daily nutrient targets. Think about it – do you consistently eat seven to ten cups of high-quality veggies to get your 4,700mg of potassium? That's where my supplements come in – they fill the gaps and bolster those areas where you might need the most support.

## Are diuretics helpful for high blood pressure?

The most common treatment for high blood pressure is diuretics. But, diuretics can cause you to lose both sodium and potassium. People who are salt sensitive or who have symptoms of a sodium deficiency are really deficient in potassium.

Sodium and potassium work together in the body, and you need twice as much potassium as you do sodium. The average person needs 2300mg of sodium and 4700mg of potassium per day.

## Are eggs beneficial for brain health?

There is a natural compound in egg yolks called phosphatidylcholine, which has huge benefits on your cell membranes, the brain and nervous system.

It is also beneficial in hepatitis type A, B and C. You can also get this in certain fish and soybeans however, soy is mainly GMO, so avoid it. There are no bad effects when you consume organic pasture-raised eggs, so don't be afraid to use them on a regular basis.

## Are grass-fed meats healthier compared to conventionally raised meats?

Grass-fed means that animals were fed on grass. However, you should know that there is no legal definition for the word grass-fed. So you don’t know how long the animal was fed grass, in actuality. It could be several months, it could be a year, you don’t know. What is really important is that it says grass-finished. If it doesn’t say grass-finished, it means grain-finished, which has a difference in health benefits for the body. Ideally, you would want to have grass-fed, grass- finished, 100% certified organic food.

Grass-fed beef and other animal products are far better than grain-fed animal products. Comparing grass-fed to grain-fed animal products, grass-fed products have five times more omega-3 fatty acids. They also have much lower levels of omega-6 fatty acids, and that is ideal for the omega-3 to omega-6 ratio. Omega-6 fatty acids can be highly inflammatory in excess amounts.

Additionally, In grass-fed meat, there are three times more CLA, which is a powerful antioxidant. CLA is important for cardiovascular function.

**Benefits**

*   Compared to regular meat, grass-fed meat contains far more

    • vitamins • minerals

    * antioxidants (carotenoids, which come from grass)
    * other vital nutrients
* Grass-fed meat is not heavy in omega-6 fatty acids, compared to grain-fed meat
* Grass-fed beef has CLA, and far more vitamin A and vitamin E
* Grass-fed meat doesn’t contain GMOs

**Where to get it**

You can get grass-fed meat at a grocery or health food store. Ideally, you want to consume grass-fed, grass-finished, 100% certified organic meats, eggs and dairy products. One company Dr. Berg personally uses is called U.S. Wellness Meats.

## Are herbal diuretics safe to use, and what potential risks or side effects should be considered?

Herbal diuretics are generally safe when used in moderation and as directed by a healthcare professional.

Choosing high-quality products from reputable sources and consulting your doctor before using herbal supplements or remedies if you have existing health conditions or take medications is essential.

## Are ketones toxic byproducts or therapeutic fuels, and what factors affect their role in metabolism and health?

A woman asked me how to respond to her doctor, who told her that being in ketosis is life-threatening. This is completely untrue - yet it’s a surprisingly common mistake that medical professionals make. They confuse nutritional ketosis with another condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, which is indeed life-threatening. It happens if you’re a type 1 diabetic who runs out of insulin, which allows your ketone levels to rise to dangerous amounts. But if you’re not a type 1 diabetic, you won’t run out of insulin, and you aren’t at risk for ketoacidosis.

By contrast, you get into ketosis by dropping your carbohydrate consumption. Your body turns its own fat, and the fat you eat, into ketones. Ketones are therapeutic for your body. They aren’t dangerous!

A lot of research is being done on the benefits of ketones for someone with a brain injury. Ketones are a more efficient fuel. They need less oxygen and produce less waste than glucose. They’re neuroprotective; they guard against nerve damage caused by high levels of glucose. When you switch to a ketogenic diet, you can actually recover damaged brain cells. Your energy goes up; your need for sleep decreases; you can actually decrease your blood flow by nearly forty percent.

Being in ketosis can help prevent protein from accumulating in the brain, preventing the amyloid plaques that lead to Alzheimer’s.

A real danger is high levels of glucose, which can cause substantial health problems, including:

• Brain Shrinkage

• Fluid retention

• Memory loss

• Mood disorders

• Oxidative damage

• Glycation

• Fatigue

• Lowered oxygen levels

• Amyloid plaques

See how therapeutic ketones truly are?

## Can apple cider vinegar (ACV) help boost energy levels, and what evidence supports its effectiveness in enhancing vitality and reducing fatigue?

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) has long been used as a natural remedy, and it can also boost your energy levels. Here's how ACV interacts with your body's metabolic processes:

**Acetic Acid as a Source of Fuel**

\- Primary Component: The main component of ACV is acetic acid.

\- Energy Conversion: Your body converts acetic acid into ketones, which are energy molecules that tissues can use directly.

\- Daily Boost: Adding a tablespoon or two of ACV to a glass of water can increase your energy levels throughout the day.

**The Role of Gut Microbes**

\- Gut Health: ACV supports gut health by promoting beneficial bacteria.

\- Fermentation Benefits: These bacteria ferment acetic acid into compounds like butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids.

\- Health Benefits: These compounds help regulate blood sugar, reduce inflammation, and promote colon health, leading to more stable energy levels.

**Incorporating ACV into your routine, such as adding it to water after meals, can help stabilize energy by supporting gut health and blood sugar regulation.**

## Can apple cider vinegar be beneficial for managing symptoms or issues associated with menopause?

Apple cider vinegar may offer some benefits, but its effects are relatively modest. During menopause, increased cortisol levels can lead to the mobilization of proteins and the conversion of these proteins into sugar, potentially contributing to atrophy and other issues. To address these challenges, it's essential to support the adrenal glands alongside maintaining a balanced diet. The adrenal glands take over hormone production once the ovaries cease functioning, so managing stress and supporting adrenal health are crucial for overall well-being during menopause.

***

## Can apple cider vinegar boost energy, and how might it affect metabolism and energy production?

If you’re tired all of the time or lack energy, this one is for you.

It turns out that apple cider vinegar also supports energy. Apple cider vinegar is basically acetic acid, which can be absorbed by most of your tissues as fuel. If you’re on keto and fasting but lack energy, consuming apple cider vinegar is a great way to feel more energetic. On top of increased energy, you’re getting all the tremendous health benefits of apple cider vinegar.

**How to boost your energy levels using apple cider vinegar:**

Add one to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to a 16-ounce glass of water, and drink the mixture once a day. You can also add lemon and electrolyte powder for added benefits, but that’s optional.

## Can apple cider vinegar either irritate or soothe the skin?

The pH of the skin is 5.5 (acidic) – 7 is neutral, below 7 is acidic, and higher than 7 is alkaline. The sweat and the oil(sebum) in the skin are between 4 – 5.5 acidic.

The pH of apple cider vinegar is between 2 to 3 and is 100x more acid than skin so yes it could irritate and burn the skin. Always dilute it and don’t put it directly on your skin.

Dilute 1 tbsp. in an 8oz of water.

**Health Benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar for the Skin:**

1\. Reduce Bacteria

2\. Clean Pores

3\. Make the skin softer and more elastic \*it will not get rid of acne because it is a vitamin A or a situation where there are too many androgens coming from too much insulin.

## Can augmenting dietary fiber intake serve as a viable strategy for alleviating constipation?

The recommended 7 to 10 cups of salad every day is not just for the purpose of fiber, but for the nutrients, phytonutrient, minerals and vitamins. The fiber will help to feed the colon, but if your digestive system is compromised and you don’t have the capacity to digest too much vegetables it will cause gas, bloating and pain.

**Conditions Which You Would NOT Want to Consume Fiber**

• Diverticulitis

• Constipation

• Bloating

• Abdominal Pain

• IBS

• Food Allergies

• SIBO or Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth

• Hemorrhoids

• Rectal Bleeding

**What to Do?**

• Intermittent Fasting

• Cut out fiber including vegetables for a period of time

## Can Dr. Berg recommend a brand for Lutein and Zeaxanthin?

**Dr.Berg does not provide a brand recommendation for Lutein and Zeaxanthin.**

**Supporting Eye Health: Lutein, Zeaxanthin, and Beyond**

**Contrast sensitivity loss**, an often-overlooked eye problem, can significantly impact vision, particularly in low light, by hindering the ability to differentiate shades of gray. Fortunately, proactive measures and targeted nutrients can help.

**Carotenoids** like lutein and zeaxanthin are powerful antioxidants that serve as a natural defense system for your eyes. They protect against damage from blue light, environmental chemicals, and complications related to diabetes. As we age, our natural carotenoid levels decline, reducing this crucial protection. While full-spectrum light offers some benefits, it's not a complete solution.

**Enhancing Retinal Efficiency and Boosting Carotenoids**

To improve eyesight and enhance retinal efficiency, consider these strategies:

* **Sunlight Exposure:** Sunlight is vital for overall eye and retinal health. It allows beneficial UV and infrared light into the eye and can help stimulate the eye's natural melatonin production.
* **Dietary Carotenoids:** Increase your intake of foods rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, such as **egg yolks**. Other excellent sources include leafy green vegetables (spinach, kale), corn, and orange bell peppers.

**Supplementing for Optimal Eye Health**

If you opt for **lutein and zeaxanthin supplements**, look for products that provide at least **10 mg of lutein and 2 mg of zeaxanthin** per serving. Research indicates that consistent supplementation with these amounts for 12 weeks can lead to significant improvements in conditions like **macular degeneration** and **contrast sensitivity loss**.

**Holistic Approaches to Eye Wellness**

Beyond specific nutrients, a holistic approach to diet and lifestyle plays a crucial role in eye health:

* **Ancestral Diet & Seed Oils:** As emphasized by Ophthalmologist Dr. Chris Knobbe, removing inflammatory **seed oils** from your diet and adopting an ancestral eating pattern can greatly benefit eyesight.
* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Incorporate **fatty fish** like salmon, rich in omega-3s, which support overall eye health and help reduce inflammation. **DHA**, a vital omega-3 for both brain and retinal health, is readily available in fish oil and cod liver oil.
* **Vitamin D:** This vitamin is critical for every part of the eye and may help manage conditions such as **glaucoma, macular degeneration, and retinopathy**. Aim for at least **10,000 IU of vitamin D daily**. (Note: Dr. Berg's Vitamin D3 & K2 products contain MCT oil and ox bile and do not need to be taken with fats.)
* **Vitamin A:** Essential for healthy vision, particularly **night vision**.
* **Zinc:** This mineral also plays a supportive role in overall eye health.

**Guidance for Purchasing Lutein and Zeaxanthin Supplements:**

Since Dr. Berg does not provide a brand recommendation, here's what to look for to ensure you're getting a high-quality Lutein and Zeaxanthin supplement:

1. **Specific Forms:** Look for **"Lutein"** and **"Zeaxanthin"** on the label.
2. **Dosage:** Confirm the supplement provides at least **10 mg of Lutein and 2 mg of Zeaxanthin** per serving. Higher concentrations are also available and may be beneficial depending on individual needs.
3. **Third-Party Testing:** This is crucial. Choose brands that perform and publicly share results from third-party testing for purity, potency, and absence of contaminants (e.g., heavy metals, pesticides). Look for certifications from organizations like NSF International, USP, or ConsumerLab.com.
4. **"Other Ingredients" and Fillers:** Opt for supplements with minimal and clean "other ingredients." Avoid unnecessary artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, or excessive fillers.
5. **Reputation and Transparency:** Select well-established brands with a strong reputation for quality and transparent manufacturing practices. Check their website for information on sourcing and testing.
6. **Absorption Aids:** Some formulations might include healthy fats (like olive oil or sunflower oil) to enhance the absorption of these fat-soluble carotenoids.
7. **Organic** – Check to see if the company offers an organic product.

Always consult with a healthcare professional or ophthalmologist before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have pre-existing eye conditions or are taking other medications.

## Can Hibiscus tea reduce fertility?

Yes, there is evidence that hibiscus can block the implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterus, which lowers the risk of conception and successful pregnancy outcome

***

## Can I add honey to the apple cider vinegar drink?

About 56% of honey is fructose, and 44% of it is glucose. Honey has a glycemic index of 78, which is high.

The problem with fructose is that only the cells in the liver can deal with it. So, fructose puts a lot of stress on the liver and can create a lot of problems.

If you had to choose between honey ad sugar, honey might be the better option because it has some antioxidants and some antimicrobial properties. It may also help with certain allergies. But, overall, honey is low in actual nutrients. It may be better than refined sugar, but not by much.

So, is it a good idea to mix honey and apple cider vinegar? No.

## Can I consume an antimicrobial formula containing Manuka honey without disrupting the benefits of autophagy, especially during fasting or other autophagy-promoting practices?

No, consuming Manuka honey would inhibit the benefits of autophagy due to its fructose and glucose content, which can raise insulin levels. While honey has antimicrobial properties, other options, like celery, may be better suited if you're aiming to maintain autophagy. For antimicrobial benefits, consider alternatives that do not affect autophagy.

## Can I do a massage for a better sleep?

Start at the back of the middle of the skull and, with your thumb, slowly massage forward toward the forehead. Press from back to front.

Make sure to go very slowly. Every so often, stop moving your thumbs toward each other. Use one hand to stabilize the forehead, and with the other use your thumb to press gently for several seconds in one place along the suture, to encourage a release. Be sure to press forward toward the forehead. Use your remaining fingers to support the back of the skull while you do this. Continue inching forward from the back of the skull to the front. Stop occasionally to maintain gentle pressure in one place with your thumb.

The only time you wouldn’t do this massage on someone is if they had sustained a hit on the top of their head.

## Can I take calcium and magnesium together?

Generally, it's **not recommended** to take magnesium and calcium supplements at the same time.

Here's why:

* **Competition for Absorption:** Magnesium and calcium compete for the same absorption pathways in your gut. Taking them together can lead to decreased absorption of one or both minerals.
* **Potential Imbalance:** If you're already deficient in one mineral, taking them together could further exacerbate the imbalance.

However, there are nuances to consider:

* **Specific Needs:** Some individuals might benefit from taking both supplements if they have deficiencies in both minerals. In such cases, it's important to consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dosage and timing.
* **Timing:** If you need to take both supplements, consider spacing them out by a few hours to minimize competition for absorption.

**Overall, the best approach is to:**

* **Talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian:** They can assess your individual needs and provide personalized recommendations.
* **Prioritize dietary sources:** Whenever possible, try to get these minerals from whole foods. Magnesium-rich foods include leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Calcium-rich foods include dairy products and leafy greens

**Omega-3s and Your Brain**

* Did you know a quarter of your brain's fat is DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid? This concentrated presence in the frontal cortex supports memory, focus, and attention.
* DHA safeguards neurons, protects your retina, and fights inflammation.

**Benefits Beyond the Brain**

Omega-3s impact your entire body, promoting:

* Healthy, glowing skin
* Strong bones and joints
* Liver health
* Balanced blood sugar
* Cardiovascular well-being
* Respiratory health
* Fertility
* Faster post-workout recovery

**Choosing the Right Fish Oil**

* Don't be swayed by price alone. Invest in quality fish oil to ensure it's fresh, pure, and free of heavy metals.
* Check the source and look for third-party testing.
* If the fishy taste is an issue, try pearl-form supplements or explore flavored options.

**Boost Your Omega-3 Intake with Food**

* Include fatty fish like wild-caught salmon, herring, mackerel, and sardines in your diet.
* Shellfish and grass-fed dairy also contribute to your omega-3 intake.

**Remember:** Consistent use of fish oil or cod liver oil, coupled with a diet rich in omega-3s, can have a profound positive impact on your overall health and well-being.

Let's explore these benefits in more detail and learn how to incorporate these powerful nutrients into your daily routine.

## Can I use inositol for PCOS?

PCOS occurs when the androgen male sex hormones are too high in a women’s body. Symptoms include growing facial hair, developing belly fat, and hair loss on your head. You might get a deeper voice.

High levels of androgen are caused by high levels of insulin. So of course you want to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to lower your insulin levels. But there’s a little more to it.

There’s a vitamin called inositol that’s part of the vitamin B family. Interestingly, if you suck on it, it tastes sweet. Inositol is involved in sugar metabolism. Inositol is actually nine different vitamin B compounds, Two of the nine versions are called MYO and D-chiro. I and others believe that in women with PCOS, the MYO doesn’t convert to the d-chiro. So on top of the high levels of insulin and androgens, this contributes to the problem.

When you give women with PCOS a 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, their symptoms improve, as does their fertility, weight loss, acne, and the quality of their eggs. Find an inositol supplement that has this 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, to further enhance the benefits of keto and intermittent fasting. Inositol alone won’t completely help. You’ve got to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to get your insulin levels low enough to stop driving up your androgen levels.

## Can increasing my intake of calcium citrate support bone growth, and what should I consider when adjusting my calcium supplementation?

Well peripheral neuropathy is, if you're on supplements for that, then you want to take more calcium for bones, two different problems. To build bone, you really want, it's not just about calcium.

I would recommend having the full array of trace minerals to build bone. **Make sure you have enough of the amino acids, high quality amino acids from animal meats, specifically red meat. And then also, you definitely need calcium for sure, but also the vitamins that help the calcium go into the bones, like vitamin K2.**

And so where do you get that? **That's from sauerkraut, cheese, which then you can also get the calcium as well, fatty liver, things like that, that'll give you the K2. And of course, don't forget vitamin D, so you can get that from the sun, a cow liver oil, or a supplement. Those are the things that I would focus on if you want to strengthen the bone.**

**Of course the peripheral neuropathy, that would be a combination of benfotiamine and alpha lipoic acid.**

***

## Can insulin resistance be reversed or improved?

Yes, here is what you should do:

* Go on a low-carb diet
* Do intermittent fasting (at least 18 hours a day)
* Take apple cider vinegar before bed (2 tbsp. in water)
* Regular exercise
* Take vitamin D (at least 10,000 IU per day)
* Get potassium (from a supplement or from food)
* Get vitamin B1

***

## Can magnesium deficiency cause eye twitching, and how does it affect neuromuscular function?

Magnesium plays a crucial role in muscle and nerve function.

When magnesium levels are low, your muscles and nerves can become overexcited, leading to involuntary muscle contractions or spasms. This can manifest as eye twitching, also known as eyelid myokymia.

Magnesium helps regulate calcium levels, which are also important for muscle function. Low magnesium levels can lead to an influx of calcium into muscle cells, causing them to contract more easily. This can contribute to eye twitching and other muscle cramps and spasms.

If you experience persistent eye twitching, you should speak to your healthcare professional for guidance on whether magnesium supplementation would be appropriate.

***

## Can mint be beneficial in addressing respiratory issues, and how effective is it in alleviating symptoms such as congestion or breathing difficulties?

Mint offers significant benefits for respiratory health:

\- Clears Mucus: Menthol in peppermint oil acts as a natural decongestant, helping to break down mucus and clear airways. Research indicates its efficacy in reducing symptoms of acute bronchitis when used alongside conventional treatments.

\- Eases Sinus Congestion: A combination of peppermint oil and fennel can alleviate sinus congestion by soothing inflamed nasal passages and enhancing breathability.

\- Soothes Coughs: Menthol serves as an expectorant, loosening chest congestion and reducing cough severity. Lozenges containing menthol can effectively suppress cough reflexes.

Incorporating mint and calcium-rich foods into your diet can provide additional relief and support respiratory health.

## Can onions boost testosterone levels, and which compounds contribute to this effect on hormone regulation?

Testosterone does a lot in the body, including increasing libido, controlling male characteristics, and increasing muscle growth. When someone takes testosterone, they inactivate the gland that makes the hormone. Generally, we want to choose natural ways to increase testosterone, which can involve natural glandular therapy. Onions are high in quercetin, which triggers the luteinizing hormone. Luteinizing hormone controls and can increase the production of testosterone in males.

**Onions also have a lot of additional health benefits:**

• They have powerful antioxidant effects

• They have properties that help with insulin resistance

• They have anti-cancer properties

• They can help increase nitric oxide to support the vascular system

• They may help reduce the risk of cataracts

• They may help reduce the risk of allergies

• They have potent anti-inflammatory properties

• They may help decrease blood pressure

• They can act as a diuretic

It’s best to consume raw onions to support healthy testosterone levels. However, you can sauté the onions or cook them—just be sure not to overcook them.

***

## Can phytic acid cause zinc deficiency, and how does it inhibit zinc absorption?

Foods high in phytic acid can have a negative effect on zinc absorption and can even lead to zinc deficiency. A diet high in whole grains, sugars, and carbohydrates can deplete zinc due to the high levels of phytic acid in these foods.

In addition to foods high in phytic acid, gastric bypass, digestive issues, absorption issues, GMO foods, diabetes, and liver issues can all contribute to zinc deficiency.

***

## Can proton pump inhibitors affect zinc levels in the body?

Yes, proton pump inhibitors can affect zinc levels. PPIs reduce stomach acid, which can impair the absorption of zinc from food and supplements. If you are taking PPIs and are concerned about your zinc levels, consult a healthcare professional for advice on managing your zinc intake.

***

## Can relaxation alone provide the same benefits as sleep, and how does it compare to actual sleep in terms of physical and mental health?

Relaxation can provide some benefits similar to sleep, such as reduced stress and improved alertness. However, it doesn't fully replace the restorative effects of sleep. While relaxation can help alleviate fatigue temporarily, it won't deliver the comprehensive health benefits associated with adequate sleep.

***

## Can the consumption of apple cider vinegar and cranberry juice adversely affect tooth enamel?

Apple cider vinegar and cranberry juice are highly acidic and can cause tooth enamel erosion if consumed excessively.

Rinsing your mouth or drinking a glass of water after taking an apple cider vinegar and cranberry juice drink returns the mouth’s pH to normal and helps prevent potential issues with tooth enamel.

***

## Can toothpaste be considered a viable therapeutic intervention for acne management?

Toothpaste is formulated for your teeth, not your skin. There are actually several ingredients in toothpaste that are not good for your skin.

**A few of these ingredients are:**

1\. Sodium bicarbonate This is very alkaline and can irritate your skin. It can also disrupt the natural bacteria of your skin.

2\. Sodium lauryl sulfate This can be too harsh on the skin. It can remove the oil layer and can cause irritation or even a rash.

3\. Triclosan This may make your bacteria resistant to antibiotics.

4\. Fluoride This could create a condition called fluoroderma, which actually looks like acne. If you want nice skin, don’t put toothpaste on it.

**Instead, try these four things:**

• Lower your carbs (get on the healthy keto diet)

• Do intermittent fasting

• Take probiotics

• Avoid dairy

## Can tryptophan help improve sleep quality, and how effective is it compared to other sleep aids or strategies?

Tryptophan can aid sleep by converting into serotonin and melatonin. For best results, take it on an empty stomach, as it competes with other proteins. It is commonly included in sleep formulas due to its effectiveness and minimal side effects.

***

## Can you elaborate on the biochemical nature of inositol?

Inositol is very effective in combating insulin resistance, especially when combined with Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting.

Inositol can help improve symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome(PCOS). This is because of its potent effect on insulin resistance, which often causes PCOS in the first place.

You can also take inositol for acne, which is often associated with PCOS. By improving insulin resistance, you can diminish the production of the androgens that cause acne.

Some other benefits of inositol include:

• Decreases cholesterol

• Helps neuropathy or peripheral neuropathy

• Reduces risk of kidney stones

• Helps with the menstrual cycle

• Decreases anxiety and depression

IP6 supplements are an excellent way to consume inositol. IP6 is a type of inositol and is also a phytic acid. Phytic acid is a very powerful antioxidant and chelator that helps the body get rid of excess iron.

In addition to the benefits of inositol, IP6 benefits include:

• Decreases the risk of fibroids

• Decreases the risk of cancer

• Decreases abnormal cells

Start with small amounts to gauge its impact.

***

## Do chia seeds have any benefits?

Chia seeds have also been compared to eggs. An egg contains around 7 grams of protein, while chia seeds contain 4 grams. The protein found in eggs is the most bioavailable form of protein. Chia seeds contain vitamin E, vitamin C, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium. Research suggests that chia seeds are cardioprotective, help lower blood pressure, benefit your brain, and can even help thin your blood. Chia seeds contain soluble fiber, which is the most significant benefit of consuming them.

The gel that forms when you mix chia seeds with liquid is an excellent food for your microbiome. Chia seeds can help with gut inflammation and constipation. They’re also very low in lectins. Chia seed gel contains polyphenols—plant chemicals that benefit your microbes. A healthy microbiome supports your mood, energy levels, and overall health. Consume chia seeds, fermented vegetables, sauerkraut, pickles, and kimchi regularly for a healthy microbiome.

***

## Do cruciferous vegetables work as a body detoxifier?

Cruciferous vegetables are able to help the liver detoxify by supporting phase 1 and 2 enzymatic biotransformations.

This means your body has the ability to dismantle poisons into harmless water-soluble particles.

Cruciferous vegetables—and a concentrated cruciferous vegetable phytochemical known as DIM—promotes healthy phase I detoxification and balances phase II detoxification. This allows your body to, once again, detoxify normally. The enzymes involved are called cytochrome P450.

***

## Do gelatin and hydrolyzed collagen products contain monosodium glutamate (MSG)?

Hydrolyzed collagen and gelatin contain MSG (monosodium glutamate) or create MSG during processing. The chemical breakdown of gelatin and hydrolyzed proteins like collagen releases glutamic acid, which then combines with sodium to form MSG. Gelatin, derived from collagen, also contains significant amounts of free glutamic acid that can be considered MSG.

If you are using or considering using hydrolyzed collagen or gelatin for hair growth and you are reactive to MSG, topical biotin, and consumption of trace minerals and natural plants, herbs, and roots such as saw palmetto, horsetail herb, and ginseng may be a better solution.

***

## Do men need a DIM supplement like women do?

DIM is a compound that is concentrated cruciferous. It is 25x stronger than just the vegetable itself. It is a phytonutrient, which can help not just support healthy estrogen levels but healthy testosterone levels too.

DIM inhibits aromatase, which is an enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen. Your fat cells make estrogen so the fatter you are, the more estrogen you may have.

***

## Do peanuts contain significant zinc, and how does their content compare to other nuts and sources?

A single cup of peanuts provides a rich source of plant-based protein and is a good source of zinc. Be sure to soak your peanuts to reduce the phytic acid content. You can also enjoy boiled peanuts, which contain less phytic acid.

***

## Do pillows play a role in sinus health?

Microorganisms in your pillow could be causing sinus pressure, nasal congestion, difficulty breathing, and snoring! The average pillow has 7000 spores of 4 to 16 different types of fungus, especially if your pillow is made of synthetic material. The fungus found in your pillow is a frequent cause of rhinitis, or inflammation of the sinuses. The fungus feeds on nitrogen and dead skin—and can affect the respiratory system. Fungus spores are activated by moisture, so your sweat, drool, and wet hair intensify the problem. Spores can even grow roots into the fibers of your pillow.

Here are 4 signs that fungus in your pillow may be causing sinus congestion:

1\. Discoloration on the pillow

2\. Moisture on the pillow

3\. Odors from the pillow

4\. Sudden change in mucus membranes (difficulty breathing, stuffy nose)

To solve this problem, wash your pillow at least once monthly and ensure it’s completely dried. It’s also essential to clean your pillowcase at least once per week. Your pillow won’t last forever, so be sure to replace it once yearly.

## Does chlorophyll contain magnesium?

Magnesium is indeed a central component of chlorophyll, the pigment that gives plants their green color. In plants, magnesium deficiency manifests as a loss of green coloration, often appearing as yellowing or bleaching of the leaves. This is because without sufficient magnesium, the plant cannot produce enough chlorophyll to maintain its vibrant green hue.

While it would be convenient if humans also turned green to signal magnesium deficiency, our bodies unfortunately don't work that way. We have more subtle signs and symptoms, like muscle cramps, fatigue, headaches, and irregular heartbeat, which can make it challenging to detect a deficiency early on.

That's why it's important to be aware of the risk factors for magnesium deficiency, such as certain medications, digestive issues, or poor dietary intake, and to consider getting your magnesium levels checked if you experience any concerning symptoms.

## Does Dr. Berg Sell an NAC Eye Drop Product? Best Practices for Finding NAC Eye Drops

Dr. Berg has highlighted the advantages of NAC eye drops in breaking down mucus, decreasing inflammation, enhancing antioxidant defense, stabilizing the tear film, and aiding in issues such as dry eye, corneal damage, and oxidative stress-related eye conditions. However, he does not offer an NAC eye drop product. When looking for such a product, consider these best practices:

• Look for formulations with pharmaceutical-grade NAC, ideally buffered to be pH-appropriate for eye use.

• Check for products labeled as “ophthalmic use” or “eye-friendly pH”, which indicate the drops are designed specifically for the eyes.

• Seek out reputable suppliers with verified customer reviews, a responsive support team, and transparent return policies.

• Consider contacting compounding pharmacies, which may be able to provide NAC eye drops prepared under sterile conditions.

Please avoid using NAC powders or general NAC supplements in or near the eyes, as they are not formulated for ocular use and may cause irritation or harm.

## Does exercising mess up my sleep routine?

If your heart is healthy and resilient and elastic, then the body can handle higher intensity type exercise (anaerobic and HIIT). HIIT stands for high-intensity interval training. However, if the heart is not recovering well, then walking is best and maybe even doing higher intensity exercise in the am.

Walking is a low-stress, higher oxygen type exercise (aerobic), and better for stress. If you had a history of being an athlete or doing a sport that involved lots of cardio, then your cells have developed a larger capacity to use energy and you will need to do regular exercise to release that energy.

## Does Glyphosate interfere with the absorption of copper?

Many crops are treated with the herbicide glyphosate, especially "Roundup Ready" types like soy and corn. Glyphosate gets into the soil and food. One effect of glyphosate is that it can bind to and block minerals, particularly copper, making it harder for plants (and potentially people) to get enough of it.

***

## Does Human Growth Hormone (HGH) help with tightening loose skin, and if so, how does it contribute to skin elasticity and firmness?

**HGH is considered the anti-aging hormone. One of its key functions is anything to do with protein: prevention of muscle mass loss, improvement of the collagen surrounding your joints, and providing a healthy glow to your skin.**

Some people actually get it injected, which I don’t recommend because of the side effects. And it’s expensive, about $1,500 per month. Don’t buy it! Your body makes it in the pituitary gland, and activates it through the liver.

**There are a number of things that will decrease your human growth hormone, including:**

● Stress, with its high levels of cortisol

● Sugar

● High levels of insulin, the result of frequent eating, excessive protein, being diabetic or pre-diabetic

● Overtraining, if you’re exercising too much without enough sleep

● Alcohol

**Now, I’ll explain what increases HGH. They include:**

● Exercise, which can trigger a 400 to 700 percent increase. The key is to do short bursts of high intensity training such as sprints or spin bike intervals.

● Intermittent fasting can increase HGH by up to 1,300 percent in women and 2,000 percent in men. It’s the most potent stimulator of human growth hormone.

● Going on keto, because you decrease insulin

● Getting better quality sleep

● Having a healthy liver. If your liver is fatty or you have cirrhosis, that inhibits the production of HGH.

When you take action to stimulate your own human growth hormone, you can help tighten your sagging skin.

## Does magnesium affect mood?

There are a lot of things magnesium does in the body. Magnesium even has an interesting effect on neurotransmitters.

**The effects magnesium can have on a person's mood:**

1\. Magnesium can increase serotonin (serotonin may make you feel calm, happy, and stress-free)

2\. Magnesium can decrease cortisol (cortisol is a stress hormone)

3\. Magnesium can lower adrenaline (this may help you sleep better)

4\. Magnesium can increase GABA (a neurotransmitter involved in relaxation, feeling calm, and sleep)

5\. Magnesium can increase melatonin (melatonin can help promote better sleep)

6\. Magnesium can increase the parasympathetic nervous system (it can help promote calm)

7\. Magnesium can decrease the sympathetic nervous system (the sympathetic nervous system can keep you from sleeping)

## Does magnesium work with calcium?

Magnesium plays a critical role in regulating calcium and maintaining proper muscle and nerve function.

Here's how magnesium influences calcium and overall muscle health:

* **Calcium Channel Regulation:** Magnesium helps control the flow of calcium ions in and out of cells, including muscle cells. If magnesium levels are low, calcium can flood into the cells, leading to overstimulation and muscle contractions (like eye twitching).
* **Parathyroid Hormone Regulation:** Magnesium is needed for the proper function of the parathyroid glands, which regulate calcium levels in the blood. Low magnesium may lead to impaired parathyroid function, potentially contributing to calcium imbalances.
* **Muscle Relaxation:** Magnesium acts as a natural muscle relaxant, helping to counterbalance the stimulating effects of calcium. Adequate magnesium levels promote smooth muscle function and reduce the likelihood of spasms and twitches.

If you suspect a magnesium deficiency, it's important to consult with your doctor to discuss appropriate supplementation.

***

## Does the consumption of methylene blue result in noticeable discoloration of the mouth and teeth, and if so, how long does this effect typically last?

***

## Does vitamin K2 have the ability to cross the placenta, and what implications does this have for fetal development and maternal supplementation during pregnancy?

Although vitamin K2 has been found to cross the placenta, it’s thought that only small amounts of vitamin K can enter the fetal circulation. This explains why infants are at increased risk of vitamin K deficiency and typically receive vitamin K2 supplementation immediately after birth.

***

## Does zinc carnosine help with ulcers?

It's important to understand what causes ulcers and gastritis. For the longest time, it was believed that ulcers were a result of too much stomach acid. However, recent scientific evidence found that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of peptic ulcer formation. While most people are exposed to these microbes, not everyone gets ulcers, as healthy stomach acid levels help destroy H. pylori and prevent infection and associated stomach issues. Taking antacids or histamine blockers to manage gastritis can increase the risk of infection as these drugs lower the stomach’s acidity, creating a perfect environment for H. Pylori to thrive.

In contrast, zinc carnosine is a highly effective remedy that coats the stomach, increases stomach acid production, and stimulates the production of mucous lining the stomach wall. Zinc is also a potent antibacterial agent, directly inhibiting the growth of H. pylori, which helps prevent and manage ulcers and gastritis. Carnosine, on the other hand, is broken down and converted into superoxide dismutase (SOD), a powerful antioxidant that lowers inflammation. This explains why zinc carnosine is one of the best supplements to promote intestinal health.

Consider taking 75 milligrams of zinc carnosine twice daily. Although zinc carnosine is highly effective, it doesn’t work immediately and should be taken for one to three months to see results. To find relief from stomach pain, natural remedies such as baking soda or liquid chlorophyll help soothe stomach irritation.

***

## Does zinc supplementation effectively aid in treating acute or chronic diarrhea, and what are the mechanisms behind its benefits?

**There are two main reasons why people are deficient in zinc:**

1\. They don't have enough zinc in their diet. Most zinc in the diet comes from animal products.

2\. They are consuming foods high in phytates or phytic acid, which is in the fiber part of grains. Phytates block the absorption of zinc.

**The three main purposes of zinc in relation to preventing diarrhea:**

1\. Zinc restores the mucosal barrier integrity of your intestines.

2\. Zinc is involved in the enzyme activity in intestinal cells.

3\. Zinc is needed for antibodies to fight off pathogens.

**Other natural remedies for diarrhea other than zinc:**

• Bentonite clay

• Kefir (unsweetened and whole-fat) and blackberries blended together

Another problem when it comes to diarrhea is that you lose your electrolytes and trace minerals. It may be beneficial to take trace minerals and electrolytes as well as zinc for diarrhea.

## Dr. Berg's Opinion on the Carnivore Diet

I’m going to share my opinion of the carnivore diet after following it for 2 weeks. Not everyone does well on the same diet, so it’s important to experiment with different diets to find the right one for you.

Many people do very well on the carnivore diet! The carnivore diet can be very helpful for people with gut issues and autoimmune conditions. While on the carnivore diet, I ate beef, pork, eggs, seafood, shellfish, and dairy. I discovered that I had been experiencing bloating due to my nut consumption. I didn’t experience any energy changes because I already have high energy.

For the first few days, I didn’t have any bowel movements. This was probably because my gut microbes needed to adjust.

Some people wonder about vitamin C intake on the carnivore diet. When you go on the carnivore diet, your need for vitamin C decreases.

I do not plan to continue the carnivore diet. I will continue eating the same proteins along with salads made from high-quality ingredients. I’ll also consume fermented vegetables like sauerkraut, kimchi, and pickles. I love to add extra virgin olive oil, parmigiano reggiano, nutritional yeast, and feta cheese to my salads. The calcium in cheese binds to any oxalates that are in your salad, removing them from the digestive system.

I’ll also add berries to my diet, but I won’t be eating any nuts!

## Hip Pain Relief Technique

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/the-fastest-way-to-hip-pain-relief-drberg)

You can do this technique on yourself, or you can have someone help you. This is a simple technique that you can do right at home to help get rid of hip pain fast.

Reference this video for a full demonstration of a unique technique to get hip pain relief fast! A few important points to keep in mind:

• Do not press on the side that hurts. Work on the opposite side from where you’re feeling pain.

• The way you know you’ve found the right spot is if it feels tender or sore. Apply light pressure and massage.

If this technique doesn’t work for you, you may be experiencing referred pain. For example, if you’re a female, a cyst on the ovary can cause hip pain. In this case, sea kelp may be a fantastic natural option to try.

## Home Remedy Teeth Whitening Recipe

You don’t need to go to the dentist or purchase whitening strips for white teeth. Baking soda is nonabrasive and can be used to gently scrub your teeth to remove stains and plaque. You can combine baking soda with 3% hydrogen peroxide to whiten teeth at home. Combine 1 teaspoon of baking soda with 3 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide and 8 drops of water. This mixture breaks the bonds of tooth stains, leaving you with whiter teeth. It’s also beneficial for eliminating bacteria and reducing plaque formation.

Use a toothbrush to gently polish your teeth with this paste for 1 to 2 minutes. Rinse your mouth thoroughly when you’re finished. Do this 2 to 3 times per week for a few weeks for whiter teeth. Teeth whitening should be done gradually to avoid damaging the gums and tooth enamel. Oil pulling is an ancient practice that involves swishing oil in the mouth for 10 to 20 minutes. Coconut oil is great for oil pulling. It’s high in lauric acid, a potent anti-microbial that is effective against bacteria, fungus, and candida. It also helps with bad breath. Research has found oil pulling to be as effective as prescription mouthwash against gingivitis.

Vitamin C and glucose compete in the body. Bleeding gums are often caused by low vitamin C. If you consume a lot of sugar, glucose will block your vitamin C, which will show up in your gums.

## How beneficial is electrolyte water in restoring hydration and replenishing essential nutrients following alcohol consumption?

Yes, drinking electrolyte water is an excellent strategy to rehydrate after drinking alcohol. Electrolytes play a crucial role in maintaining optimal fluid levels in cells and tissues. Alcohol triggers electrolyte loss, and replenishing electrolytes helps the body restore fluid balance.

## How beneficial is resveratrol??

People who think they have a slow metabolism actually have an efficient metabolism. This means their body requires less fuel. To lose stubborn fat, you must get your body to waste more fuel. The mitochondria are the body's “energy factories,” turning food into stored energy, known as ATP. Uncoupling occurs when the mitochondria make less ATP and more heat.

Resveratrol is a natural mitochondrial uncoupler. It’s found in grapes, cranberries, blueberries, dark chocolate, pistachios, and Japanese knotweed. Resveratrol is also made into a powder supplement. One tablespoon per day can help reduce belly fat by encouraging mitochondrial uncoupling.

Ketones can cause mitochondrial uncoupling and improve the function of the mitochondria. Cold therapy, exercise, fasting, green tea, saunas, and jacuzzis also cause mitochondrial uncoupling.

## How can ashwagandha be effectively utilized to help regulate cortisol levels?

**Ashwagandha is an herb that has been around for a very long time and has minimal side effects.**

**Potential benefits of ashwagandha:**

• It’s an incredible adaptogen (it helps you cope with stress and depression)

• It may help increase exercise performance

• It may help decrease cortisol

• It may help reduce fibroids

• It has anti-inflammatory properties

• It may help improve the immune system

• It supports cognitive function

• It may help lower blood sugar levels

It seems like natural alternatives are always attacked. Recently, there has been some fear around ashwagandha because, like other natural remedies, it’s not FDA-approved. The committees that approve drugs have a lot of conflicts of interest. Many medications that are FDA-approved have a massive number of side effects, but people take them without hesitation.

You may find it beneficial to try ashwagandha and come off of it for a while to see how you feel. Ashwagandha is powerful for stress, but you may not need it after you change your lifestyle and get rid of stress. Natural remedies are great tools but aren’t meant to be taken for the rest of your life.

## How can exercise and physical therapy be utilized effectively for stroke survivors?

### **Exercise and Physical Therapy for Stroke Survivors**

Physical activity and targeted exercises are essential components of stroke rehabilitation. They can help improve mobility, strength, and overall physical function, which are often impaired after a stroke.

#### **Regular Exercise to Increase Oxygen Supply**

Exercise is crucial for stroke recovery because it helps increase blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain. When you engage in physical activity, your heart pumps more blood, which carries more oxygen to your brain and other organs.

This increased oxygen supply can help support brain function and encourage the growth of new neural connections. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week, as tolerated and approved by your healthcare team.

#### **Engaging in Physical Therapy Exercises**

Physical therapy is a key component of stroke rehabilitation. A physical therapist can design a personalized exercise program that targets your areas of weakness and helps you regain strength, flexibility, and coordination.

These exercises may include range-of-motion exercises, strength training, balance and gait training, and functional exercises that mimic daily activities. Consistent practice of these exercises can help rewire the brain and improve motor function.

## How can glycine benefit older individuals, and what are its potential roles in supporting health and well-being as people age?

As we age, our bodies experience changes that impact health and well-being, such as joint aches, wrinkles, and muscle loss. These issues are often linked to declining collagen levels. Glycine, a key building block for collagen, can support healthy aging by mitigating some of these effects.

**Supporting Joint Health**

Age-related joint pain and stiffness are often due to the breakdown of cartilage and connective tissues. Glycine supports collagen production, essential for maintaining healthy joints. Studies suggest glycine supplementation can benefit individuals with osteoarthritis by promoting cartilage repair and regeneration, potentially reducing pain and improving mobility.

**Enhancing Sleep Quality**

Older adults frequently face sleep issues, including difficulty falling asleep and achieving restorative sleep. Glycine has been shown to improve sleep quality by promoting deeper, more restful sleep. For older individuals struggling with insomnia, glycine supplementation may enhance sleep quality and duration, supporting overall health and well-being.

## How can I assess the safety of beauty and skincare products for my needs, considering ingredients and potential allergens?

The skin is a human sponge that directly absorbs everything you put on it. An average female absorbs 4 pounds and 6 ounces of chemicals every single year or puts 515 synthetic chemicals on the skin every day. Some of these chemicals are carcinogens which are things that can cause certain types of disease.

Chemicals in Makeup:

• Carcinogens

• Neurotoxins – These go into the brain and the nervous system

• Endocrine Disruptors – Chemicals in the environment that mimic estrogen, which affect the different endocrine glands (thyroid, pancreas, adrenal gland, ovary)

**Ways to Get Chemicals Out of the Body:**

• Evaluate what your body is being exposed to – replace toxins with more natural and less toxic.

• Detox using cruciferous vegetables to help the liver break down these poisons – These are very unique vegetables that help to naturally detoxify without harmful effects.

• Do intermittent fasting – It is a physiological vacation from constantly eating all the time and gives the organs time to rest, heal and repair. It also triggers autophagy, where the body is recycling all the things that it doesn’t need and then builds new tissue.

• Make sure to eat enough healthy fats – fish (wild-caught salmon), coconut oil, seafood, nuts, seeds, olive oil, avocado

**Cruciferous Vegetables:**

• Kale

• Broccoli

• Cabbage

• Brussels sprouts

• Bok choy

• Arugula

• Collard Greens

• Radish

• Watercress

## How can I deal with hyperpigmentation?

Dark spots are often blamed on the sun, and they can become more problematic as we age. Melanocytes are cells that make the pigment melanin in your skin. These cells are affected by oxidation. To fix hyperpigmentation, focus on antioxidation from antioxidants.

Adequate vitamin D will protect you against the overproduction of melanin, preventing dark spots from forming. If you’re avoiding the sun and using sunscreen, you will be low in vitamin D! Work on increasing vitamin D levels by consuming 10,000 to 20,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily. Build antioxidant networks in the body by consuming high-quality protein such as fish, meat, and eggs. Trace minerals, including zinc, copper, and iodine, are vital. B vitamins, vitamin C, and vitamin E are also essential.

If you want a quick fix to remove uneven skin tone, use grass-fed organic plain unsweetened yogurt. Rub it into the skin and leave it on for 5 minutes before rinsing off. Add this step to your skincare routine once per week to help get rid of dark spots. Yogurt contains lactic acid at a gentle concentration that dissolves the bonds between dead skin cells that have darkened in pigment. It also provides probiotics to support the skin’s microbiome. If hyperpigmentation is severe, add a pinch of turmeric to the yogurt before applying it to your skin.

## How can I determine whether my dietary supplements include maltodextrin as an ingredient?

**Iodine mixed with water is a golden color. If you combine iodine with starch, it turns blue. When you add iodine to bread, for example, it turns blue. Or, if you put maltodextrin in water and add a few drops of iodine, the water will turn blue.**

**My brand of electrolyte powder doesn’t have any sugar or maltodextrin in it. However, when we look at a competitor’s electrolyte powder that also claims it doesn’t have sugar or maltodextrin, it turns blue when iodine is added.**

Maltodextrin behaves like sugar, spiking insulin, but can be classified on a label as a carb and not a sugar. On the glycemic index, table sugar is at 65, and glucose is at 100—maltodextrin is between 105 and 185.

Maltodextrin is the most common starch added to supplements and other products. If there is less than one gram of maltodextrin in a product per serving size, the company doesn’t even have to state it. Maltodextrin can also be found in flavorings, energy gels, sports powders, and even baby formulas. It’s important to be aware that some so-called keto-friendly products can also contain maltodextrin.

## How can I effectively balance dopamine levels and other neurotransmitters to support overall mental and emotional well-being?

Dopamine has many functions. It’s involved in body movement, sleep cycles, gastrointestinal motility, food intake, learning, kidney function, and blood pressure.\*\* Tips to help balance dopamine and other neurotransmitters naturally:\*\*

• Exercise consistently

• Get outside

• Get plenty of sun or vitamin D3

• Involve yourself in music or the arts

• Do things you like

• Get connected with other people

• Get plenty of tyrosine (consume high-quality animal protein)

***

## How can I enhance and optimize my body's antioxidant defense system?

Antioxidants are crucial for neutralizing free radicals and oxidative damage, preserving DNA integrity and overall health. They can be endogenous (produced by the body) or exogenous (from food or supplements). Glutathione from sources like beef and cruciferous vegetables, and selenium from Brazil nuts and fish, are powerful examples. Maintaining a diverse antioxidant network helps mitigate oxidative stress, supported by a healthy diet, supplements, stress management, adequate sleep, exercise, and intermittent fasting.

## How can I fall asleep in 60 seconds?

If you want to know how to fall asleep instantly, try this simple sleep technique! You’re going to breathe in a way that synchronizes your heartbeat and blood pressure to the rhythm of your breathing. This will help stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, inducing sleep very quickly. Try practicing with a timer first! Breathe in for 5 ½ seconds and breathe out for 5 ½ seconds. This will give you about 5 ½ breaths per minute. When doing this technique, breathe through your nose, and within minutes you will fall asleep.

## How can I find the silica and propolis that Dr. Berg recommends for autism?

The best practices for finding the silica and propolis Dr. Berg suggests in the 'Autism Is NOT Caused By Vaccines' video James linked to in the email. For the D3 and magnesium glycinate, please refer him to our products.

Currently, Dr. Berg does not carry a monomethylsilanetriol (MMST) silica product, nor do we have a specific brand recommendation. However, we can offer you a list of best practices to help you source a high-quality MMST product:

1. **Choose “Monomethylsilanetriol” Specifically**
   * Ensure the label clearly states “_Monomethylsilanetriol”_ (not just “silica” or “silicon”). Many cheaper products use orthosilicic acid or horsetail extract, which aren’t as bioavailable.
2. **Look for Liquid Form**
   * MMST is usually found in liquid form, which supports better absorption compared to capsules or tablets. Powders are uncommon and may not be stable.
3. **Check the Dosage**
   * Aim for 100–200 mg of elemental silicon and a suggested usage of 2 to 3 times per day. Be aware: many products list the _compound weight_, not the actual silicon content. Confirm with the manufacturer if unclear.
4. **Prioritize Purity & Simplicity**
   * Look for products with minimal ingredients — ideally just MMST, purified water, and maybe citric acid as a stabilizer. Avoid added sugars, colors, flavors, or preservatives.
5. **Demand 3rd-Party Testing**
   * Reputable companies will provide independent laboratory testing to verify potency and report on the presence of heavy metals and microbes.
6. **Check the Country of Origin**
   * Products made in the U.S., Canada, or EU countries tend to follow stricter quality and labeling standards. Be cautious with imports from unregulated sources.
7. **Read Reviews with Discernment**
   * Verified buyer reviews can provide valuable insights into product efficacy and customer service. Look for patterns, in addition to star ratings.
8. **Start Slow and Monitor**
   * Once you find a trusted product, start with a low amount, such as 100 mg once a day, and monitor how your body responds. If your body responds well, gradually increase the amount each day until you reach the 100-200 mg of elemental silica 2 to 3 times per day recommendation. Propolis has shown emerging promise in the context of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Currently, Dr. Berg does not carry a propolis product, nor does he have a specific brand recommendation. However, we can offer you a list of best practices to help you source a high-quality propolis product.
9. **Choose a Purified Extract with Consistent Bioactive Levels**
   * Seek a product that lists standardized levels of polyphenols, especially CAPE (Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester), as this is one of the most studied neuroprotective compounds in propolis.
   * Typical concentration for CAPE is 5–10% in high-potency extracts — though few products list this, so contacting the manufacturer may be necessary.
10. **Opt for Alcohol-Free for Sensitive Individuals**
    * For children or those with sensory or detox challenges, alcohol-free extracts (glycerin-based) may be gentler.
    * If using alcohol-based tinctures, you can evaporate the alcohol by adding the drops to warm water and letting it sit for 10–15 minutes.
11. **Go for Single-Origin, Lab-Tested Propolis**
    * **Brazilian green propolis** has shown promising results in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory research related to brain function.
    * Insist on third-party testing to confirm the presence of heavy metals, solvent residues, pesticide contamination, and confirmed levels of key active compounds.
    * A trustworthy company should provide a Certificate of Analysis (COA) that reports flavonoid/CAPE content, microbial safety, and purity.
12. **Avoid Multi-Ingredient Blends**
    * Avoid using propolis mixed with echinacea, elderberry, or other immune-boosting herbs unless those ingredients are also part of your protocol. You want clean, focused support.
13. **Consider Encapsulated Powder for Dosing Precision**
    * Capsules or softgels offer more precise amounts and fewer taste and sensory issues for those with oral aversions.
14. **Know the Source — and Bee-Friendly Matters**
    * Prefer propolis harvested from low-pollution, biodiverse regions (Brazil, New Zealand, or select European sources).
    * Companies that support bee conservation tend to prioritize long-term quality over mass-production shortcuts.
15. **Test Low and Slow**
    * Introduce slowly, watching for changes in behavior, digestion, or skin. Propolis is powerful — it may modulate inflammation and detox pathways, so pace matters.

## How can I fix bad circulation in legs and feet?

According to Dr. Stephen Hussey, author of "Understanding the Heart," the heart spins the blood, acting as a mechanism to create structured water. Similar to the way a tree pushes water up from the roots, increasing structured water throughout the circulatory system can improve circulation. You can increase structured water in your blood with infrared.

Over 50% of the sun's energy is infrared! Increasing sun exposure can help improve the circulation in your legs and your heart function. Infrared increases nitric oxide, which supports the arteries and healthy blood pressure.

Vitamin D from the sun also increases nitric oxide. If you have edema in the feet, potassium is one of the best natural diuretics for getting rid of excess fluid. Eliminating sugar and starches from your diet can also stop fluid retention, especially in the lower extremities. High sugar consumption depletes vitamin B1.

If you’re experiencing tingling and pain in the bottom of your feet, consuming benfotiamine—a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1—may help. Cramping in your legs and feet can also be related to a magnesium deficiency. For the best results, take 800 mg per day in the evening for several weeks. It’s also important to avoid compression socks, which can further restrict blood circulation.

Diosmin is an excellent remedy for varicose veins. If you have varicose veins, edema, or any other problems with the lower part of your body, avoid intense exercise. Instead, aim for light exercise like walking and try these simple leg circulation exercises!

What about cold feet? Cold feet are generally caused by an iodine deficiency due to a low thyroid. Sea kelp is one of the best sources of iodine.

## How can I get rid of toenail fungus?

Treating a fungal infection with medication can cause several side effects, including liver damage! Toenail fungus is often blamed on sweat and can cause other skin infections such as jock itch, athlete’s foot, beard infections, and even scalp infections. When attempting to treat a fungal infection topically, the cream will not penetrate deep enough into the nail to kill the toenail fungus.

Toenail fungus can evade your immune system through several mechanisms, including growing slowly, suppressing T cells, and going dormant for long periods of time. The T. rubrum microbe that causes toenail fungus is resistant to UV radiation. When your T cells are healthy and active, it forces this microbe into remission. A cooler, dry environment can also put it into a dormant state. A change in environment, such as pH, temperature, or moisture, can bring it out of remission.

A suppressed immune system is the leading cause of a toenail fungal infection. Stress, diabetes, obesity, antibiotics, and a vitamin D deficiency can suppress your immune system and cause toenail fungus to come out of remission.

Vitamin D is the most important nutrient for your immune function. Your toenails contain vitamin D receptors, but toenail fungus can downgrade them. Toenail fungus prevention starts with a strong immune system and a hostile environment for toenail fungus. High amounts of vitamin D can help! Consider taking at least 25,000 IU of vitamin D daily to get rid of toenail fungus.

Vitamin D strengthens the immune system and addresses toenail fungus at the systemic level. Zinc pyrithione, breathable shoes, and proper foot hygiene can also aid in toenail fungus prevention.

## How can I grow my muscles if I'm over 50 years of age?

Losing weight should help you live longer, but it’s not always that simple. As you age, it’s vital to maintain a healthy amount of lean muscle mass. Ozempic is very popular for weight loss, but trials have shown that it can cause muscle loss, not just fat loss. One study compared the use of Ozempic to a decade or more of aging. Preserving muscle mass is one of the best things you can do for longevity. Your muscles help regulate your blood sugar and support your metabolism. Sarcopenia is the term for age-related muscle loss. When you develop sarcopenia, your risk for diabetes, immune problems, and your mortality rate increases.

Exercise is the best thing you can do for your muscles. Protein is the raw material for muscle-building, so it’s essential to ensure you’re getting enough and spreading your intake throughout the day. Grass-fed red meat is the best source of protein. Poor sleep drains muscle mass more than poor diet because muscle recovery occurs when you’re sleeping.

In summary, focus on the following as you age:

•Increase lean muscle mass

•Ensure adequate protein intake

•Consume collagen

•Increase magnesium glycinate, vitamin D, zinc, selenium, copper, B vitamins, and coenzyme Q10

•Consume iron from red meat L. reuteri is a microbe with many fascinating benefits and has been shown to increase muscle stem cells. It's helped me gain 5 pounds of muscle mass!

## How can I grow taller?

To support height increase and promote growth, consider incorporating the following strategies: Ensure adequate intake of trace minerals, particularly zinc found in foods like red meat and shellfish, or through a quality trace mineral supplement. Pituitrophin PMG (SP) can also aid in supporting growth processes.

Prioritize sufficient sleep, as it plays a crucial role in growth hormone production. Avoid phytates, which can inhibit mineral absorption necessary for bone health and growth. Ensure adequate vitamin D3 through regular sunlight exposure, essential for bone development. Adopting a Healthy Keto diet and intermittent fasting regimen can also support overall health and potentially optimize growth processes.

## How can I grow thick and long lashes?

To promote the growth of long, thick eyelashes, addressing deficiencies in trace minerals is crucial for supporting protein synthesis. Specifically, zinc plays a key role in the production of prostaglandins essential for eyelash growth. Ricinoleic acid found in organic, cold-processed castor oil can also help correct deficiencies and stimulate eyelash regrowth.

Incorporating these elements, either through dietary sources or supplements, can effectively support healthier eyelash growth and density.

## How can I improve gut health with one additional microbe?

### The Gut-Brain Connection and the Power of L. reuteri

Did you know that your gut and brain are in constant communication? The vagus nerve acts as a direct link between these two vital systems, influencing both your mental and physical well-being.

**The Gut-Brain Axis:**

* **A two-way street:** Just as anxiety and depression can disrupt your gut microbiome (the community of bacteria living in your digestive tract), an imbalance in your gut can trigger or worsen mood disorders.
* **Good bacteria are key:** A healthy microbiome strengthens your gut lining, aids digestion, and keeps harmful bacteria at bay.
* **Modern life can take a toll:** Factors like antibiotics, pesticides (such as glyphosate), processed foods, stress, alcohol, and pollution can damage your gut microbiome. This can lead to:
  * Reduced neurotransmitter production
  * Blood sugar imbalances
  * "Leaky gut" (increased intestinal permeability)
  * Inflammation
  * Allergies
  * Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)

**Harnessing the Power of L. reuteri:**

Dr. William Davis, inspired by the research of Dr. Irina Conboy, has developed a simple protocol for cultivating a powerful probiotic: **L. reuteri.** Studies in rats have shown that this beneficial bacteria can:

* Boost the immune system
* Enhance muscle tone and healing
* Exhibit anti-cancer properties
* Improve coat condition
* Increase mating behavior

Remarkably, these benefits extend to humans as well!

**DIY Probiotic Yogurt:**

Here's how to make your own L. reuteri yogurt:

1. **Create a paste:** Combine one L. reuteri probiotic tablet, inulin prebiotic fiber, and 2 tablespoons of organic half-and-half.
2. **Mix thoroughly:** Add a quart of organic half-and-half to the paste and mix well.
3. **Incubate:** Pour the mixture into a yogurt maker and incubate at 99 degrees Fahrenheit for 36 hours.
4. **Enjoy!** Consume half a cup of this probiotic-rich yogurt daily to support your gut health and overall well-being.

## How can I increase blood oxygen levels through breathing?

Your red blood cells will not release oxygen unless enough carbon dioxide (CO2) is present. This is known as the Bohr effect. This means that the amount of oxygen released from your blood into your cells is dependent upon CO2. If you’re breathing a lot or hyperventilating, you’ll get too much oxygen and not enough CO2. Too much oxygen can be dangerous to the body. If you give a baby too much oxygen, it can cause blindness, an epileptic seizure, or a coma. Too much oxygen also causes oxidation.

People in a panicked state experience acute hyperventilation. Chronic hyperventilation, also known as carbon dioxide syndrome, is a lack of carbon dioxide that occurs when a person is consuming too much air. This is often triggered by stress. Mouth-breathing can deplete CO2 and inhibit oxygen absorption at the cellular level. This can affect the heart and cause hypoxia, fatigue, insomnia, muscle twitching, and increased histamine. To fix this problem, you need to train your body to breathe properly to get oxygen deep into the cells by doing the following:

1\. Relax your breathing. Take soft, gentle breaths through your diaphragm and stomach, not your upper chest. Breathe in slowly for 5 seconds and exhale for 5 seconds. Practice this before you sleep at night, while driving, or while watching TV. This simple breathing technique can help your body get out of fight-or-flight mode. You can even use a free app to help you time your breathing!

2\. Breathe through your nose. Your nose cleans, humidifies, and filters the air before it enters your lungs. Nose breathing increases your oxygen by 20%!

3\. Use nose strips. Nose strips can help open your airways and sinuses while you sleep to help you breathe better.

4\. Use mouth tape. Mouth tape can help you breathe through your nose while you sleep. You can filter the air all night, get more oxygen, and sleep better. You won’t wake up with a dry mouth, and you’ll wake up feeling refreshed. Mouth tape might even stop your snoring!

## How can I increase oxygen in cells?

Increasing oxygen in your cells is really important. Many diseases occur because of a lack of oxygen in the cells. Today, we’re going to talk about the best ways to get more oxygen into your cells.

Here are a few of the best ways to increase oxygen in the cells:

• Sleep with the window open

• Put plants in your room

• Spend time outdoors

• Do aerobic exercise

• Take methylene blue

However, there is an interesting trigger that increases available oxygen in the cells: CO2. Carbon dioxide is not just a waste product—it tells the body to release oxygen. You can use an oximeter to check your oxygen saturation, which should typically be between 95 and 99. A few ways to increase CO2 in the body are to breathe through your nose and to slow your breath, balancing your inhalation and exhalation.

## How can I regenerate my stem cells?

Here's how to keep your stem cell population at the highest level.

1\. Fasting

Prolonged fasting can boost stem cells naturally. If you can fast for 72 hours, you can boost stem cell production primarily for the gastrointestinal tract, brain, and immune system.

2\. Exercise

Intense exercise is the best way to boost stem cells for your muscles and brain. Exercise also stimulates BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which allows you to make new nerve and brain cells.

3\. Deep sleep

Sleep increases melatonin, which stimulates stem cell regeneration in your brain. Sleep also increases immune and cardiovascular stem cells.

4\. Green tea

Green tea contains the phytonutrient EGCG, which has potent anti-inflammatory properties and can increase stem cells for your brain and liver.

5\. Omega-3 fatty acids

Decreasing inflammation can boost stem cell production. Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory and can increase stem cells for your bones, cartilage, brain, and skin.

6\. Vitamin D Vitamin

D and the sun help maintain blood stem cells that are involved with the immune system. Vitamin D increases new immune cells, prevents the exhaustion of stem cells, and can even increase longevity.

7\. Cold therapy

The cold stimulates brown fat stem cells, which support muscle repair and the mitochondria, decrease inflammation, and increase blood flow.

## How can I relieve low back pain from a back injury?

After injuring his lower back at 21, Brendan did not want to accept that lower back pain was something he’d just have to deal with. The culture surrounding the lower back says that it needs to be protected, not built or rebuilt. Brendan quickly learned that no technique or lifestyle is safe enough to protect the lower back from injury or re-injury. The standard approach is that the core protects the lower back. Conservative treatment for a spinal injury focuses on everything in the core except for the lower back. With this approach, many people become more sensitive, vulnerable, and disempowered after a lower back injury. Brendan developed a program to help people slowly and safely develop a strong back. He stresses the importance of rebuilding slowly and viewing recovery as a dial rather than a light switch.

Brendan teaches people to get reacquainted with their lower back. “You can build your own back brace,” Brendan says. Brendan’s technique not only strengthens the muscles of the lower back but also increases circulation to the spine, stretches the fascia, and decreases friction around the nerves. Brendan explains that sciatica can be tricky to resolve but not impossible. He focuses on slowly strengthening muscles along the sciatic nerve. One of the best features of Brendan’s program is that he attempts to avoid pain. Three years ago, Brendan experienced chronic SI joint pain in his lower back that affected his everyday life. His problem became so severe that it affected his whole body. Brendan continues to do traditional lifts such as squats but never neglects the lower back. Brendan’s program isn’t something you’ll complete quickly. His plan takes around 1 to 2 years and can help you remodel the deepest part of your body to overcome lower back pain. His program operates on a “pay what you can” model to make it affordable for everyone.

## How can I remedy liver cirrhosis that's caused by excess iron?

If you have excess iron, it can cause a lot of inflammation in the body including inflammation in your liver. This can potentially cause damage to your liver, eventually (after a long time) resulting in liver cirrhosis. You can get too much Iron from consuming a lot of meat and proteins. Therefore, you should reduce the amount of protein and increase the quantity of vegetables in your diet.

* Avoid synthetic vitamin/mineral supplements
* Consume phytic acid (IP-6 version)
*   Consume vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)

    **\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## How can I remove skin tags and warts overnight?

High insulin can increase one's susceptibility to skin tags. People with diabetes, overweight people, and women with PCOS are at a higher risk of developing them. When you produce too much insulin over a period of time, you can develop insulin resistance. Too much insulin is caused by eating too many carbs or frequent eating. Insulin resistance makes it difficult to absorb glucose. Over time, this deprives your brain cells of fuel, leading to memory problems, concentration problems, and early dementia.

**The solution** is to give your body an alternative fuel source, such as ketones, fatty acids, and protein. To do this, lower your carbs and do intermittent fasting. This will lower insulin and prevent growths like skin tags and warts.

A virus that comes out of remission can create warts if your immune system is compromised. Sufficient vitamin D can support the immune system and put these viruses back in remission. Take 10,000 IU of vitamin D daily, especially in winter.

**Povidone iodine** is an excellent remedy for skin tags. It has potent antiviral and antimicrobial properties, so it’s also good for warts. Iodine dissolves the protein in the skin tag and acts as a dehydrator.

**Garlic** contains allicin, a powerful antiviral compound effective against warts. Because it’s often difficult to differentiate between warts and skin tags, add garlic to ensure your remedy is effective.

**Crush one clove of garlic** and combine one drop of garlic with one drop of iodine. Apply the mixture to your wart or skin tag and cover it with a band-aid. Repeat this every day until your skin tag or wart is gone.

## How can I sleep better at night?

Cortisol should be at its lowest point at 2 a.m., but for some, it’s at its highest! This can cause night waking and other sleep problems that can really interfere with your day. Sleep medication can worsen this problem by causing your cortisol to rise even more.

Magnesium glycinate before bed can help lower cortisol, which can help you sleep better at night. Twitching and cramping can signify a magnesium deficiency.

Low blood sugar can increase cortisol and cause you to wake up at night. If your diet is high in carbs, your blood sugar may decrease while sleeping, and your body will increase cortisol levels to normalize your blood sugar. If you’re waking up at 2 a.m., evaluate what you ate the day before.

Refined starches, MSG, alcohol, snacking, and eating late can disturb sleep.

Salt cravings can signify a sodium deficiency. Sodium helps lower cortisol, so add more sea salt to your meals throughout the day if you’re having salt cravings.

The liver detoxifies the body between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. Night waking during this time frame could signify a problem with the liver. Milk thistle before bed can help.

Restless legs syndrome can be related to a B1 or magnesium deficiency.

Lower your carb intake and increase your consumption of these nutrients. A high pulse rate could signify a potassium deficiency, which can also interfere with sleep.

Apple cider vinegar before bed can help stabilize blood sugar for better sleep, but make sure it’s diluted.

## How can I take supplements at night effectively without consuming excessive amounts of water?

To take supplements at night without consuming excessive water, consider breaking them into smaller doses and taking them with a minimal amount of a non-stimulatory food. Options include small amounts of celery, vegetables, or MCT oil. Fiber and fat are preferable choices as they have minimal impact on insulin levels compared to carbohydrates and proteins.

## How can I unclog my colon?

Digestion starts in the mouth, where food is broken down and then transferred to the stomach. The highly acidic stomach acid aids in protein digestion. The valve at the top of the stomach plays a vital role in keeping food in the stomach and preventing it from backing up into the esophagus. Many people think antacids are the solution to acid reflux or heartburn. Diluting stomach acid worsens this problem by inhibiting this valve from closing tightly.

If you have acid reflux, you want to increase the acidity of your stomach. Diluted apple cider vinegar and betaine hydrochloride are effective remedies for this problem. Ninety percent of all digestion occurs in the small intestine. This is also the location of a leaky gut. Grains, gluten, junk food, refined sugar, and seed oils can cause a leaky gut. The liver makes bile, which is stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. Bile helps break down fats, extract nutrients from fats, and kill pathogens. Bile deficiency symptoms include bloating, burping, vision problems, and gallstones. Bile salts such as TUDCA can help digestion by breaking down cholesterol.

Microbes break down food in the large intestine through fermentation. These microbes comprise 80% of your immune system and help make neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. After your food travels through this intricate assembly line, it becomes stool. Your stool is mostly water and gets its pigment from your red blood cells. The smell is caused by gas from bacteria. Constipation and diarrhea are usually related to missing microbes. Antibiotics and chemicals like glyphosate can deplete microbes. Fermented foods and the L. reuteri microbe are great ways to increase microbes and improve digestion naturally. Intermittent fasting can also significantly improve digestion.

## How can one effectively overcome addiction and implement strategies to prevent relapse for long-term recovery?

**Addiction to substances like nicotine, alcohol, and drugs can be incredibly difficult to overcome. These addictions harm our mental and physical health and deplete essential nutrients in the body, particularly NAD.**

**NAD is a crucial coenzyme involved in over 500 different chemical reactions in the body.** It plays a vital role in energy production, DNA repair, and maintaining proper cellular functioning. However, addiction to substances like nicotine, alcohol, and drugs can significantly deplete NAD levels in the body.

**Symptoms of NAD deficiency include fatigue, muscle soreness, weight gain, difficulty sleeping and concentrating, brain fog, and decreased stamina. These symptoms can make it even harder for someone to overcome an addiction.**

**WHAT TO DO**

To combat NAD deficiency, consider taking vitamin B3, also known as niacin. Niacin helps increase NAD levels in the body, improving energy, helping to reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings, and aiding in addiction recovery.

Some people may experience a flushing response on their skin when taking niacin, which can be uncomfortable. In this case, no-flush niacin can be used instead. In addition to supplementing with niacin, there are other ways to increase NAD levels in the body, such as intermittent fasting, following a healthy ketogenic diet, and regular exercise. These lifestyle changes can support addiction recovery and overall well-being. In some cases, clinics offer IV therapy for NAD to help with addiction recovery. However, this can be expensive and not accessible to everyone.

## How can one enhance the bioavailability of iron from dietary sources?

There are two types of iron: heme iron and non-heme iron. Heme iron comes from animal sources and non-heme iron comes from plant sources. Non-heme iron is not absorbed by the body as well as heme iron.

Consuming foods high in vitamin C alongside iron can help increase iron absorption. It’s best to consume foods with vitamin C, rather than synthetic forms of vitamin C like those found in vitamin C supplements. Some of the best sources of vitamin C are lemons, berries, and bell peppers.

Vitamin C is especially important if you’re getting your iron from plant sources. Avoid synthetic sources of iron like ferric oxide and ferric hydroxide.

## How can one ensure adequate potassium intake while following a carnivore diet, given its limited variety of food sources?

**You need 4700 mg of potassium each day, more than any other mineral.**

Potassium is important for the sodium-potassium pump present in all of your cells, which allows the contraction and relaxation of your nerves.

**Too much potassium is known as hyperkalemia, and too little is known as hypokalemia. Symptoms of high potassium include diarrhea, muscle pain, and muscle numbness. Symptoms of low potassium include constipation, muscle cramps, and fatigue.**

**Potassium is vital for exercise performance.** If you don’t have enough, you’ll probably feel weak or tired. One of the causes of low potassium is low magnesium.

**Kidney disease can cause high potassium.** If the kidney is not functioning properly, it won’t be able to get rid of potassium. It’s very rare to develop too much potassium in the blood from dietary intake.

**Blood pressure medications or side effects of an adrenal condition known as Addison's can also cause high potassium.** Diuretics and steroids can cause low potassium. Surgeries and injuries can also cause low potassium.

**The following vegetables are some of the best sources of potassium:**

•1 cup of beet leaves 1300 mg

•1 cup of Swiss chard 900 mg

•1 cup spinach 840 mg

•1 avocado 500-700 mg

•1 cup of beets 520 mg

•1 cup of salad 350-500 mg

Bananas contain around 300 mg of potassium but have too much sugar.

**Here are some of the best sources of potassium on the carnivore diet:**

## How do I integrate Epsom salt in my diet?

Epsom salt is a naturally occuring mineral salt that has some pretty good antimicrobial and antifungal properties. Overall it’s a very effective and beneficial substance.

**Benefits**

1. Antimicrobial
2. Antifungal
3. Especially good for toenail fungus
4. Epsom salt for toenail fungus

Dissolve two tablespoons of Epsom salt into four cups of water in a bucket. You can boil the water first, although you don’t have to. The main thing is to get the salt dissolved. Keep the water warm, but if you’ve boiled it first be sure to let it cool down to a comfortable temperature.

Soak your feet in this mixture daily for fifteen minutes. Do it for three to four weeks. You’ll see a great improvement. Also use a nail file to get rid of some of the dead toenail because the problem is that the fungus tends to get up underneath the nail and destroys it.

Depending on how infected the nail is, you may find that your dead nail has to come off and then regrow. Or if the infection isn’t too deep, new toenail tissue may just grow to replace the old.

## How do probiotics influence the management of fatty liver disease?

if you have a liver problem. This could include problems like a fatty liver, a liver that has inflammation, or cirrhosis. If your belly sticks out, you may have a fatty liver.

Probiotics can help prevent bacterial translocation. When there’s liver damage, the bacteria in your colon have the ability to migrate beyond the colon and into the lymphatic system. Once the bacteria get into the lymphatic system, you can have immune reactions, and you can trigger cytokines. This can cause inflammation, increase endotoxins, and increase TNF alpha.

Probiotics can also help reduce ammonia. One of the side effects of advanced liver problems is an excessive amount of ammonia in the blood. Probiotics may significantly reduce symptoms associated with liver disease. Probiotics may also help slow down fibrosis and reduce ammonia.

**How to get probiotics:**

• Take a good probiotic supplement

• Consume kombucha

• Consume sauerkraut

• Consume kimchi

• Consume kefir (plain and unsweetened)

## How do statins function in the management of cholesterol levels, and what are the potential side effects and risks associated with their long-term use?

**How Statins Work and Their Potential Side Effects**

Statins are medications that lower cholesterol by blocking an enzyme crucial for its production in the liver. However, cholesterol isn't just from your diet – your body makes it, too.

**Cholesterol, Bile Salts, and Health Risks**

Cholesterol is essential for producing bile salts, which help digest fats and absorb certain vitamins and omega-3s. Statins can disrupt this process. Low bile salt levels may increase the risk of gallstones and pancreatitis.

**Statin-Related Muscle Issues**

A common side effect of statins is myopathy, a general term for muscle disease. This can manifest as muscle weakness, wasting, lower back pain, and potentially even heart failure. Statins may also deplete CoQ10, an enzyme vital for muscle energy production.

**The Importance of CoQ10**

CoQ10 deficiency can worsen statin-related muscle issues. Supplementing with CoQ10 while taking statins might help reduce these side effects.

**Important Note:** Always consult your doctor before starting or stopping any medications or supplements.

## How does cholesterol influence muscle development and testosterone levels, and why is it important for these processes?

Your brain, nervous system, and muscles all need cholesterol to function. This is why cholesterol is important! Your body makes most of the cholesterol you need, about 3000 mg of cholesterol per day. Dietary cholesterol only accounts for 20-25 percent of your total cholesterol. Despite what you may have heard, consuming foods high in cholesterol does not increase your blood cholesterol levels.

Cholesterol is needed to make vitamin D and is also necessary in the production of bile, which helps to digest fats. Cholesterol and muscle building go hand in hand. Muscles require cholesterol to make them stronger and bigger. Cholesterol is a precursor for certain sex hormones and is anabolic in nature meaning that it builds things up. Without cholesterol, your body can not make testosterone.

When someone has high cholesterol, they are often prescribed statin drugs. Statins block the pathway to make cholesterol in the liver, shutting down the total production of cholesterol.

**Side effects of statin drugs include:**

•Myopathy—destruction of your muscle cells

•Myositis—an inflammatory condition of the muscles

•Muscle pain

•Back pain

•Weakness of the muscles

•Low coenzyme Q10 which is important for your heart

There’s also a black box warning because statins can cause diabetes and increase your risk for heart attacks, the exact problem they are supposed to prevent.

## How does exercise function as a natural antidepressant, and what evidence supports its effectiveness in improving mood and alleviating symptoms of depression?

### **Exercise as a Natural Antidepressant**

Finding yourself stuck in the grip of depression can be challenging. But did you know that exercise might help? Yes, moving your body isn't just good for physical health - it's like an antidepressant without a prescription.

#### **Exercise's Impact on Energy Levels and Stress**

Regular physical activity is proven to boost energy levels. When we move our bodies, blood circulation improves, bringing more oxygen and nutrients to our cells. This helps us feel more energetic.

Besides giving us an energy lift, exercise also plays a significant role in stress management. It prompts the release of endorphins - our body’s natural mood boosters. So, when life gets stressful (as it often does), getting active can provide some much-needed relief.

#### **Exercise for Better Sleep**

A consistent workout routine could lead to better sleep, too. Regular exercisers tend to fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep than those who remain inactive. And because good quality sleep is linked with improved mental well-being, this means less room for depressive thoughts.

## How does synthetic vitamin B12 compare to its natural counterparts in terms of efficacy and absorption?

Cyanocobalamin is a synthetic version of vitamin B12. It's a very cheap version, and it's hiding in many fortified grain foods, synthetic vitamins, energy drinks, B12 injections, and even infant formulas. It's also typically present in very high doses in these products. The problem is that there is a cyanide molecule attached to the cobalamin. Cyanide shuts down the oxygen to your mitochondria.

**Potential side effects of cyanocobalamin:**

• Vomiting

• Stomach problems

• Low potassium

• Headaches

• Fever

• Dizziness

The best form of vitamin B12 is the natural version called methylcobalamin. This version is the active form of vitamin B12 and stays in the body longer than the synthetic versions.

**Potential benefits of methylcobalamin:**

## How effective are anti-aging creams in reducing signs of aging, and what factors influence their efficacy in improving skin appearance?

Anti-aging creams are a multi-billion-dollar industry, but their efficacy may be limited. While these products can temporarily improve the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, and age spots by hydrating and plumping the skin, their effects are short-lived. Ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and glycerin help retain moisture, offering a smoother, more youthful look, but do not provide permanent solutions for reversing aging.However, once you stop using the cream, your skin will return to its original state. Some anti-aging creams, such as caffeine or retinol, contain ingredients that can temporarily tighten the skin.

These substances can help smooth out fine lines and wrinkles, but the effects are not permanent. Once you discontinue use of the product, your skin will eventually revert to its natural state.

***

## How long does magnesium usually stay in the body?

Certain minerals go through the body quickly, while other minerals don’t.

For example, minerals like sodium, iron, and calcium tend to be retained in the body. But, magnesium, potassium, and zinc are not held in the body for very long.

What determines the retention or recycling is how healthy the kidneys are. If your kidneys are very healthy, you may only lose a very small amount. But, if your kidneys are unhealthy, you could lose a lot more. There is a huge gap when it comes to how much magnesium your body will hold versus excrete.

The kidneys have the ability to get rid of excess magnesium, so it’s rarely toxic to the body. But, the body will get rid of .5-70% of magnesium within a 24 hour period. It’s very important to get plenty of magnesium.

The average American only consumes 200-300mg of magnesium per day. I believe a person should consume more like 500-600mg per day. Certain diseases, like diabetes, can cause the need for magnesium to go way up. This is because you likely aren’t retaining magnesium if you have blood sugar problems. Drinking a lot of alcohol can also severely decrease the ability to hold magnesium.

The number one symptom of a magnesium deficiency is fatigue. This is because the mitochondria (the energy factories of your cells) need magnesium to create the energy currency of the body. Palpitations and muscle weakness are a few more symptoms. If you crave chocolate, you may have a magnesium deficiency.

## How to do teeth whitening at home?

You don’t need to go to the dentist or purchase whitening strips for white teeth. Baking soda is nonabrasive and can be used to gently scrub your teeth to remove stains and plaque. You can combine baking soda with 3% hydrogen peroxide to whiten teeth at home. Combine 1 teaspoon of baking soda with 3 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide and 8 drops of water. This mixture breaks the bonds of tooth stains, leaving you with whiter teeth. It’s also beneficial for eliminating bacteria and reducing plaque formation.

Use a toothbrush to gently polish your teeth with this paste for 1 to 2 minutes. Rinse your mouth thoroughly when you’re finished. Do this 2 to 3 times per week for a few weeks for whiter teeth. Teeth whitening should be done gradually to avoid damaging the gums and tooth enamel. Oil pulling is an ancient practice that involves swishing oil in the mouth for 10 to 20 minutes. Coconut oil is great for oil pulling. It’s high in lauric acid, a potent anti-microbial that is effective against bacteria, fungus, and candida. It also helps with bad breath. Research has found oil pulling to be as effective as prescription mouthwash against gingivitis. Vitamin C and glucose compete in the body. Bleeding gums are often caused by low vitamin C. If you consume a lot of sugar, glucose will block your vitamin C, which will show up in your gums.

## How to end dry cough fast?

Most dry cough remedies involve medication that suppresses the cough. However, suppressing the cough is not always best because coughing is one of the body’s vital defense mechanisms. A cough can result from a post-nasal drip caused by an allergy, cold, virus, or fungal infection. It can also be a side effect of certain medications or be related to GERD or asthma.

Many children have asthma because their mothers did not get enough vitamin D during pregnancy. Vitamin D is essential for lung formation. If a cough is caused by croup, vitamin D is also an excellent home remedy. Some coughs are caused by low humidity. In this case, try a humidifier.

Laryngospasms can also cause a dry cough. These spasms are often caused by low calcium in the blood. A deficiency in vitamin D3 can cause low blood calcium. Take 20,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily if you’re dealing with a cough related to laryngospasms. Always take magnesium and vitamin K2 with vitamin D3. Chronic dry cough can also be caused by perfumes, smoke, new furniture, or tic disorders.

NAC (n-acetyl-cysteine) is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory that breaks up mucus in the lungs. To use NAC for a cough, dissolve ¼ teaspoon of NAC powder into 4 ounces of water. Once dissolved, add ⅛ teaspoon of magnesium in the form of Epsom salt. Add this liquid to a nebulizer and breathe in for 5 minutes, 1 to 2 times daily.

• Be sure to use food-grade Epsom salt.

• Make sure the NAC and Epsom salt are fully dissolved before nebulizing.

• Use sterile or distilled water to prevent contamination.

• Consult a healthcare professional before nebulizing any homemade solution.

Black seed oil and white horehound are also good home remedies for a cough if taken with vitamin D3, K2, magnesium, and zinc.

## How to get rid of mucus fast?

NAC works similarly to salt by thinning mucus, but it also stops its production. It’s a potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral agent that can even break up biofilms. NAC also strengthens the cilia in the respiratory system, which helps to move mucus.

NAC can be taken orally, injected, or inhaled through a nebulizer. It can be beneficial for respiratory congestion related to an infection or for diseases like COPD or cystic fibrosis. NAC is also used in hospitals as an antidote for Tylenol poisoning. NAC helps enhance brain function and may be beneficial for people with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson's, OCD, addictions, depression, and schizophrenia. NAC can improve insulin sensitivity, which helps regulate blood sugar and prevent a fatty liver. It promotes healthy blood pressure and cholesterol, and can even help with asthma.

You can reduce respiratory mucus with salt if you’re dealing with an acute infection, but NAC can eliminate mucus and the inflammation behind it. Vitamin C, curcumin, probiotics, magnesium, quercetin, and vitamin D can all improve the effectiveness of NAC.

## How to get rid of sebaceous filaments?

Many people mistake sebaceous filaments for blackheads and try to remove them by using tweezers or other methods. However, this can damage the skin. The presence of sebaceous filaments and blackheads is often linked to the overproduction of sebum. This production is regulated by a hormone called androgens, which can increase during puberty, pregnancy, or other hormonal imbalances. So, how do we address the root cause of sebaceous filaments? One way is to regulate and balance our androgen levels through dietary changes. Consuming foods high in vitamin A, D, and omega-3 fatty acids while reducing the intake of seed oils found in processed foods can help decrease sebum production. Another way to reduce and balance androgen levels is through intermittent fasting and the keto diet, which helps lower insulin levels. High levels of insulin can also contribute to the overproduction of sebum. Additionally, zinc deficiency has been linked to raised sebum production. Consuming zinc-rich foods such as shellfish and red meat can help address this deficiency. Managing stress levels is also essential, as chronic stress can deplete our zinc levels.

## How to stop frequent night time urination?

Frequent urination is often blamed on an enlarged prostate, UTIs, or kidney stones, but there’s a much more common root cause.

The most common cause of frequent urination at night is too much insulin in your blood. Insulin resistance is a condition where your insulin receptors no longer accept insulin. To compensate, the pancreas produces more insulin. This is why many diabetics have a problem with urinary frequency at night.

When blood sugar is high, the kidneys remove the sugar from the blood to eliminate it from the body. This increases urination frequency. Insulin resistance causes an overactive bladder, even if your blood sugar is normal. Increased urinary frequency at night is an early sign of insulin resistance, which is a precursor to diabetes. Insulin resistance increases stress on the kidneys, which is why diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease. Insulin resistance can also cause electrolyte imbalances, blood pressure changes at night, and increased cortisol.

Snacking at night is the single most significant cause of frequent urination at night. Eliminate all snacks and beverages after dinner to decrease urination frequency at night. Snacking at night can also cause bloating and interrupted sleep.

A low-salt diet can also increase urination frequency at night. If you think your nocturia is due to low salt, add more sea salt to your meals throughout the day.

A low-carb diet can help reduce nocturia symptoms. Keep your carb consumption under 30 grams per day. Healthy Keto® can combat insulin resistance, improve your health, and reduce frequent urination at night.

Intermittent fasting is equally important in reversing insulin resistance. Aim for 3 meals with no snacks, eventually dropping down to 2 meals each day. Ending nocturia will significantly enhance your sleep, which is vital for your heart, blood sugar, stress levels, energy, cognitive function, and more. Don’t forget to get plenty of vitamin D with magnesium.

## How to thicken my hair?

The good bacteria in your gut make biotin. This is why a common side effect of antibiotics is hair problems. When you stop taking biotin, you may notice that the problem comes right back, so it’s vital to address gut health when dealing with biotin deficiency. Liver and egg yolks are the best sources of biotin. Nutritional yeast and salmon also contain biotin. Alcohol, raw eggs, and magnesium deficiency can interfere with biotin absorption. Zinc and copper are essential for biotin absorption and function.

Retinol, the active form of vitamin A, is only found in animal foods. Liver and egg yolks are the best sources, but you can also find vitamin A in shellfish and cod liver oil. Vitamin A helps control sebum, so it’s very beneficial for thick, shiny hair! For healthy hair, reduce your omega-6 fat intake and increase your omega-3s. Omega-3 fatty acids are vital for healthy hair. Fish oil and cod liver oil are excellent sources of omega-3s.

L. reuteri is a microbe missing in 96% of the population. It increases sebum, which makes hair shiny, and it may also increase hair growth. Copper is used in many different enzymes, including the enzyme that helps prevent iron accumulation in your tissues. Iron is vital for hair growth, but we need the right balance. NPK fertilizer in our foods is a common cause of copper deficiency. If the grass is deficient in copper, the animals that eat the grass will also be deficient. Animals with copper deficiency have very dull hair. If this can happen to sheep and cows, it can definitely happen to us! Overconsumption of iron, often from fortified wheat products, can lock up your copper and contribute to copper deficiency. Other contributors to copper deficiency include high fructose corn syrup and high zinc intake.

**If you want healthy hair, add the following foods to your diet:**

•Fermented foods (i.e. kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi)

•Liver

•Egg yolks

•Cod liver oil/cod liver

•Organic foods

•Trace minerals

## I Might Get Banned for This...

The current recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is a mere 600 IU (international units), a surprisingly small amount considering its vast potential health benefits. This has sparked controversy, likely due to the numerous conditions vitamin D may positively impact.

In the early 1900s, before modern medicine, heliotherapy (sunbathing) was used to treat a wide range of ailments, including tuberculosis, asthma, osteoporosis, tooth decay, psoriasis, mood disorders, diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer.

A nine-year study conducted by the University of Illinois Chicago, commissioned by the government, involving hundreds of doctors, patients, and even dogs, found no toxicity even at extremely high doses of vitamin D (200,000-1,000,000 IU).

Despite this, Dr. Bruce Hollis, a leading vitamin D researcher, notes that many in the field are hesitant to embrace the extensive data supporting its benefits.

Interestingly, data shows that populations living closer to the equator, with higher sun exposure and thus greater vitamin D levels, have lower rates of multiple sclerosis, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and diabetes.

Factors like vitamin D resistance, age, darker skin, and higher body weight can increase your vitamin D needs. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the optimal dosage for your individual circumstances.

## In addition to taking minerals for arthritis, are there other important treatments or strategies that I should consider incorporating into my management plan?

**The Role of Boron in Arthritis Management**

Boron is a crucial trace mineral that supports the effectiveness of calcium and magnesium in arthritis treatment. It helps retain these minerals in the bone, activates vitamin D, and reduces joint inflammation by lowering C-reactive protein levels. Boron deficiency may lead to excess calcium and magnesium in the urine, calcification of soft tissues, and weakened bones.

Benefits of boron include:

\- Enhancing mineral retention in bones

\- Activating vitamin D

\- Preventing tooth decay

A lack of boron can also cause receding gums, kidney stones, and calcification in arteries and joints. Additionally, adequate boron levels support hormonal balance and may reduce the risk of prostate cancer.

For arthritis relief, starting with 3 mg of boron three times daily may be beneficial. Consult with a healthcare provider to tailor this approach to your needs.

## Is a daily dose of 500 milligrams of a magnesium blend supplement considered excessive, and what are the potential risks or benefits of this dosage?

No, It's not too much. Just make sure also that you're taking the other minerals too, because they all work together, especially with potassium, magnesium, calcium, magnesium, but I wouldn't take any calcium.You can normally get that from the diet. So I think also vitamin D is important with magnesium. They both need each other for, for optimum function.

## Is a plant-based meat diet beneficial for overall health, and what are the potential advantages and drawbacks of incorporating plant-based meat alternatives into your diet?

**Plant-based meat is marketed as clean meat. People are gravitating to these fake meats because of claims that real meat causes cancer and other chronic diseases.**

The studies that were used to draw these conclusions were food questionnaires and observational studies. Out of 800 studies on the topic, researchers claiming that meat was bad only focused on 17.

An evaluation of the studies linking red meat to cancer by the Annals of Internal Medicine concluded that the evidence linking red meat consumption to cancer and cardiovascular disease is too weak to recommend that we eat less of it.

New guidelines say we don't need to change our meat habits. No significant link between meat consumption and heart disease, diabetes, or cancer has been found.

**Plant-based meat is full of ultra-processed ingredients like seed oils, soy, modified food starches, and GMO ingredients. Claims that plant-based meat is identical to real meat are completely false. Metabolomic studies have shown key differences in 171 out of 190 compounds in fake meat compared to real meat.**

## Is adopting a low-sodium dietary regimen advantageous for overall health, particularly in managing hypertension and reducing cardiovascular risk?

There is very little attention to raising potassium, which is really what causes high blood pressure. And low salt diets, as well as low potassium diets, can raise your cholesterol. Even salt-sensitive people are really potassium deficient. So start consuming at least 7 cups of vegetables each day to increase your potassium.

## Is apple cider vinegar effective against blood sugar problems?

If you have blood sugar issues, adding apple cider vinegar (ACV) to your diet can be highly beneficial. The acetic acid in ACV provides a potent anti-glycemic effect, helping to lower the glycemic index of the foods you eat. This can stabilize blood sugar and insulin levels, leading to reduced insulin production. Lower insulin levels can help decrease liver fat, promote weight loss, and reduce hunger and cravings.

## Is ashwagandha the same as American ginseng, or are there distinct differences between these two herbal supplements in terms of their properties and uses?

**It's not the same. But it's, they both are adaptogens, and what those adaptogens do is they help strengthen the part of the autonomic nervous system, whether it's one side or the other, dominant.**

**So they just strengthen the autonomic nervous system, allowing you to cope with stress a lot more. And I did release a video relating to this, it's called Heart Rate Variability Technology, HRV, and so there is a device that you can get to measure both the sympathetic and parasympathetic.**

But there's a, it's a fascinating tool to be able to identify, first of all, your stress dates, and then also try out different adaptogens to see what creates the most change on your autonomic nervous system. You can go by symptoms, but it's nice to kind of see objectively what's happening with your parasympathetics, in relationship to stress and exercise.

You have to really be creative and kind of think of all sorts of things. But as a side note, the hormone that seems to be one of the best things to reduce cortisol is oxytocin. And oxytocin can be stimulated by bonding your baby, or an animal, or taking care of animals, or donating.

## Is autophagy safe for someone with cancer?

Autophagy plays a complex role in cancer, acting as a double-edged sword. On one hand, autophagy can protect against disease by removing harmful pathogens and damaged cell parts, acting as a cellular bodyguard. This process is beneficial in preventing the onset of cancer by maintaining cellular health and integrity.

However, once cancer is present, the scenario changes. Autophagy can also aid cancer cells in surviving under stress by providing them a sort of "secret hideout" during their battle against the body's defense mechanisms. This means that while autophagy is generally a protective and beneficial process, it can inadvertently support the progression and survival of existing cancer cells under certain conditions.

Research is examining this paradoxical role of autophagy in cancer, with studies exploring how altering autophagy levels might influence cancer treatment. For example, some drugs traditionally used for other conditions, like hydroxychloroquine, are being investigated for their potential to interfere with this survival mechanism of cancer cells by inhibiting autophagy.

Given this complex relationship between autophagy and cancer, whether autophagy is safe or beneficial for someone with cancer depends on various factors, including the type and stage of cancer, overall health, and specific treatment plans. Individuals with cancer must consult with their healthcare providers before making any changes to their lifestyle or treatment plan that could affect autophagy. Healthcare professionals can provide personalized advice based on the latest research and the individual's circumstances.

## Is baking soda effective for handling a heartburn?

Maintaining an acidic environment in the stomach is essential for optimal health. While baking soda is highly alkaline and can provide temporary relief, it does not address the underlying issue. In fact, the use of baking soda may exacerbate the problem over time by neutralizing stomach acid without replenishing it. This can lead to a worsening of the condition as the stomach's acidity is crucial for digestion and overall gastrointestinal function.

## Is black seed oil the only beneficial seed oil, or are there other seed oils with notable health benefits?

You know, there are some other, other seed oils, black currant seed oil, borage oil, things like that. But typically the problem with seeds is we're not really meant to consume a lot of oil from seeds or seeds themselves. Seeds have gotten us into trouble.

If you think about 50% at least to the US and UK diet is seed based. Corn is a seed, soy is a seed. And so you've got wheat as a seed. So you've got all these seeds. And of course they're highly processed.And then you've got all the cottonseed, canola oils. We create all this processed food. And then on top of that, these monocrops basically are fed to the animals that we eat. So we're getting a lot of seeds. So I would hold off from the seeds for a while. You know, black seed oil is an exception.

## Is calcium important for the heart?

Maintaining calcium balance is crucial for heart health. Medications for various heart conditions, particularly arrhythmia, often target calcium levels by either reducing excess calcium or indirectly controlling it through increased magnesium levels. This highlights the importance of magnesium in maintaining healthy calcium balance, crucial for preventing and addressing heart problems.

* **Calcium balance is crucial for heart health**: Calcium plays a vital role in heart muscle contraction. However, too much or too little calcium can disrupt the heart's electrical signals, leading to arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and other heart problems.
* **Medications target calcium levels**: Many heart medications, especially those for arrhythmias, work by influencing calcium levels. Some directly reduce calcium influx into heart cells, while others indirectly control it by affecting other ions like magnesium.
* **Magnesium's role**: Magnesium is important for maintaining calcium balance. It helps regulate calcium channels in cells, influencing how much calcium enters and leaves.

In conclusion, maintaining the right balance of calcium is essential for a healthy heart.

**Important Note:** It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for any specific questions or concerns regarding heart health, medications, and mineral balance.

***

## Is calcium supplementation considered an essential component in the management and prevention of osteoporosis and osteopenia?

**Calcium supplementation carries risks, especially for those with osteoporosis or osteopenia.** While calcium is essential for bone health, research suggests excess calcium intake (especially from supplements) can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. One notable study found that people taking over 1400 mg of calcium daily had a significantly higher risk of heart attack. Additionally, calcification in arteries is a common issue, and excess calcium does not automatically strengthen bones.

The body maintains a delicate calcium balance. Too much intracellular calcium can lead to cell death. This highlights the importance of regulating calcium levels rather than simply increasing intake.

**Vitamin C** may offer a safer alternative for supporting bone health. Studies suggest that higher doses of vitamin C (at least 6000 mg daily) could improve bone density. Vitamin C may help suppress osteoclasts (cells that break down bone) and promote calcium absorption into bones.

## Is cayenne pepper more effective than baby aspirin for thinning the blood, and if so, what is the recommended daily dosage for cayenne pepper?

**You know, everyone is told that baby aspirin is everyone needs to do it because it's normal. And recently there's some data that says that not everyone should do it. And it comes with the package. So my whole viewpoint is that if you do your research and you find that there are problems with aspirin, then you're looking for alternatives. You might want to try other things that could potentially help you.**

Cayenne pepper, different peppers, different remedies, different phytonutrients in certain plant compounds. Willow bark. You also have stinging nettle root.

There's so many different things you can take. So I would just research several of them to see if any of them can actually come close to creating the effect that you want to do without the side effects. All right.

## Is colon cleansing advantageous for health?

There are several different types of colon cleansing:

**• Colon hydrotherapy**

This is where water goes up the rectum into the large intestine and flushes everything out. This can flush out you’re electrolytes. You may want to take electrolytes after, so you don’t become deficient. You’re also flushing out your friendly bacteria, which would need to be put back in.

**• Herbal laxatives**

Creates a purging of the material out of the colon

**• Colema**

This is a combination of an enema and a colonic. The problem is that it’s very temporary. It also flushes out your electrolytes. If you’re already deficient in electrolytes, this can cause dizziness and even affect your heart. The apple juice a person is supposed to drink while doing the colema, can also keep the blood sugars up, preventing ketosis.

Fixing your diet (doing keto) may be the best way to go. Typically, fixing the diet can fix whatever issue caused you to want to do the colon cleansing to begin with. I’m not against colon hydrotherapy as a short-term solution for constipation or other conditions. But, it should be supervised, and the electrolytes and friendly bacteria need to be put back in.

**What you can do:**

1\. Start fasting

2\. Decrease inflammation

3\. Consume phytonutrients

4\. Consume fermented vegetables

## Is creatine an effective supplement for weight training?

Creatine is a combination of three amino acids. These are arginine, glycine and methionine. In your muscles, creatine combines with phosphate to help you recycle ATP (the energy currency in the muscles). It helps you to recover energy and assists with muscle development.

**Benefits**

* Can help you tolerate heavy weight training
* Can help with the recovery of the muscle
* Can help with the strength of muscles
* Can help the size of the muscle

**How to consume it**

There are different types of creatine. Some people can actually be allergic to creatine as well. You may want to try a small amount first, to make sure you’re not allergic to it.

There are two versions of creatine that Dr. Berg recommends as better than others:

* Creatine ethyl ester
* Micronized creatine

Follow the manufacturer instructions for the right dosages.

**Where to get it**

You can get it at a health food or nutrition store, or order it online.

## Is erythritol a healthy alternative sweetener for your body?

A new study on erythritol and heart attacks has been in the news and found its way to social media—let’s talk about it. This study correlates erythritol in your blood to higher incidents of heart attacks and strokes. However, I see some serious problems with this study.

**Here are four key points about this study:**

1\. Correlation does not mean causation.

2\. This study was based on endogenous erythritol and did not measure dietary erythritol. The body makes endogenous erythritol.

3\. The body produces erythritol when you metabolize sugar, have oxidative stress or belly fat, or consume alcohol. The great majority of people in this study were in poor health, so how do we know erythritol was the problem?

4\. Other research has linked erythritol to many different health benefits. Could it be that erythritol is increasing in the body to counter the bad effects of sugar? It seems to me that erythritol is something that’s trying to help you and not hurt you.

***

## Is excessive vitamin D intake linked to hair loss, and what mechanisms might contribute to this adverse effect in individuals with high vitamin D levels?

Yes. Vitamin D increases the intestinal absorption of calcium, and elevated vitamin D levels can result in excessive calcium, also known as hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can cause soft tissue calcification and lead to calcified plaque formation on the scalp, which blocks hair follicles and results in hair loss.

***

## Is gallbladder olive oil flush effective?

A gallbladder flush with olive oil is intended to remove gallstones but typically only expels bile salts. Ironically, reducing bile can increase the risk of gallstones. Gallstones form when there is a high concentration of cholesterol and low bile levels. Bile is crucial for absorbing fat-soluble vitamins and fatty acids. A high-carb diet reduces bile release, while a high-fat diet does not cause gallstones if sufficient bile is produced. Fat triggers bile release, preventing stone formation, not causing it.

## Is it advisable to consume celery juice on a daily basis?

**Celery Juice: More Than Just Water**

While celery is mostly water, it packs a punch with potent phytonutrients. Here's the breakdown:

* **Beyond Vitamins:** Yes, celery juice has folate and sodium. But the real stars are:

1. **3-n-butylphthalide (3nB):** This powerhouse helps repair stroke damage, promotes healthy blood flow, and may even regenerate brain cells. Plus, it's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and more!
2. **Apigenin:** This well-researched compound, also found in herbs and citrus, relaxes muscles, lowers blood pressure, aids sleep, fights diabetes, AND might help with memory loss.
3. **Coumaric Acid:** Reduces inflammation and ulcers, stabilizes blood sugar, and might ease arthritis pain.
4. **Kaempferol:** A natural defender against viruses, bacteria, and inflammation.

**Best Way to Enjoy:**

* **Morning Boost:** Drink celery juice on an empty stomach for maximum benefits.
* **Go Organic:** Choose organic celery to minimize pesticide exposure.
* **Flavor Kick:** Squeeze in some lemon for a refreshing taste.

## Is it advisable to include olive oil in my diet, and what are the specific health benefits associated with its consumption?

**Olive oil is rich in antioxidants and has anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. Olive oil also has incredible effects on certain parts of the body, including:**

• The cardiovascular system

• The nerves and brain

• The skin

• The eyes

Olive oil is a good source of healthy fats and contains vitamins E and K1. However, the real benefits of olive oil occur because of a group of plant chemicals called polyphenols. Polyphenols produce many amazing effects on the body, like helping to prevent complications from chronic disease and oxidative stress. **It’s crucial to get real olive oil that’s organic.** This is because glyphosate (an herbicide) blocks a plant’s ability to produce amino acids and polyphenols. Glyphosate can also lead to a myriad of other health concerns.

Keep in mind that salads contain polyphenols and other phytonutrients. Plus, adding olive oil to salads helps increase the absorption of phytonutrients.

***

## Is it advisable to take niacin and TUDCA together, and what are the potential benefits or interactions between these two supplements?

Niacin and TUDCA should only be taken together if there is a specific concern. TUDCA, a bile salt containing choline, aids digestion and breaks down cholesterol. If you follow a healthy ketogenic diet with low carbs and intermittent fasting, you typically don't need to worry about cholesterol. Issues arise when the diet is not followed strictly, or if carbohydrates are still being consumed.

## Is it advisable to utilize acupressure techniques following a head injury or concussion, considering potential complications and individual health conditions?

Try this simple, effective acupressure technique for head injury relief today!

This can even work for pain from an old head injury!

Your skull is composed of plates that join together along joints called sutures. Head tension can build up along these sutures long after a head injury has taken place. These simple techniques can help minimize the pain associated with new and old head injuries alike.

You’re going to need someone to help you do this, so have them watch this video as well. For a general head injury, place your thumb firmly on the back of the head and gently apply pressure. Hold the forehead to stabilize the head, and continue pressing upwards.

If you have an injury on the side of your head, you’ll want to press towards the injury from different angles. You can also push on the area where the injury was, but on the opposite side of the skull.

Similarly, if the head injury is on the top of the head, you’ll also want to press upwards toward the injury.

This acupressure technique can provide a tremendous amount of relief for both old head injury pain and pain from newer head injuries. Relieving this pain can help you get better sleep, reduce stress, and will help you feel calmer overall.

## Is it feasible to enhance endogenous hyaluronic acid production within the body through dietary, pharmacological, or lifestyle interventions?

You have probably seen ads for creams and injections intended to restore hyaluronic acid. Some clinics specialize in these types of cosmetic procedures.

Many people topically apply creams or take hyaluronic acid orally. Let's address whether it can be absorbed and offer hyaluronic acid benefits if taken orally.

Though some claim you can't absorb oral hyaluronic acid, this isn't true. You might not absorb much, more like 2.5%. However, even that small percentage can be just enough to help replace what you are naturally losing as you get older.

There was once a show hosted by Connie Chung focusing entirely on this topic. During the segment, she interviewed many centenarians in a Japanese village who were still very active and working.

The villagers credited their longevity and hyaluronic acid benefits to a special type of root they consumed regularly, one that was incredibly high in this youth-promoting substance. Foods high in hyaluronic acid can provide an extra boost.

***

## Is it more beneficial to take full-flush niacin in the morning or evening, and what are the considerations for timing in relation to its effects and side effects?

The timing of taking full-flush niacin is flexible as it's water-soluble and can be taken on an empty stomach. However, if the flushing response is disruptive, it might be better to avoid taking it right before bed. Overall, the timing of niacin intake is not crucial.

## Is it possible to effectively detoxify the body through the skin, and what biological processes facilitate the elimination of toxins via this method?

While the skin can eliminate certain toxins via sweat, the liver and kidneys process and remove the majority of toxins via the stool and urine. However, promoting healthy skin function in combination with activities such as saunas or hot baths can support skin-related detoxification processes.

***

## Is it possible to experience pain or discomfort during a liver cleanse, and what are the potential causes and considerations for managing such symptoms?

Yes, pain can be associated with a liver cleanse due to the release of toxins, which can trigger inflammation and immune reactions, often manifesting as lower back pain. To mitigate this, consider taking bentonite clay or activated charcoal to absorb the toxins. If pain persists, increase your intake of vitamin D3 to 20,000 IU, which can be effective in alleviating discomfort.

2\. Excess aromatase that destroys the fibroblasts that make collagen under the skin.

How to get rid of cellulite:

**1. Fix the atrophy problem**

• Do lunges

• Do squats

• Start retro walking

• Try sprinting

**2. Fix the circulation problem**

• Do rebound exercises

## Is it possible to overtake supplements, and if so, what are the potential risks and dangers associated with excessive supplementation?

Yes, it is indeed possible to overconsume supplements, which can potentially pose risks, particularly with synthetic options. While immediate dangers might not always be evident, excessive intake can lead to imbalanced nutrient levels and increased costs. Generally, food-based supplements are considered safer; however, maintaining a balanced diet and using supplements to address specific deficiencies remains essential.

Assessing the impact of individual supplements on your overall health and adjusting your regimen as needed is crucial. For instance, while trace minerals might not yield immediate noticeable effects, they play a significant role in long-term health benefits, including DNA repair and longevity.

## Is it possible to reduce the size of a cancer tumor, and what treatments or strategies are most effective in achieving tumor shrinkage?

Dr. Berg Nutritionals cannot diagnose, treat, or cure any disease, including cancer. Any information provided is for informational purposes and does not replace medical treatment plans. Based on this understanding, here are steps that can be inferred to potentially help in reducing the size of a cancer tumor or support overall cancer treatment:

1. **Dietary Adjustments**:
   * Limit glucose (sugar) consumption: The link between food intake, especially glucose consumption, and cancer risk is significant. Reducing glucose intake can potentially slow down the growth of cancer cells, as they often rely on sugar for energy. The Healthy Keto diet is a great way to reduce glucose.
2. **Fasting**:
   * Implement fasting protocols: Fasting is a strategic approach that can weaken cancer cells. When you fast, your healthy cells become more resilient, while cancer cells may lose their competitive edge. This can potentially make the body less hospitable to cancer growth.
3. **Exercise**:
   * Regular physical activity: Integrating exercise into your routine can promote cellular repair and improve overall health. Exercise has been shown to support the body's ability to fight off cancer by strengthening the immune system and potentially inhibiting tumor growth.
4. **Reducing Inflammation**:
   * Adopt anti-inflammatory practices: Since cancer can spread into areas of inflammation, reducing inflammation in the body may help slow down or prevent the spreading of cancer cells. This can be achieved through dietary choices, lifestyle changes, and possibly supplements that have anti-inflammatory properties, such as vitamin D and turmeric.
5. **Stress Management and Social Connections**:
   * Manage stress and foster social connections: Chronic stress and loneliness can weaken the immune system and make the body more susceptible to cancer. By managing stress through techniques such as meditation, yoga, or therapy and by seeking out social connections and community support, you can strengthen your body's defenses against cancer.

**It's important to note that these steps should be considered supportive or complementary strategies in a comprehensive cancer treatment plan developed by healthcare professionals. Always consult with your doctor or a medical professional before making significant changes to your lifestyle, diet, or exercise routine, especially when dealing with cancer.**

## Is it possible to regulate blood sugar levels without consuming sugar?

When you are eating sugars and carbs often, your body and brain use glucose as it's main form of energy. But the body can also convert foods into ketones, which serve as an excellent source of energy for both the brain and body. If you want to control your blood sugar levels without eating sugar, try switching to a low-carb diet like Healthy Keto® as this will reduce insulin spikes while also ensuring you have plenty of energy.

## Is it possible to remedy the liver cirrhosis caused by high insulin?

If you have high insulin in your body this can cause inflammation and a fatty liver. Inflammation can cause damage to your liver and your body will attempt to heal it, creating scar tissue in your liver. This will result in cirrhosis. Insulin goes too high mainly due to consuming a lot of refined carbs and sugar and due to frequent eating over a long period of time.

**Remedies:**

* Avoid refined carbs and sugar
* Avoid snacking
* Do the Healthy Keto® diet
* Do an intermittent fasting plan
* Do periodic prolonged fasting
* Consume more potassium

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Is it possible to reverse diabetes through the implementation of a healthy diet, and what specific dietary changes or nutritional strategies have shown the most promise in achieving this outcome?

Yes, it’s possible to reverse diabetes with a nutritious, low-carb diet. Restricting carbohydrates helps promote balanced blood sugar levels and enhances insulin sensitivity, two crucial factors in restoring the body’s ability to regulate blood glucose and reverse diabetes.

***

## Is it recommended to take copper?

Copper is a very important trace mineral (minerals that are needed in small amounts) that has to do with normal functioning of your brain and nervous system. It is also important for other functions and parts of your body.

Copper is good in the right amounts. You don’t want to have too much of it, as it has some toxic effects on you. You should know that when you increase copper, you severely decrease zinc, and you can create an imbalance. Estrogen also would increase copper in the body, and copper itself can stop the liver from removing excess amounts of estrogen.

**Benefits:**

* Has powerful effects on brain function
* Involved in making neurotransmitters
* Anti-inflammatory
* Antimicrobial
* Supports the Immune system
* Helps with vitiligo (for it, use copper cream directly on the skin)
* Important for collagen
* Supports melanin
* Can immobilize sperm
* Can decrease iron
* Can increase estrogen
* Impacts the vaginal microbiome (the bacteria that regulate estrogen)

## Is it safe to use a gallbladder cleanse?

A gallbladder cleanse is not advisable if you have potential gallstones. Gallstones are often caused by a bile deficiency. Since 90% of bile is recycled, a gallbladder flush can deplete your bile reserves, increasing the risk of stone formation. It can take a long time to restore bile levels, further raising the risk of complications.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

Kefir made from raw milk is a highly effective probiotic for addressing opportunistic bacteria and leaky gut due to its diverse range of beneficial yeast and bacteria. For optimal results, consider making kefir yourself using a starter kit. If kefir isn't suitable, other excellent options include kimchi, sauerkraut, and spore-based probiotics.

***

## Is kombucha considered healthy, and what are its potential benefits and risks for overall well-being?

You got to be careful about kombucha because a while ago you could find it with two grams of sugar. But nowadays you read the label what's 12 grams of sugar, 16 grams of sugar. That's a lot of sugar because they make it out of sugar and they make it out of sugar and black tea. So I think the acids in there do help the digestive system.

There's some better digestive fermented products. Things like kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi. But let's say for example, you have someone of a craving for alcohol, kombucha tea is a good alternative because it gives you the texture, it gives you the calmness, and it's kind of like a carbonated beverage that you can pretend like you're drinking a beer and create similar effects.

***

## Is L-leucine plant sourced?

L-leucine in this product is listed as an excipient (an inactive ingredient). It is a vegan-sourced L-leucine, which means it is typically produced through a fermentation process using plants like corn or sugar beets. As an inactive ingredient, L-leucine acts as a flow agent to help prevent the powder from clumping together and to ensure the mixture flows smoothly during the manufacturing process. This helps the manufacturer fill each capsule or tablet consistently and maintain the product’s quality and uniformity.

## Is lemon juice characterized by an acidic or alkaline pH, and how does its acidity influence its effects on the body?

Citric acid is a very strong acid in lemons. Lemon juice is very acidic. But, as soon as you consume it, it gets burned up in the body and turns alkaline. Lemon juice won't alkalize the blood or body, but it will alkalize the urine.

**Benefits of lemon juice:**

• Could help reduce the risk of gout

• Could potentially reduce uric acid stones and calcium oxalate stones

• Raw lemon juice is a good source of vitamin C Lemon juice is acid, but it turns into an alkaline compound about an hour after it's consumed.

***

## Is liver and gallbladder cleanse effective?

Bile, produced by the liver, is essential for extracting fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K1, K2) and preventing constipation. Liver damage, such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, or fatty liver, significantly impairs bile production and detoxification, causing toxin buildup.

Most liver and gallbladder cleanses are short-term solutions and do not address the underlying issues. The liver requires up to three years to regenerate fully. Effective long-term solutions involve dietary improvements and sustained lifestyle changes.

## Is oregano effective for supporting the immune system?

The most potent natural antibiotic—oregano essential oil. One of the big problems nowadays in healthcare is something called antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance is where the body starts resisting antibiotics, and the body needs stronger amounts to create the effect it needs.

Oregano has incredible antibacterial, anti-fungal, and antimicrobial properties. I recommend oregano in the form of oregano essential oil. The active compound of oregano is called Thymol.

There are several studies that show oregano is almost comparable to antibiotics for E.coli, Pseudomonas, STAPH, and other infections. It also has no side effects. Follow the directions on the label of the oregano oil you choose, and start with a small dose working your way up to more.

Taking this along with garlic may also increase effectiveness.

## Is static stretching beneficial for muscle health and performance?

Static stretching can sometimes activate the stretch reflex, which may counteract the intended benefits by causing the muscle to tighten. A more effective approach is to use an isolated contraction technique: contract the opposing muscle while stretching the target muscle. For instance, contract the quadriceps while stretching the hamstrings. Hold the stretch at the end range of motion for two seconds, then release. Repeat this process eight to ten times. This method can enhance flexibility more effectively than static stretching alone.

**Where to get it**

You can get it at any ordinary grocery store.

***

## Is the baking soda safe to consume?

**The stomach should be extremely acid with a pH between 1-3. This is normal.** You need your stomach acids to be at that pH to digest proteins, kill microbes, and absorb minerals. When food goes through the stomach and then into the small intestine, the pancreas releases bicarbonate. Our bodies are supposed to have bicarbonate in the small intestine, not the stomach, to neutralize the stomach acid so it doesn’t damage the small intestine. Bicarbonates are alkaline. Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. If you’re putting baking soda into your stomach, you’re going to mess up your digestion down the road.

Taking apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride can help increase stomach acid and potentially help with acid reflux. A combination of betaine hydrochloride and zinc carnosine may also be effective.

## Is the consumption of carbonated water beneficial for health, or are there potential drawbacks to consider?

The body needs CO2 for oxygen to be absorbed into the cells. You can even put your body in a hypoxic state (low oxygen state) by depriving your tissues of CO2. Carbonated spas or baths are used in some places for people with circulatory problems or diabetic wounds. It’s also used as a therapy for people after a stroke and to decrease the rate of amputation.

While I wasn’t able to find research on the health benefits of carbonated water, I did find some parallel research on CO2. CO2 is a potent anti-tumor, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory gas. One study found a significant increase in the activation of the parasympathetic nervous system by increasing CO2. The parasympathetic nervous system counters fight or flight mode and supports healing, digestion, and sleep.

CO2 is a key factor we can’t ignore. You can increase your CO2 by breathing through your nose, especially while you sleep or exercise. Hot springs also have a significant amount of CO2. It’s even used in certain skin creams.

## Is there a basis for the argument that Vitamin D lacks significant value or efficacy in supporting overall health and wellness?

The VITAL study, involving 26,000 participants, concluded that vitamin D supplementation provided minimal benefits, failing to reduce the risk of cancer, major cardiovascular events, stroke, or cardiovascular death. However, this study has been met with criticism due to several methodological flaws.

The VITAL study utilized drug trial protocols, with one group receiving vitamin D and the other a placebo. However, it failed to establish baseline vitamin D levels in participants and allowed both groups to consume up to 800 IU of vitamin D daily, potentially masking the supplement's effects.

Furthermore, the study focused on measuring the inactive form of vitamin D in the blood, primarily involved in skeletal health and calcium regulation. This overlooked the active form of vitamin D found within cells, which plays a crucial role in immune function, cancer prevention, inflammation reduction, and prevention of diabetes and dementia.

The VITAL study's dosage of 2,000 IU, considered high in their context, is deemed inadequate by many experts. Dr. Hollis cites a Townsend letter referencing six papers highlighting vitamin D's promising benefits, including reducing autoimmune disease, advanced cancer risk, autism, asthma, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Despite the VITAL study's conclusions, extensive research supports vitamin D's role in reducing breast cancer, tooth decay, depression, skin disorders, prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and colon cancer.

Research also emphasizes the benefits of sunlight, the optimal source of vitamin D. Sun exposure can significantly reduce breast cancer risk, lower blood pressure, and boost serotonin levels by up to 80%.

***

## Is there an alternative for Body Mass Index?

One of the biggest problems with BMI is that it doesn’t tell you how much fat you have versus muscle. It also can’t give you much of an idea of what's going on with your overall health. Other common measurements:

• BMR (basal metabolic rate): Measures how fast you’re burning calories

• TDEE (total daily energy expenditure): Measures the quantity of energy being burned

• Keto calculator: Measures BMR and TDEE and can tell you how many calories and how many macronutrients you should consume in a day based on your BMR and TDEE

Many times, people look at how much weight they lose per week as a measurement of how healthy their metabolism is. However, this isn’t a good idea. A big principle to consider is: get healthy to lose weight—don’t lose weight to get healthy. In the process of exercising and getting healthy, you’re going to gain muscle. Muscle is heavier than fat. This means that some weeks you may not lose any weight, but your clothes are still going to feel more and more loose. Instead of a BMI test, there are many other helpful tests you can do to help measure your overall health.

One of the best assessments of overall health is the metabolomic test. This test can look at your metabolic pathways in real-time. It can provide great data to help professionals understand what could happen down the road, so you can do something about it now.

## Is wet cupping beneficial?

Wet cupping is a traditional healing practice where cups are placed on the skin to create suction, followed by making small incisions to draw out a small quantity of blood. This technique is rooted in the belief that it helps eliminate toxins and promote overall well-being.

**Potential Benefits**

* **Pain Relief:** Wet cupping is often used to address chronic pain issues such as back pain and muscle tension.
* **Detoxification:** The removal of blood is thought to assist in detoxification, encouraging the flow of fresh blood and removing stagnant blood.
*   **Stress Reduction:** The process may also contribute to stress reduction and enhance relaxation.

    **Application**

    * **Procedure:** During a wet cupping session, cups are positioned on the skin, and a vacuum is created, drawing the skin upward. Subsequently, the cups are removed, and minor incisions are made. The cups are then replaced to extract a small amount of blood.
    * **Frequency:** The recommended frequency of wet cupping varies based on the individual's health condition and the practitioner's advice.

    **In summary, wet cupping is a traditional therapy that utilizes suction and bloodletting. It is purported to provide benefits like pain relief, detoxification, and stress reduction.**

## Magnesium: The Overlooked Hero for Heart Health

**Magnesium: The Overlooked Hero for Heart Health**

We all know the basics of heart health: eat right, exercise, and manage stress. But what about the lesser-known factors that play a crucial role? Magnesium, often overlooked, is a vital mineral for maintaining a healthy heart.

**Magnesium's Role in Heart Health:**

* **Combating Common Problems:** Magnesium deficiency is linked to various heart issues like plaque buildup, blood clots, irregular heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation), and high blood pressure.
* **A Natural "Medication":** Magnesium acts like a natural calcium channel blocker, regulating calcium levels, lowering blood pressure, and calming the nervous system. It even helps to lower adrenaline and relax muscles, similar to certain heart medications.
* **Hidden Deficiency:** Detecting a magnesium deficiency can be tricky since most magnesium resides within our cells, not in the bloodstream.

**Signs You Might Be Low in Magnesium:**

* **Unexplained Fatigue:** Feeling tired, especially after physical activity, can be a sign.
* **Migraine Headaches:** Magnesium plays a role in nerve function and blood vessel relaxation, making it crucial for preventing migraines.
* **Vitamin D Deficiency:** Magnesium is essential for vitamin D to function properly.

**Factors Affecting Magnesium Absorption:**

* **Dietary Culprits:** Alcohol, refined sugar, starches, and ultra-processed foods can hinder magnesium absorption or increase your body's need for it.
* **Lifestyle Factors:** Stress, certain medications (like antibiotics), and low stomach acid can also interfere with magnesium absorption.
* **Oxalates:** Some magnesium-rich foods, like spinach, almonds, and chocolate, contain oxalates, which can bind to magnesium and reduce its absorption.

**Choosing the Right Magnesium:**

Magnesium glycinate is a highly absorbable form of magnesium that's a great choice for supplementation.

**The Bottom Line:**

Don't underestimate the power of magnesium for heart health. If you're concerned about your magnesium levels, talk to your doctor and consider incorporating magnesium-rich foods or a quality supplement into your routine.

## NAC and Glutathione: A Powerful Partnership

NAC's primary mechanism of action is increasing the body's levels of glutathione. Glutathione is a vital antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress and damage caused by free radicals and toxins. When the body is exposed to excessive toxins or experiences high levels of oxidative stress, glutathione can become depleted, leading to cellular damage, particularly in organs like the liver.

Glutathione helps the body by:

* Detoxifying xenobiotics (poisons)
* Combating free radical damage
* Counteracting the effects of hydrogen peroxide
* Chelating heavy metals
* Reducing pathogens
* Decreasing oxidative stress

Factors Affecting Glutathione Levels:

Low glutathione levels can be associated with various conditions, including:

* Cancer
* HIV
* Infections
* Trauma and burns
* Chronic diseases and inflammation
* Overtraining
* Poisoning
* Diabetes

Other Nutrients that Support Glutathione Production:

Beyond NAC, other nutrients can also help boost glutathione levels, such as:

* Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA)
* Vitamin D
* SAMe (S-Adenosylmethionine)

## Natural Antibiotic Drink Recipe

The overuse of antibiotics is a major issue in the United States. Overuse of antibiotics leads to antibiotic resistance. This means that the microbes that are not killed by the antibiotics become stronger and resistant. When you take antibiotics again, they don’t work as well anymore.

Antibiotics do not kill yeast or viruses, but they do kill good microbes that keep the yeast at bay. This is why a common side effect of antibiotics is an overgrowth of candida or yeast.

Weaker antibiotics like penicillin and tetracycline work by slowing the growth of microbial reproduction. Stronger antibiotics like Cipro and Levaquin come with strong side effects and a black box warning.

If you have to take stronger antibiotics, always take magnesium, vitamin E, and probiotics along with them. After taking antibiotics, it could take weeks or even years to get your original microbes back. Because 80% of your immune system is your microbiome, this can have detrimental effects on your natural immunity.

Antibiotics naturally come from molds and other microorganisms found in the soil. These natural compounds have anti-inflammatory effects, antimicrobial effects, anti-diabetic effects, and anticancer effects.

**Here is the recipe for a natural antibiotic drink that should be taken at the first sign of a cough or illness:**

•3 cloves garlic

•90 drops Echinacea extract

•1 whole organic lemon (peel included)

•1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

•1 tablespoon raw honey

•16 ounces water

Blend all ingredients for about 45 seconds. Drink ⅓ of the mixture 3 times per day. If you’re in the middle of an infection, do this for the duration of the infection. You should notice a diminishing of symptoms, and you should sleep better. Also, take 50,000 IUs of vitamin D3 and 100 to 150 mg of zinc to boost your immune system.

## Should I consume turmeric?

You can consume organic turmeric or take a supplement. If you want to take a supplement, it’s best to get a turmeric supplement and not just curcumin. Curcumin is only one of many phytonutrients in turmeric. It’s also important that it’s a freeze-dried supplement. Black pepper or white pepper can help you increase the absorption of turmeric. You can also consume a small amount of fat at the same time for better absorption. Keep in mind that the phytonutrients in turmeric are heat sensitive, so cooking with turmeric could make them less potent.

The two main areas of research for turmeric are inflammation and cancer. A lot of the direct benefits of turmeric can lead to various other powerful effects, and turmeric also has virtually no side effects.

**Potential health benefits of turmeric:**

1\. It increases glutathione and other antioxidant networks

2\. It has potent effects on the brain and nervous system

3\. It has powerful effects on the cardiovascular system

4\. It’s antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-candida, antifungal, antiparasitic, and anti-H. pylori

5\. It shows great benefits for skin problems

6\. It helps protect the liver

7\. It helps stimulate phase-2 detoxification

8\. It inhibits pro-carcinogens

9\. It increases bile salts

10\. It supports the gut mucosal lining

11\. It helps protect the DNA and supports DNA repair and apoptosis

12\. It protects the cells during chemo or radiation therapy and may increase the effectiveness of the treatment

13\. It supports the endocrine system

## Should I cook turmeric?

You would think that heat would destroy all compounds. But, in the case of certain herbal remedies, heat actually seems to enhance certain phytonutrients.

In an interesting study, they tested roasting, boiling, and cooking turmeric at temperatures of 180 degrees Celcius or 356 degrees Fahrenheit for 70 minutes. They measured the total antioxidant capacity.

They found three very powerful antioxidants not only survived but were enhanced with this heat. This is called thermal degradation. It enhances the concentration and increases the solubility of certain phytonutrients.

## Should I drink turmeric water?

One study found that curcumin was just as effective as ibuprofen at reducing pain from arthritis without side effects! It’s also shown to be as effective as aspirin. Another study showed that curcumin had comparable results to Prednisone in reducing inflammation for rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and IBS. It has also been shown to produce antidepressant effects similar to Prozac and Zoloft.

Curcumin has anti-diabetic properties and effects similar to Metformin. It also has anticoagulant properties similar to aspirin and Warfarin. Research has shown that curcumin has benefits similar to statins and can help reduce LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. One study compared curcumin to 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapy drug.

Turmeric has been shown to be as effective as anti-inflammatory drugs, especially for irritable bowel disease and digestive problems. It may also help reduce blood pressure and inhibit pathogens, especially fungi.

To prepare turmeric water, combine ½ teaspoon of turmeric powder, a pinch of black pepper, and half of a lemon in a glass of warm water.

To prepare golden milk, combine ½ teaspoon of turmeric, ¼ teaspoon of cinnamon, and a pinch of black pepper in a cup of milk or coconut milk. Heat the mixture and remove from heat just before it comes to a boil. You can also add turmeric to a smoothie with berries and kefir. If you have a cough, try drinking a cup of hot water with a teaspoon of turmeric and a tablespoon of raw honey.

## Should I encourage my kids to play in the dirt more?

**More specifically, they should be playing in the soil.**

**The difference between dirt and soil:**

1\. Dirt is dead. This could be sand, rock, or clay.

2\. Soil is living. It contains bacteria and fungus, which make nutrients available.

There are two parts of the immune system. There is the innate part, which you're born with. Then there is the acquired part. The acquired part learns from the environment. If a child is sick, I believe the best thing is to let the child go through the infection while providing them with key nutrients and allow them to build up antibodies. There is a huge connection between the gut and the brain. There are a lot of microbes in the gut that play an important part in the immune system. The microbes work together to help keep pathogens from invading the body.

**Potential benefits of children being outside more often than inside:**

1\. A decreased risk of asthma, allergies, and autoimmune issues

2\. Less inflammation and respiratory illness

3\. Improved mental health (both cognitive function and mood)

## Should I stop taking supplements if I want to start a parasite cleanse?

Prior to embarking on a parasite cleanse or incorporating supplements during one, it is crucial to consult your healthcare provider for guidance and specific instructions.

***

## Should I take a separate magnesium supplement in addition to the magnesium included in the D3/K2 formula?

The magnesium included in the D3 & K2 formula is specifically there to support the activation of vitamin D3. It is largely utilized during the conversion and metabolic processes required for D3 to function effectively in the body. With that, the magnesium present in this product is not intended to contribute meaningfully to daily magnesium intake and should not be counted toward overall magnesium requirements.

***

## Should polyarthritis and gout be treated using the same approach, or are there specific treatments and management strategies tailored to each condition?

Polyarthritis and gout require different treatments. Gout is caused by a buildup of uric acid, often due to the kidneys' inability to excrete it, typically affecting the big toe. It involves uric acid, a potent antioxidant linked to heart disease risk. A video discussing new insights on gout management will be released soon.

Polyarthritis, affecting multiple joints, can result from autoimmune conditions or osteoarthritis, among other causes. To manage inflammation generally, reduce omega-6 fatty acids in your diet, increase omega-3 fatty acids, and take more vitamin D3.

***

## Should you take vitamin D3 & K2 separately?

Dr. Berg believes that Vitamin D3 & K2 can be taken together safely and effectively. In fact, he often recommends taking them together as they work synergistically to support various body functions. Including bone health, cardiovascular health, and immune function. If you have information from another source to take them separately please provide us with the scientific documents to support this. We will gladly share that with Dr. Berg.

## The #1 Blood Test Most Overlooked for Hair Loss

**Vitamin D: Essential for Healthy Hair Growth**

While often called a vitamin, Vitamin D actually functions as a hormone, playing a crucial role in numerous bodily processes, including hair growth. In fact, it influences approximately 10% of our genes, some of which directly impact hair follicle health.

**The Vitamin D and Hair Loss Connection**

* **Gene Regulation:** Vitamin D interacts with genes responsible for hair growth. Insufficient levels can disrupt this process, potentially leading to hair loss.
* **Immune Function:** Adequate vitamin D levels are essential for a healthy immune system. Deficiencies can increase the risk of autoimmune conditions like alopecia, where the immune system mistakenly attacks hair follicles.
* **Skin Health:** Vitamin D also plays a role in maintaining healthy skin. Conditions like psoriasis, dandruff, and dermatitis, which can contribute to hair loss, are often linked to low vitamin D levels.

**Magnesium's Role in Hair Health**

Magnesium is another critical nutrient for hair health. It regulates calcium absorption and is involved in enzymatic processes crucial for hair growth. Importantly, magnesium is also necessary for vitamin D to function optimally.

**The Two Faces of Vitamin D**

Vitamin D operates through two distinct systems in the body:

1. **Calcium Regulation:** This well-known system controls calcium absorption and bone health.
2. **Cellular Functions:** This lesser-known system impacts various cellular processes, including hair growth and restoration. This form of vitamin D has a short half-life (around 24 hours), necessitating daily replenishment through sun exposure or supplementation.

**The Global Vitamin D Deficiency Epidemic**

A widespread vitamin D deficiency is prevalent globally, contributing to various health issues, including hair loss. Factors contributing to this deficiency include:

* **Genetics**
* **Skin color**
* **Insulin resistance and diabetes**
* **Obesity**
* **Air pollution**

**Optimal Vitamin D Levels and Supplementation**

For healthy hair growth, aim to maintain blood vitamin D levels between 70 and 100 ng/mL. This may require daily supplementation of at least 20,000 IU of vitamin D along with 50 mg of magnesium.

**Other Essential Nutrients for Hair Health**

In addition to vitamin D and magnesium, ensure adequate intake of:

* **Zinc**
* **Iron**
* **Vitamin B12**
* **Omega-3 fatty acids**

**Key Genes Involved in Hair Growth**

Several genes play critical roles in hair growth, including:

1. **Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)**
2. **WNT genes**
3. **BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) genes**
4. **FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) genes**
5. **TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor-Beta) genes**
6. **LEF1 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)**
7. **PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)**
8. **Dkk (Dickkopf WNT Signaling Pathway Inhibitor) genes**
9. **CTNNB1 (Beta-Catenin)**

By understanding the vital role of vitamin D and other nutrients in hair health, and taking steps to address any deficiencies, you can support optimal hair growth and restoration.

## This Is CRAZY!

Homesteader John Moody is raising the alarm about a bill that could drastically change how livestock is tracked in America. He explains that while livestock identification has evolved over time – from branding to ear tags – a new threat is on the horizon: electronic identification (EID) using RFID technology.

Moody believes this push for EID, under the guise of safety, is actually part of a larger agenda to reduce meat consumption in the US and other Western countries. He argues that after failing to persuade people to eat less meat, authorities are now resorting to controlling the supply side by making it harder and more expensive for farmers to raise livestock.

This isn't the first time this issue has surfaced. In the early 2000s, the USDA attempted to introduce the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), which would have mandated RFID tagging for all livestock – except those in large-scale confinement operations (CAFOs). Moody emphasizes that the USDA has the authority to enact such rules without needing Congressional approval.

However, there is hope. Congresswoman Harriet Hageman, who has successfully blocked similar RFID mandates twice before, has introduced a bill to stop NAIS. Moody urges everyone, not just farmers, to get involved. He points out that a century ago, half of American households were involved in farming, compared to just 2-3 million farmers today. Supporting local farmers and buying food directly from them is crucial, but so is taking political action.

Moody calls on everyone to contact their Congressperson and Senator, urging them to support Hageman's amendment to prevent mandatory RFID tagging of livestock. He also highlights the Rogue Food Conference organized by Joel Salatin, which aims to fight regulations that hinder access to locally-sourced food. The next conference will be held on November 8th and 9th in Dallas.

This is a call to action to protect our food supply and support our farmers. By raising awareness and taking action, we can help ensure access to healthy, locally-sourced food for generations to come.

## Vitamin K2: The Overlooked Nutrient for Artery and Bone Health

**Vitamin K2: The Overlooked Nutrient for Artery and Bone Health**

It might surprise you to learn that Vitamin K2, found in many foods we've been told to limit, is actually crucial for maintaining healthy arteries and bones. A deficiency in this vital nutrient can contribute to a range of issues, from soft tissue calcification and bone loss to osteoporosis and even cavities.

**Where to Find Vitamin K2**

While our bodies can convert some vitamin K1 from leafy greens into K2, the most abundant sources are:

* **Natto:** This fermented soybean product reigns supreme in vitamin K2 content.
* **Organ Meats:** Eel, goose liver, chicken liver, and beef liver are also excellent sources.
* **Animal Products:** Butter and cheese from grass-fed animals, salami, and pork chops offer moderate amounts.
* **Fermented Foods:** Fermented vegetables like sauerkraut contain small amounts of K2.

**Why You Need Vitamin K2**

Vitamin K2 plays a vital role in directing calcium to where it belongs – in your bones and teeth – and keeping it out of your arteries and soft tissues. This process helps prevent calcium buildup, which can lead to hardened arteries and other health problems.

**Factors Affecting Vitamin K2 Production**

Several factors can hinder your body's ability to produce or utilize vitamin K2:

* **Gut Microbiome Imbalance:** A healthy gut is essential, as the microbe _B. subtilis_ is primarily responsible for converting K1 to K2. Unfortunately, this microbe is sensitive to:
  * Antibiotics
  * Steroids
  * PPIs and antacids
  * Glyphosate (found in GMO foods)
  * Alcohol
  * Junk food
  * High-sugar diets
* **Liver Health:** A compromised liver can impair K2 absorption.
* **Low-Fat Diets:** Since K2 is fat-soluble, adequate fat intake is necessary for absorption.
* **Magnesium Deficiency:** Magnesium works synergistically with K2 for optimal calcium regulation.

**Supplementing with Vitamin K2**

If you're concerned about your vitamin K2 levels, consider supplementing with MK7, the natural form of K2. A general guideline is to take 100 mcg of MK7 for every 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 you consume.

**Key Takeaway:** Don't underestimate the importance of vitamin K2 for your overall health. Prioritize a balanced diet with K2-rich foods, support your gut health, and consider supplementation to ensure you're getting enough of this critical nutrient.

## What acupressure techniques are effective for relieving gallbladder pain, and how can they be applied to manage discomfort associated with gallbladder issues?

#### **Acupressure Techniques for Pain Relief**

Acupressure is a gentle, non-invasive technique that involves applying pressure to specific points on your body to promote healing and relieve symptoms. For gallbladder issues, try massaging these acupressure points:

* Gallbladder 34 (GB34): Located on the outer side of your leg, in the depression just ahead of and below the head of your fibula bone
* Liver 3 (LV3): Found on the top of your foot, in the valley between your big toe and second toe
* Stomach 36 (ST36): Situated about four finger widths below your kneecap, on the outer edge of your shinbone

Gently massage these points for 1-2 minutes, 2-3 times daily, to help stimulate bile flow and alleviate discomfort.

## What additional factors, beyond nutrition and physical activity, can significantly impact bone health and contribute to the overall maintenance of skeletal integrity?

Beyond nutrients, other elements can influence bone health:

* Hormones: Hormones like estrogen play a crucial role in bone health. A decline in estrogen, common during menopause, can contribute to bone loss. It’s a reminder that hormonal balance is a critical factor in maintaining optimal bone density, especially for women.
* Cortisol: High cortisol, often associated with [chronic stress](https://www.drberg.com/blog/chronic-stress-literally-destroys-immunity), can negatively impact your bones, affecting density and strength. Remember that managing stress is not only beneficial for your mental well-being but also for the long-term health of your skeletal system.
* Metabolic Health: Individuals with bone loss, including [osteoporosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-taking-calcium-may-not-prevent-osteoporosis), often experience underlying metabolic concerns that reach beyond just [calcium deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-causes-and-symptoms-of-calcium-deficiency). These may include conditions like insulin resistance or nutrient absorption issues.

## What additional natural remedies can be employed to effectively lighten sunspots and improve overall skin tone?

While licorice extract is effective for fading sunspots, other natural remedies like kojic acid, vitamin C, and niacinamide can also help achieve an even, radiant complexion.

**Antioxidants in Skin Care**

Antioxidants like vitamin C, vitamin E, and green tea extract protect the skin from damage and reduce the appearance of dark spots. Vitamin C is particularly effective at slowing melanin production and boosting collagen.

**Acids for Skin Resurfacing**

\- AHAs: Glycolic and lactic acids exfoliate dead skin cells, revealing brighter skin and reducing fine lines.

\- BHAs: Salicylic acid clears clogged pores and reduces redness, making it great for acne-prone skin.

**Home Remedies**

\- Apple Cider Vinegar: Mix equal parts with water, apply, leave for 5-10 minutes, then rinse.

\- Lemon Juice: Apply directly, leave for 10-15 minutes, then rinse. Use sunscreen as it increases sun sensitivity.

\- Aloe Vera: Apply pure gel, leave for 20-30 minutes, then rinse.

**Incorporate these remedies into your skincare routine for a brighter, more even complexion. Be patient and consistent, as results can take weeks to months.**

## What additional strategies or interventions can be utilized to improve skin health and overall condition, beyond traditional skincare routines?

For best results in reaping the many hyaluronic acid benefits, I recommend also applying it topically. Be sure to look for a product without alcohol and one specifically designed to penetrate deeper layers of the skin.

Simply wet your hands, place several drops of the product in your hands, and massage it well into your hands, face, and neck once or twice daily.

Along with supporting your skin's natural hyaluronic acid production through proper diet and targeted supplementation, consider other important aspects that can impact overall skin health.

* [Hydration](https://www.drberg.com/blog/6-common-mistakes-we-make-while-drinking-water) is key. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your skin hydrated from the inside out. Contrary to what some might believe, drinking too much plain water can dehydrate you and even lead to mineral depletion. Consider adding a pinch of sea salt to your water or opting for [electrolyte-rich drinks](https://www.drberg.com/blog/electrolyte-drinks).
* What you put in your body directly impacts what you see on the outside. Nutrition is crucial in supporting overall health, and this includes skin health. Consume a nutrient-dense, healthy diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, lean protein sources, healthy fats, and avoid processed foods and sugar.

## What additional therapeutic benefits does ashwagandha offer beyond its primary uses?

An adaptogen is usually a plant or herb that helps increase the ability to adapt and avoid damage from harmful factors. The Latin word for adaptogen is "adaptare," which means to adjust or fit. The greek word for "GEN" means produced by or generated by. So, an adaptogen generates the ability to adjust to stress.

Stress is something that threatens homeostasis.

Homeostasis is a steady state of equilibrium. You have different normal values that are generated by different mechanisms that control homeostasis, which is your internal ability to adapt to the environment—to keep things normal. But, when you have stress, it can push some of these factors out of balance. For example, when you're stressed, cortisol goes up. In this situation, an adaptogen can help bring that back to normal. If your immune system is suppressed, adaptogens may even be able to help bring it back to a higher level.

**The four best adaptogens:** 1. Siberian ginseng 2. Panax ginseng 3. Rhodiola 4. Ashwagandha

**My favorite adaptogen is ashwagandha.**

**Ashwagandha can be good for:** • Inflammatory conditions like arthritis • Anxiety • ADHA • Stress relief • Lowering cortisol • Adrenal stress

## What additional treatments or lifestyle changes can help manage and improve sleep apnea, aside from conventional methods?

**Taking/eating garlic before bed is great for sleep apnea. Garlic in a pill form is a good idea, so you don’t experience indigestion.**

**Here are 7 reasons why garlic can benefit your sleep.**

1\. Garlic helps regular your blood pressure. By taking garlic, you can help lower high blood pressure levels. In turn, this may help you sleep much better.

2\. Garlic is a natural analgesic. Analgesics are things that help relieve pain.

3\. Garlic is naturally anti-fungal. Fungi can live in your sinuses, causing irritation and inflammation. In turn, this restricts your ability to breathe. Consuming garlic may help fight off inflammation-causing fungi.

4\. Garlic can help your lungs. If you have difficulty breathing, taking garlic may help support healthy breathing.

5\. Garlic is a natural anti-microbial. This means it can help fight off bacteria and other microbes that cause inflammation in your lungs and sinuses. Inflammation can restrict your breathing, which may contribute to sleep apnea.

6\. Fewer microbes also means less cortisol. Cortisol—also known as the “stress hormone”—is not good for quality sleep.

7\. Garlic helps improve your circulation. In turn, this promotes a relaxed state, which is better for sleep.

## What approaches can alleviate lumbar disc pain, and how do they target its causes?

Your intervertebral discs are made up of a gel-like center (nucleus pulposus) surrounded by tough rings (annulus fibrosus), all sandwiched between vertebral endplates. The center is mostly carbohydrate for holding fluid, while the outer rings are mostly protein for strength.

A herniated disc occurs when the gel-like center pushes through the outer rings, sometimes reaching the nerve root. This can cause pain due to inflammation and acidity within the disc.

Factors like type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and chronic high blood sugar increase the risk of disc herniation.

To potentially alleviate lumbar disc pain, consider these natural remedies:

1. Cut out inflammatory foods like sugar, refined carbs, and omega-6 fatty acids.
2. Practice intermittent fasting and occasional prolonged fasting.
3. Increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acids.
4. Supplement with vitamin D3 (20,000 IUs) and magnesium.

Remember, these are potential remedies and may not work for everyone. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

## What approaches can be considered for managing Alzheimer's disease when conventional treatments have proven ineffective?

Interestingly, smoking cigarettes and ibuprofen reduce LH and Alzheimer's risk. Now, I'm definitely not saying you should start taking ibuprofen and smoking cigarettes to prevent AD.

The drug Lupron—which is used for endometriosis, fibroids, prostate cancer, and breast cancer—also decreases the risk of Alzheimer's. Lupron also happens to lower LH. However, Lupron has numerous adverse side effects.

There is one drug without side effects that can also decrease LH: melatonin. Melatonin is stimulated by darkness, and it helps you get into a deep sleep. It also helps stimulate your immune system and offers powerful antioxidant properties.

Melatonin has significant effects when it comes to reducing Alzheimer's risk in women. Men can also see some benefits when taking much larger amounts of melatonin.

**Here is what the book recommends for reducing Alzheimer's risk.**

\- Females: 75mg of melatonin per day

\- Males: 120 mg of melatonin per day

\- 300mg pregnenolone

\- 3tsp MCT oil

\- Regular exercise

\- Fasting

Always check with your doctor before applying any of this information. This is just to educate you on these interesting links between hormones and Alzheimer's disease.

_**We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**_

## What approaches can be utilized to enhance the levels of glutathione in the body?

Glutathione is the most abundant antioxidant in the liver, but all of the cells make it. It reduces oxidative stress. Glutathione can help neutralize toxins that your body actually makes for various things. Glutathione also helps maintain exogenous antioxidants like vitamin C, and vitamin E. It not only acts as an antioxidant, but it also helps in detoxification. Because glutathione is sulfur, when you eat certain foods high in sulfur, you will give your body the raw material it needs to make more glutathione.

**How to boost glutathione naturally:**

• Sulfur-based vegetables (cruciferous vegetables)

• Vitamin C

• Selenium

• Milk thistle

• Fasting

**What decreases glutathione?**

• Alcohol

• Stress

• Age

• Drugs

• Toxins

## What approaches should be considered for managing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?

First, I want to start off by saying that ADHD is not genetic—there’s no evidence that says it is. In fact, it’s also not a Ritalin deficiency. From my viewpoint, it’s not even a mental disease—it’s purely a nutritional deficiency.

**Symptoms of ADHD include:**

• Inability to focus/pay attention

• Hyperactivity

• Restlessness

• Visual learning problems

• Difficulty reading

• Poor memory

A 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial showed significant improvements in the behavior of children with ADHD when given high doses of EPA and DHA (750mg) daily. If you have ADHD, (EPA and DHA) can help. You especially want to take EPA.

EPA and DHA are omega-3 fatty acids. You have omega-3s, and you have omega-6s. Your body cannot make these—you have to get them from your diet.

The problem is, you need more omega-3s and less omega-6s. Omega-3s are far more important. However, the average person consumes 16x more omega-6s. Omega-3s have antipsychotic properties, improve your cognition, and boost your IQ. They also help with brain development. Omega-3s can improve levels of dopamine and serotonin. They have neuron-protecting powers.

Vitamin B1 can also help your child with restlessness and hyperactivity. Nutritional yeast is a great source of B vitamins. You can try taking 750 mg of omega-3s EPA/DHA, reduce your intake of omega-6s, and increase vitamin B1 for ADHD.

## What are amino acids, and what is their significance in biological processes?

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Amino acids come in chains, which make up different types of proteins.

When you consume protein, your body breaks it down using acid and enzymes. This turns them into small amino acid particles.

Once your digestive system has broken down the proteins into amino acids, your body uses them to create many types of structures, including:

• Genes

• Blood

• Tissue

• Muscles

• Collagen

• Neurotransmitters

• Hormones

• Skin

• Hair

• Organs

• Enzymes

• Antibodies

There are simple proteins that are made from a handful of amino acids, and there are complex proteins that are made up of thousands of amino acids. Certain genes will act as "instructions" for assembling these amino acids into various structures.

Amino acids are needed to make over 50,000 different combinations. Amino acids are different from proteins and fats because they have an extra nitrogen molecule connected to them. This allows them to build and repair tissue. When you’re under stress, you need more amino acids to repair stress-related damage., Amino acids control your hunger, mood, emotions, sleep quality, and much, much more. There are essential amino acids and non-essential amino acids. Essential amino acids are ones that your body can’t create on its own—you must get these from your diet.

Eggs are the best source of amino acids. 3 to 6 ounces of protein per meal is optimal for your amino acid intake.

## What are antioxidants and free radicals, and how do they interact within biological systems?

Atoms are composed of electrons, protons, and neutrons. Most atoms have paired electrons, but a free radical has unpaired electrons. This means that there’s an electron on one side, but not on the other side of the atom.

Free radicals cause damage to your cells in the DNA and the mitochondria because they cause oxidation.

**Sources of free radical damage include:**

Radiation

Chemicals

Hydrogen Peroxide

Free iron

Free copper

High amounts of sugar

In the body, iron and copper are usually bound to protein, but they wreak havoc when they are free.

So, what is an antioxidant? Antioxidants donate an electron to neutralize the damaging effects of free radicals.

**Antioxidants include:**

Vitamin C

Vitamin E

Alpha lipoic acid

Selenium compounds

Beta carotene

Coenzyme Q10

Antioxidant-rich foods include superfoods like leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables. Try avoiding the sources of free radical damage that cause oxidation, and focus on consuming foods high in antioxidants.

## What are Dr. Berg's insights on the use of TTFD (Thiamine Tetrahydrofurfuryl Disulfide) as a supplement, particularly regarding its potential health benefits and applications?

Dr. Berg's thoughts on TTFD (thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide) highlight that it is a synthetic form of vitamin B1. While he prefers natural sources, such as allithiamine from garlic, he acknowledges that TTFD has proven to be effective.

Key points to consider:

1\. **Natural vs. Synthetic**: Allithiamine, derived from garlic, is a natural form of B1 that Dr. Berg favors. However, TTFD is also effective and can be a good source of B1.

2\. **Solubility**: The choice between fat-soluble and water-soluble forms of B1 depends on the intended use. For brain-related benefits, a fat-soluble form might be preferable, whereas benfotiamine, another B1 variant, effectively penetrates peripheral nerves but not the central nervous system.

3\. **Further Information**: For a more detailed discussion, Dr. Berg has a comprehensive video on this topic.

In summary, both natural and synthetic forms of B1 have their benefits, and the choice depends on the specific health goals.

## What are effective approaches and treatments for managing chronic stomach issues, and how can they help alleviate symptoms and improve digestive health?

For managing chronic stomach issues, I recommend the following approach:

1\. **Adopt a Ketogenic Diet**: This can improve digestion by reducing inflammation and balancing gut bacteria. Additionally, incorporating bile salts can help open the ducts between the liver and small intestine, enhancing bile flow, which aids in lubrication and digestion, and preventing the buildup of sludge that can cause discomfort.

2\. **Consider SIBO or Inflammation**: If the ketogenic diet does not resolve your digestive issues, it may be due to Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) or inflammation. In such cases, switching to a carnivore diet temporarily can help reduce symptoms by eliminating potential irritants and providing a nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory diet.

By following these steps, you can address common underlying causes of chronic stomach issues and improve your digestive health.

## What are effective methods for eliminating blackheads and sebaceous filaments?

We will also explore the root causes and how to address these issues to achieve long-term results.

**Many people mistake sebaceous filaments for blackheads and try to remove them by using tweezers or other methods. However, this can damage the skin.**

**The presence of sebaceous filaments and blackheads is often linked to the overproduction of sebum. This production is regulated by a hormone called androgens, which can increase during puberty, pregnancy, or other hormonal imbalances.**

So, how do we address the root cause of sebaceous filaments? **One way is to regulate and balance our androgen levels through dietary changes. Consuming foods high in vitamin A, D, and omega-3 fatty acids while reducing the intake of seed oils found in processed foods can help decrease sebum production.**

**Another way to reduce and balance androgen levels is through intermittent fasting and the keto diet, which helps lower insulin levels. High levels of insulin can also contribute to the overproduction of sebum.**

Additionally, zinc deficiency has been linked to raised sebum production. Consuming zinc-rich foods such as shellfish and red meat can help address this deficiency. Managing stress levels is also essential, as chronic stress can deplete our zinc levels.

## What are effective methods for shrinking excess skin, and how can they support skin tightening and improve appearance after weight loss or other changes?

[Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz\&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do _not_ encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provides this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast. If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

The most effective approach involves a combination of strategies:

1\. **Periodic Prolonged Fasting**: This helps the body recycle excess protein and collagen, promoting tissue repair and tightening.

2\. **Vigorous Exercise**: Engaging in regular, intense physical activity is crucial for enhancing muscle tone and skin firmness.

Focusing on these strategies can lead to significant improvements in skin tightening and overall body composition.

## What are effective methods to dissolve inner ear crystals and relieve vertigo symptoms?

**Understanding Vertigo: Causes and Potential Solutions**

While surgery and exercises may be used in vertigo treatment, they often don't address the underlying cause. Vertigo frequently stems from misplaced calcium crystals within the inner ear, disrupting the delicate balance signals sent to the brain.

**How Calcium Crystals Cause Vertigo**

Your inner ear contains a gel-like membrane with calcium crystals positioned on top. This system helps your brain sense movement and maintain balance. Problems arise when these crystals become dislodged, migrating into deeper areas of the inner ear. This can occur due to head injuries, infections, medications, or simply aging.

**The Calcium Connection**

Individuals with vertigo often have higher calcium levels in their inner ear fluid, suggesting difficulties with proper calcium regulation. Additionally, there's a strong link between osteoporosis (a condition of excess calcium in soft tissues) and vertigo.

**Vitamin D for Vertigo: A Potential Aid**

Vitamin D might help with vertigo by assisting your body in managing calcium. It promotes calcium absorption and deposition in bones, potentially reducing excess calcium buildup in the inner ear.

**Recommendations**

Consider a vitamin D3 supplement dosage between 10,000 and 20,000 IU. Crucially, combine it with vitamin K2 and magnesium for optimal results. Magnesium helps balance calcium levels in the body.

**Important Note:** Before starting any new supplement regimen, please consult your doctor for personalized guidance.

## What are effective methods to enhance cellular oxygenation, particularly through lifestyle modifications, dietary choices, and therapeutic interventions?

Increasing cellular oxygen levels is crucial for overall health and can be achieved through various methods:

1\. **Environmental Factors**: Sleeping with an open window, incorporating indoor plants, and spending time outdoors enhance oxygen availability.

2\. **Physical Activity**: Regular aerobic exercise promotes better oxygen utilization in cells.

3\. **Supplementation**: Methylene blue is noted for its potential to increase cellular oxygen levels.

4\. **CO2 Regulation**: Carbon dioxide, often seen as a waste product, plays a vital role in signaling the release of oxygen in the body. Methods like nasal breathing and paced breathing can help regulate CO2 levels, potentially benefiting conditions such as stress, anxiety, inflammation, and respiratory issues.

Maintaining optimal oxygen saturation, typically between 95 and 99, supports overall cellular function and health.

## What are effective remedies for alleviating sinus mucus, pressure, and post-nasal drip to improve comfort and reduce symptoms?

**This remedy may be beneficial if you’re experiencing:**

• Postnasal drip

• Chronic rhinitis or sinusitis

• Sinus pressure

• Sinus headaches or cluster headaches

• Sinus allergies

Common treatments for nasal congestion are steroids, medications, or even surgery. But, these options can have side effects or complications. **One of the best natural remedies for mucus in the sinuses is hot peppers.** You can consume hot peppers or use a nasal spray containing hot pepper. This is very different from pepper spray—we’re talking about a very diluted solution.

Instead of suppressing mucus, the phytonutrient in hot peppers may help drain mucus from the sinuses and reduce nasal hyperactivity. It can potentially help open the sinuses, drain the sinuses, and desensitize the mucus membranes in the sinuses. It’s also antimicrobial. Try consuming cottage cheese to help neutralize the effects of consuming hot peppers if needed.

## What are effective strategies for stopping extreme itching all over the body?

To address extreme itching across your body, consider the following steps:

1\. **TUDCA Supplementation**: Take TUDCA, a bile salt that aids in enhancing bile duct drainage in the liver. Start with two capsules daily on an empty stomach—one in the morning and one in the afternoon. This can help reduce systemic itching by alleviating bile accumulation in the liver, which may enter the bloodstream and cause skin irritation.

2\. **Gut Microbiome Support**: Support your gut health, particularly if you've used steroids, which can disrupt your gut flora. Begin with a high-quality probiotic, starting with a small dose and gradually increasing it to minimize potential immune reactions.

These measures may help mitigate the itching and improve overall skin comfort.

## What are effective strategies or treatments for managing and alleviating hot flashes?

Tocotrinols, that's a type of vitamin E works pretty good. I would do that if I were you, that would help you. And of course, there are other natural remedies that you can take. But really what's happening is you're just you're not getting this backup from the adrenal. The adrenals are a little bit weak. So if you support the adrenals, that will help you as well. (16:19) Sometimes iodine works. Sometimes vitamin E works. I would start with the vitamin E as in the form of tocotrinols.

## What are effective treatments and preventive measures for addressing toenail fungus, especially for those seeking natural remedies or over-the-counter solutions?

**Tea tree oil is a good one. Iodine will kill off the fungus. So you put that on the toe. That's a good one.There's many others. But the tea tree oil is a good one as well. You can also use garlic. There's quite a few things.**

**There's also a really good delivery natural remedy that actually comes from the processing of trees. It's called DMSO.** And it's a highly soluble solution that tends to have its own anti-inflammatory properties as well as anti-pain. And you can put it topically. But it can drive in.

You can put like aloe or put something with it to drive in nutrition into the body topically. You have to make sure that at the same time there's nothing else that's on your skin because let's say, for example you have some rat poison in your house and you're putting the rat poison out and you get that on your hand, and you put DSMO or DMSO on your hand, then it's driving the poison inside your body. So it has to be a clean area without any type of extra things that you don't want driven into your body.

What's really wild is a great little demo is to put a little couple drops on your feet and you'll taste some garlic almost instantly because it absorbs into the tissues. It's very soluble. It goes through right into the joint, into the muscles. That's just a great remedy. But of course, guess what? You're probably not gonna easily find it or anything positive about it when you do a search because all that stuff has been kind of filtered out as misinformation.

## What are effective treatments for Lyme disease, and how do they help alleviate symptoms and support recovery?

Lyme disease is commonly treated with antibiotics, which can unfortunately also harm beneficial bacteria in the body, potentially weakening the immune system.

In some cases, individuals may develop antibiotic resistance, leading to complications like chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, or autoimmune diseases after Lyme disease treatment.

There are over 900 tick species, and some carry Lyme bacteria, a spirochete known for its corkscrew shape. These bacteria can penetrate various tissues and evade the immune system by hiding in areas without immune cells.

A tick bite often results in redness, which might evolve into a bull's eye rash, a typical sign of Lyme disease.

The corkscrew bacteria can invade the heart, causing palpitations. They possess a defense mechanism allowing them to survive even after being engulfed by immune cells. Spirochetes also reduce receptors for vitamin D, a crucial vitamin for the immune system.

Vitamin D enhances the effectiveness of monocytes, a type of white blood cell. It also boosts antimicrobial peptides, which aid in killing spirochetes.

There are two main vitamin D systems. One regulates calcium, while the other supports immune cells, the heart, muscles, the central nervous system, and the intestines. This second system relies on vitamin D from sunlight, food, and supplements. This vitamin D remains in the body for only 24 hours.

If you suspect you have Lyme disease, consider taking at least 30,000 IU of vitamin D daily, even if you're on antibiotics. Whenever you take vitamin D3, ensure you also have sufficient magnesium, vitamin K2, and zinc.

Japanese knotweed and garlic may also offer benefits for managing Lyme disease.

## What are essential remedies and treatments to consider when you're feeling unwell or sick?

**To combat an infection, try to determine if you’re dealing with a viral infection or a bacterial infection.**

**Viral infection symptoms will be more systemic.** If you have a viral infection, you’ll notice more body aches and chills. Bacterial infection symptoms will be localized. Fevers are typically higher with a bacterial infection. A sore throat associated with a viral infection is often accompanied by a runny nose and a cough. If a sore throat is caused by a bacterial infection, you’ll feel more localized pain without a runny nose.

**A dry cough** is associated with a viral infection, while bacterial infections are associated with a productive cough. Respiratory infection, the common cold, flu, bronchitis, and infections involving the sinuses and lungs are generally viral. Pneumonia can be both bacterial and viral.

A viral infection typically lasts 1 to 2 weeks. A bacterial infection will probably last a bit longer, but this depends on your immune system. Mucus associated with a viral infection is usually clear or white and green or yellow with a bacterial infection.

**The best viral infection remedies are elderberry and olive leaf extract. For bacterial infections, try garlic, oregano oil, and echinacea.**

**The following remedies for infection work for both viral and bacterial infections:**

•Take a hot bath or shower/dress warm

•Get more sleep

•Take zinc, vitamin D, and vitamin C

•Fasting

•Increase sea salt intake

•Improve emotional state

•Get more sunlight (UVB and infrared rays)

•Take cod liver oil

**Stress, age, and poor gut health can increase your susceptibility to infection. Refined sugar and other refined foods deplete zinc and vitamin C, also increasing your susceptibility to infection.**

## What are liposomal vitamins, and how do they differ from regular vitamins in terms of absorption and effectiveness?

**Understanding Liposomal Vitamins**

Liposomal vitamins offer a unique delivery method. They use tiny spheres called liposomes, made of phospholipids, to encapsulate vitamins (or drugs). This protective layer helps the vitamins travel deeper into the body. The smaller the liposome, the higher the quality – so look for certified products.

**Pros and Cons**

Let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages of liposomal vitamins:

**Pros:**

* Significantly increased absorption (up to 4-9 times greater)

**Cons:**

* Much higher cost than traditional supplements
* Susceptible to breakdown by macrophages (immune cells)
* Often contain synthetic vitamins, sometimes from GMO sources

**Important Tip:** Always inquire about the source of the vitamins to ensure you're choosing natural options.

**Bottom Line:** Liposomal vitamins can be beneficial if you opt for a high-quality, certified product. However, be prepared for the significantly higher price tag compared to other forms of vitamins.

## What are natural solutions for managing and alleviating peripheral neuropathy?

**Peripheral Neuropathy: Natural Solution and the Root Cause**

Peripheral neuropathy is painful nerve damage often felt as burning, tingling, or hypersensitivity in the feet and hands. This video explains what causes peripheral neuropathy and offers a natural solution.

**What causes peripheral neuropathy?**

* **Diabetes:** The most common cause. High blood sugar damages the protective covering (myelin sheath) of nerves.
* **Other causes:** Chemotherapy, hypothyroidism, autoimmune diseases, medications, viruses, and Lyme disease.

**Natural Alternative for Peripheral Neuropathy**

Instead of just treating symptoms, it's vital to address the root cause. Here's how:

* **Benfotiamine:** A form of vitamin B1 that supports nerve health. Take 300mg, four times per day.
* **Lipoic acid:** Helps your body process excess glucose.
* **Vitamins B5, B2, B3:** Also aid in glucose metabolism.
* **Low-carb diet & intermittent fasting:** Crucial for controlling blood sugar and the true root cause of neuropathy.

**Important:** Prolonged nerve damage from diabetes is serious. This information is not a replacement for your doctor's advice.

## What are potential causes of chronic mucus drainage, and what strategies or treatments can help alleviate and manage this condition effectively?

It sounds like there's like this infection and this can happen if you had some type of earlier infection in your sinuses and even have that treated, especially with people that have like nasal type surgery. Where they take out some of this mucus membrane, you lose the probiotic, the good bacteria in your sinuses. Now you have this problem with this infection. If we take away any type of seasonal allergy a lot of people have like year-round fungal infections in their sinuses.

**So what can you do to stop that?** You can treat it and kill off these microbes, but they come back. A better approach would be to try some probiotics for your nasal passages and I've done videos on this too. You do not do this straight right from the jar but if you dilute a couple drops of kimchi juice apparently there's some interesting properties in there and do a nasal kind of irrigation that can maybe put some of that microbe back in there. There's certain products you can buy as well related to that but I would add a probiotic to your sinuses to help counter this post nasal thing. Which usually comes from a chronic fungal thing.

**In addition to that I hope you're on the keto and no sugar because that feeds the fungus and the yeast and the mold.** And then also there's several nasal cleanses that you can do with salt water and various things to put in there. But you want to keep that probiotic and also you want to take certain things that will indirectly help, garlic and onion. Those are natural antibiotics.

## What are potential remedies or lifestyle adjustments that could help reduce the frequency of nocturnal urination, and what underlying factors might contribute to this condition?

Nocturia is the urge to urinate at night when you should be sleeping, and it can interfere with your ability to get a good night’s sleep.

Nocturia is usually said to be caused by a bladder infection, a kidney infection, prostate issues, or aging. People with nocturia are not typically urinating a full bladder of urine. This means there must be an issue with the sensors in the bladder or the valve of the bladder.

If there’s too much sugar in the blood, a phenomenon known as osmotic diuresis can occur. This causes excess sugar and water to be excreted, which is why diabetics and people who are obese are at an increased risk for nocturia. If you have sleep apnea, you are also at an increased risk for nocturia.

Insulin resistance is the leading cause of obesity, diabetes, and sleep apnea, all of which lead to nocturia. Research has shown that insulin resistance itself can cause nocturia. The best way to address nocturia is to fix insulin resistance. To do this, stop snacking at night and work towards eliminating snacking altogether. Cut down your carb intake to less than 30 grams per day and do intermittent fasting. To speed things up, try consuming one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water before meals and exercise regularly.

## What are seven effective strategies to significantly boost your energy levels?

**Beyond the Caffeine Buzz: Understanding Real Energy**

You're right! Coffee doesn't actually give you energy, it just masks tiredness for a while. And that sugar rush? It leads to an energy crash later. So, what can you do to boost your energy naturally and avoid that slump?

**7 Natural Energy Boosters**

1. **Mighty Magnesium:** This mineral is crucial for making ATP, the energy your body runs on. Think leafy greens, nuts, avocado, and fish for magnesium-rich fuel.
2. **Charge Up Your Cells:** Your cells have a "sodium-potassium pump" that generates power for your muscles and nerves. Make sure you get enough of these electrolytes through food or a supplement.
3. **Mighty Mitochondria:** These are your cells' powerhouses! Exercise, fasting, a splash of cold water, and colorful polyphenol-rich foods (think berries and dark chocolate) can all help you build more mitochondria for extra energy.
4. **Ketone Power:** A keto diet can switch your fuel source to ketones, which burn cleaner and more efficiently than glucose.
5. **Carnitine Kick:** This compound shuttles fat to your mitochondria for fuel. It helps you work out longer and recover faster. Red meat is a great source of carnitine.
6. **Apple Cider Vinegar Advantage:** Your mitochondria can use this tangy tonic as an extra energy source. A tablespoon in water daily might do the trick.
7. **B Vitamin Boost:** B vitamins support your mitochondria, helping them turn food into energy. Nutritional yeast is a tasty source of these power-packed vitamins.

## What are some common but often overlooked nutrient deficiencies, and what steps can be taken to address and correct them effectively?

Subclinical nutrient deficiencies, though asymptomatic in the short term, can lead to significant long-term health issues. Ensuring a diverse, nutrient-rich diet is crucial for overall health.

\- Vitamin B1 Deficiency: Essential for brain function, a lack of vitamin B1 (thiamine) can result in cognitive decline and conditions like Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Sources include legumes and pork.

\- Niacin Deficiency: Severe deficiency in niacin (vitamin B3) causes pellagra, marked by diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death. Niacin is found in poultry, fish, and nuts.

\- Vitamin A Deficiency: Critical for vision, especially night vision, vitamin A deficiency can lead to night blindness and severe cases of blindness. Key sources include liver and leafy greens.

\- Vitamin E Deficiency: As an antioxidant, vitamin E protects cells and supports immune function. Severe deficiency can cause muscle weakness, vision problems, and heart arrhythmias. Sources include nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils.

## What are some common foods or habits that can unexpectedly lead to spikes in blood sugar levels, and how can individuals better manage their glucose response through dietary choices?

Justin Richard, motivated by a family history of type 2 diabetes, decided to take control of his health by exploring the impact of food on his blood sugar levels. Using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), he discovered how different foods affected him, particularly noticing the energy dips he experienced in his late 40s after consuming certain meals.

Initially, Justin followed his regular diet, which included a lot of processed foods. To his surprise, the CGM revealed how these foods caused significant and prolonged spikes in his blood sugar levels.

Through his experiments, Justin discovered some unexpected truths. He learned that white flour, bread, and even whole wheat bread had similar effects on his blood sugar, with Ezekiel bread being the least impactful. Additionally, he noticed that stress and lack of sleep caused his fasting blood glucose to rise significantly.

To manage his blood sugar levels, Justin adopted several strategies. He began combining carbs with protein, fat, and fiber to slow down digestion and reduce blood sugar spikes. He also found that drinking apple cider vinegar mixed with water before meals had a similar effect.

Justin shares his top tips for making healthier food choices and breaking bad eating habits:

1. Avoid grocery shopping on an empty stomach.
2. Resist the temptation to buy junk food at the store.
3. Take a walk after a large meal.
4. Don't consume sweets after meals or upon waking.

Based on his positive experience, Justin highly recommends the Signos CGM device as a tool for anyone interested in understanding and managing their blood sugar levels.

## What are some counterintuitive health tips that, despite seeming unusual, have proven to be highly effective for improving health?

**Hormesis describes two things that might oppose each other. In terms of health, hormesis refers to a controlled dose of stress that makes positive changes for your body.**

With hormesis, you can adapt to various types of stress, including exercise, radiation, cold, heat, hypoxia, plant chemicals, pesticides, insecticides, and fungicides. Sulforaphane found in broccoli sprouts and radish sprouts triggers the heat shock protein that allows the body to strengthen its detoxification enzymes. In this instance, the body is exposed to a small amount of poison that strengthens its ability to get rid of other poisons.

**The liver** contains phase 1 and phase 2 detoxification enzymes that can take a poison and turn it into a harmless particle. Sulforaphane triggers this system.

**Exercise** is one of the best examples of hormesis. Exercise induces microinflammation but then allows the body to get rid of inflammation.

**Fasting** activates the body’s mechanisms that counter starvation. It encourages our brain cells to grow, increases mitochondria, and regenerates the immune system.

**Health is often counterintuitive.** For example, cutting fat won’t help you lose fat, and sterilizing your environment won’t protect you from getting sick.

You can’t develop a strong immune system without getting sick. Antibiotics destroy good bacteria in the body, which can lead to pathogen overgrowth. Antacids can lead to more heartburn because you need more acid to get rid of heartburn.

When you don't expose yourself to the sun, you put yourself more at risk for certain types of cancers. Many people have been told that the sun causes cancer, but the sun gives us vitamin D. Having a deficiency in vitamin D can increase your risk for cancer.

**One last example is dieting.** The more dieting you do in your lifetime, the more weight you will gain—especially if you’re doing it incorrectly.

## What are some effective and scientifically supported natural remedies for mitigating the symptoms of anemia?

Iron deficiency anemia is either a case of lowered red blood cells, decreased hemoglobin, or a decreased ability to carry oxygen through the blood.

Iron deficiency symptoms include feeling tired, craving ice, weakness, and shortness of breath. In advanced cases, paleness is also a sign of iron deficiency.

Several things can cause iron deficiency anemia. Blood loss caused by menstruation or trauma, ulcers, parasites, fibroids, cancer, infections, and genetics are all potential causes of iron deficiency. One of the most common causes of iron deficiency is decreased absorption of iron caused by low hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Many people have low stomach acid which causes problems like GERD, acid reflux, and heartburn.

Apple cider vinegar with your meal can increase the absorption of iron and also decrease the negative side effects of low stomach acid. Antacids can worsen the problem by further depleting your stomach acid, making the stomach more alkaline, and decreasing the absorption of iron.

Oxalates found in spinach and Swiss chard can also deplete iron. If your diet is high in grains, you’re probably consuming a lot of phytic acid which can also bind to important minerals and decrease their absorption. Gastric bypass surgery can cause you to become deficient in iron. This surgery decreases the surface area of the stomach and decreases the absorption of iron and other important minerals. Digestive problems like IBS, Crohn’s, and celiac can also cause you to become deficient in iron.

It can be helpful to add the following iron-rich foods to your diet if you have iron deficiency anemia:

•Clams

•Oysters

•Meat

•Eggs

•Liver (grass-fed)

•Octopus

•Spirulina

## What are some effective dietary sources for increasing glucose levels?

People often have an idea that your body — especially your brain — can only run on glucose. But that’s not true! You can run your body on ketones, which provide about forty to seventy percent of the energy you need. Of course, the question becomes, what kind of fuel makes up the difference? There will always be a small amount of glucose, but your body can run on fatty acids. Fat turns into ketones and fatty acids.

Your brain is a little different; it can use ketones for seventy percent of its fuel, with the rest coming from lactate or glucose. Where will you get the glucose if you don’t want to eat carbohydrates? Your body makes its own, in a process called gluconeogenesis. Your body uses fat and protein to make glucose. Certain amino acids in protein turn into glucose, as does a component of fat which breaks down into glycerol, then converts to glucose. Your body can easily get the glucose it needs from fat and protein. You don’t need carbohydrates to supply glucose.

## What are some effective methods for detoxifying and cleansing the lungs?

Let’s talk about the best ways to detox your lungs naturally. Air pollution, cigarette smoke, and cleaning chemicals are just a few of the things that can affect the lungs. But, certain natural remedies may help detox the lungs and potentially help decrease the risk of conditions like COPD and cancer. Cancer tends to spread into areas of inflammation. If the lungs have inflammation, they become a target for cancer. Inflammation can also lead to fibrosis. So, we want to focus on natural ways to reduce lung inflammation. When chemicals go into the lungs, they don’t stop in the lungs. Chronic exposure to toxins in the air can also lead to problems with the liver and heart.

**The best remedies to detox the lungs:**

1\. Milk thistle

2\. Tocotrienols

3\. Vitamin D

4\. Pneumotrophin PMG® (Standard Process)

## What are some effective methods for increasing oxygen levels in the body?

VO2 max is the volume of oxygen your body can consume over a certain amount of time. You can get this test from doctors who specialize in sports medicine.

To increase your VO2 max, you need to consider two things:

1\. CO2 - CO2 allows oxygen to go deep into the tissues.

2\. Lactic acid - Built-up lactic acid affects your pH and muscles, making breathing and exercising more difficult. Top athletes with efficient mitochondria, who have increased their capacity to absorb oxygen and get rid of lactic acid, have bulletproofed themselves against disease. They also have high VO2 max scores. This makes the VO2 max test a good measurement to help evaluate your overall health. The best ways to increase VO2 max, and therefore, longevity: 1. Exercise • Do HIIT (high-intensity interval training) 2. Increase CO2 tolerance • Practice nasal breathing • Practice holding your breath

3\. Increase your lactic acid tolerance • Do HIIT • Get plenty of thiamine (vitamin B1) • Avoid sugar

4\. Hypoxic training • Restrict air while exercising or exercise at high altitudes

5\. Respiratory muscle training • Try inspiratory muscle training and expiratory muscle training

6\. Plyometric training • Try explosive short bursts of exercise

7\. Fartlek training • Try speeding up and slowing down your pace sporadically while running

8\. Cross-training • Combine different exercises in one workout

9\. Sleep • Sleep eight or nine hours a night

10\. Don’t overtrain • Get plenty of recovery between workouts

11\. A healthy diet • Get on the Healthy Keto® diet • Do intermittent fasting

## What are some effective natural alternatives to Adderall for enhancing focus and cognitive function without the use of pharmaceuticals?

There is an interesting natural adderall alternative that has virtually no side effects. It’s called Mucuna Pruriens or velvet bean. Mucuna Pruriens increases L-dopa, which turns into dopamine (a body chemical that triggers feelings of pleasure).

**Benefits**

* Increases focus and concentration
* Decreases brain fog
* Increases ability to learn
* Increases memory
* Increases mood
* Decreases stress
* Neuroprotective

**How to consume it**

You may want to cycle consumption of this substance by taking it for four days in a row and then not taking it for three days in a row or so forth. Follow the directions on the label for the proper dosage.

If you are trying to substitute velvet bean for adderall, consult with your medical doctor prior to undertaking it.

It will work a lot better if you also correct your diet by doing Healthy Keto® and intermittent fasting. Mucuna pruriens may help with symptoms, but you really want to correct the root cause of brain fog and lack of focus by fixing your diet.

**Where to get it**

You can get it at a health food store or order it online.

## What are some effective natural home remedies for managing and treating tinea versicolor?

It looks similar to vitiligo but less intense. This fungus releases an acid that inhibits melanin, causing a loss of pigment. If you get it, you then have an 80% chance of getting it again.

**HOME REMEDY**

1\. Oregano oil

2\. Tea Tree Oil

3\. Thyme Oil

4\. Grapefruit Seed Oil

5\. Coconut Oil

Mix 4 drops of 1 or more of these oils in a tablespoon of coconut oil and mix - then apply it to your skin before bed. However, you need to work on your gut because ultimately, it's a loss of internal microbes that set you up for this condition. Antibiotics, cortisone treatments, being a diabetic, having PCOS, and even malnutrition can all set you up for getting this condition.

## What are some good drinks to manage diabetes and support blood sugar levels when I'm asleep?

These 7 drinks help improve sleep quality by preventing troublesome issues like night waking and nighttime urination.

Blood sugar often decreases at night, increasing cortisol, which increases blood sugar levels. Poor sleep can also cause blood sugar issues, and frequent urination at night can contribute to this problem. Here are 7 nighttime drinks to help stabilize blood sugar levels throughout the night. Try these drinks to support healthy blood sugar levels and improve sleep.

1\. Apple cider vinegar with cinnamon

Add one to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with a pinch of cinnamon to a glass of water for the perfect blood sugar-balancing drink.

2\. Chamomile tea

Chamomile tea lowers cortisol and stabilizes blood sugar by directly supporting the cells in the pancreas.

3\. Golden milk

Combine turmeric and ginger with milk to make a delicious blood sugar-balancing latte.

4\. Aloe vera juice

Aloe vera is known to help with digestion and ulcers and can be applied topically to wounds, but it also potently affects the cells that make insulin.

5\. Berberine tea

This herb is close in effectiveness to Metformin, just without the side effects!

6\. Electrolyte drinks (without sugar)

Potassium and magnesium are vital for healthy blood sugar levels. Magnesium can significantly decrease cortisol, while potassium can reduce blood sugar and is essential for glucose storage in the liver and the muscles. Most people are not getting enough potassium!

7\. Salt in water

Sodium is an important electrolyte that helps reduce blood sugar and cortisol. Add it to water or your electrolyte drinks to help increase hydration. It also supports the adrenal glands, nerves, and muscles.

***

## What are some good magnesium foods?

**Top magnesium foods:**

1\. Pumpkin seeds

2\. Spinach

3\. Swiss chard

4\. Almonds

5\. Leafy greens

6\. Dark chocolate (sugar free)

When people have low stomach acids, they can't absorb magnesium as well. This occurs when people have heartburn or acid reflux (which is counter-intuitive) or GERD.

Most of the magnesium is stored in the bone, it's involved in enzyme activation. We need this mineral for generation of energy, decreases stress, constipation, nerve and muscle physiology. Magnesium can help lower blood pressure, help with constipation, lower stress and enhance sleep.

Magnesium is at the heart of chlorophyll in leafy greens.

***

## What are some good nutritional sources of zinc?

Foods high in zinc include oysters, red meat, and other meats like lamb chops, pork tenderloin, and venison. Eggs, milk, cheese, and other dairy products provide many vitamins and minerals essential for a healthy body, including zinc and calcium.

***

## What are some highly regarded magnesium supplements that have demonstrated effectiveness in addressing deficiencies and supporting overall health?

While getting magnesium from food is ideal, supplementation can be beneficial if you struggle to meet your needs through diet alone. However, it is advisable to consult with your doctor to determine the proper dosage and type of supplement best suited for you.

Several forms of magnesium supplements are available, including:

* Magnesium Citrate: Often recommended for its high bioavailability and potential laxative effects.
* Magnesium Glycinate: Known for its high absorption rate and ability to promote relaxation.
*   Magnesium Oxide: A common form found in many supplements, but it has lower bioavailability compared to other types.

## What are some intriguing facts regarding vitamin D, including its physiological roles, sources, and the implications of deficiency on overall health?

Vitamin D is responsible for the 20x increase in calcium absorption in the small intestine. It also increases the absorption of iron, magnesium, zinc, and phosphate to mineralize the bone and support other tissues in the body. However, it has to be activated through an enzyme in the liver and kidney.

Vitamin D is very important in controlling immunity to viruses, especially in the lungs and in autoimmune diseases. Make sure to take vitamin K2 when you take vitamin D because it helps deliver calcium to the bone.

Possible Causes of Vitamin D Deficiency:

• Liver Damage

• Kidney Damage

• Fatty Liver

• Cirrhosis of the liver

• Kidney Dialysis

Importance of Vitamin D

• 20x increase in absorption of calcium

• Increases absorption of iron, magnesium, zinc, and phosphate

• Controls immunity to viruses

• Can turn off asthma symptoms

• Strong bones

• Prevents deformation of bones

• Prevents chronic muscle/skeletal pain

Vitamin D Deficiency

• Weak and Fragile Bones

• Bones Fracture Easily

• Bowed Legs

• Bending of Spine

Hypercalcemia Signs and Symptoms: (Too much calcium)

• Increased excessive urination

## What are some lesser-known benefits of magnesium supplementation beyond muscle function and bone health?

Magnesium offers numerous benefits that often fly under the radar. Let's explore some of these lesser-known perks:

* Regulating Cholesterol: Magnesium supports healthy cholesterol levels. It promotes a favorable balance between ["good" (HDL)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-powerful-agent-to-raise-hdl) and ["bad" (LDL)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/understanding-ldl-in-simple-terms) cholesterol. Maintaining this balance is a crucial aspect of cardiovascular health and can lower the risk factors associated with heart disease.
* Boosting Energy Production: Think of ATP as our cells' primary energy currency. Magnesium is directly involved in its creation, meaning it's vital for combating fatigue and maintaining energy. If you often experience low energy levels, a magnesium supplement could be beneficial.
* Supporting Blood Sugar Balance: Studies suggest magnesium can contribute to healthy blood sugar control. This is especially relevant today, as blood sugar imbalances are increasingly common. For individuals looking to regulate blood sugar levels, incorporating magnesium-rich foods or a supplement into their diet might be advantageous.
* Even Contributing to DNA Formation: Magnesium is involved in the building blocks of life. It plays a vital role in DNA replication and repair, processes essential for overall health and longevity. This highlights the importance of ensuring sufficient magnesium levels for overall well-being.

## What are some natural and effective methods to enhance the production of Human Growth Hormone (HGH)?

Sprinting is an explosive form of HIIT and has the potential to drastically increase human growth hormone.

**Sprinting can be described as a short bout of full-speed running. Sprinting puts your body under maximum stress, but only for a short amount of time. Try sprinting for about 20 to 30 seconds at a time with 90 seconds of rest in between your sprints, working up to 8 sprints.**

Sprinting can be twice as effective as injecting human growth hormone. If you also decrease your stress levels, increase your sleep quality, and do keto and intermittent fasting, you can really boost HGH naturally.

**To best stimulate human growth hormone, you’ll want to do a short-duration, high-intensity workout with lots of rest. Growth hormone is stimulated by high-intensity exercise but decreases with the duration of exercise. If you have any issues like knee problems that may inhibit your ability to sprint, you can do this same type of exercise on a bicycle or while swimming.**

## What are some nutrient-dense superfoods that support optimal kidney health, and how do their specific properties contribute to protecting and enhancing renal function?

The kidneys are composed of complex filters known as nephrons. A proper diet is crucial to support these nephrons. If your nephrons are damaged, you may end up with a build-up of phosphorus, potassium, and sodium. It is essential to avoid junk food and minimize eating out.

One of the leading causes of kidney damage is diabetes, which comes from high blood sugar. Avoid sugar and compounds that act like sugar in the body, like refined starches. Drugs, alcohol, certain medications, smoking, and ultra-processed foods all destroy the kidneys. Seed oils like corn oil, soy oil, cottonseed oil, and canola oil contribute to inflammation and damage to the kidneys as well.

**Here are eight superfoods to include in your diet if you’re dealing with kidney damage:**

1\. Low phosphorus protein (sardines, salmon, cod, and sea bass)

2\. Spirulina

3\. Fermented foods (sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles)

4\. Avocado

5\. Extra virgin olive oil

6\. Cottage cheese or goat cheese

7\. Vitamin D

8\. Baja Gold sea salt

If you have kidney damage, you’ll want to avoid foods that are high in oxalates, lectins, and tannins. Avoid things like nuts, spinach, meats high in phosphorus, eggplant, potatoes, beans, and grains. Cat scans to examine damage to the kidney can also be very damaging. Opt for an ultrasound or MRI to assess kidney damage if possible.

**If you have kidney disease or kidney problems, you can still consume vegetables. The following vegetables are safe options for people with kidney issues:**

•Asparagus

•Celery

•Avocado

•Cucumber

•Garlic

•Cabbage

•Cauliflower

•Mushrooms

•Lettuce

## What are some scientifically-supported strategies and techniques for accelerating the process of falling asleep, and how can they enhance sleep onset and overall sleep quality?

**First, let’s take a look at the reasons why you might be having trouble getting to sleep.**

1\. Overtraining or too much exercise causes the sympathetic nervous system to go up, keeping your adrenaline high and preventing sleep.

2\. If your room is too hot, it can interfere with your sleep quality.

3\. High carb consumption and stress deplete vitamin B1. Vitamin B1 is essential for the parasympathetic nervous system, so a deficiency will keep you up at night. Try taking vitamin B1 before bed for better sleep.

4\. Too much caffeine is a common cause of poor sleep.

5\. Poor gut health can inhibit good sleep. Kefir as a probiotic can help!

6\. Insulin resistance inhibits the absorption of tryptophan, a precursor to melatonin. This can interfere with your ability to fall asleep fast.

7\. Some people have trouble sleeping after being on keto or the carnivore diet for a long period of time. This is because their insulin is very low. Try having a cup of berries with your last meal to fix this problem.

8\. Sodium deficiency can cause problems with your sleep. This can be caused by fasting, OMAD (one meal a day), or not adding enough sodium to your diet. Low sodium can cause your sympathetic nervous system to go up which can keep you from sleeping.

If you want to know how to fall asleep instantly, try this simple sleep technique! You’re going to breathe in a way that synchronizes your heartbeat and blood pressure to the rhythm of your breathing. This will help stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, inducing sleep very quickly. Try practicing with a timer first! Breathe in for 5 ½ seconds and breathe out for 5 ½ seconds. This will give you about 5 ½ breaths per minute. When doing this technique, breathe through your nose, and within minutes you will fall asleep.

## What are some simple health tips to improve well-being and prevent chronic diseases?

**Supplement Smarts: Getting the Most Out of Your Vitamins**

1. **Timing Matters:** Morning is ideal for energizing supplements, but avoid electrolytes before bed. Experiment with vitamin D timing. Don't take calcium on an empty stomach.
2. **Slow and Steady:** Introduce supplements one at a time to gauge their effects on your health.
3. **Diet First:** A balanced diet rich in protein and low in carbs is crucial. Supplements can't fix a poor diet.
4. **Quality Counts:** Cheap vitamins often contain fillers, dyes, and low-quality ingredients. Prioritize natural sources and avoid synthetic versions whenever possible.
5. **Avoid Overlap:** Don't take both supplements and medication for the same issue.
6. **Synergy is Key:** Some vitamins work best together. Pair high-dose vitamin D with magnesium and watch for copper deficiency with high zinc intake.
7. **Trust the Experts:** Seek advice from knowledgeable sources.
8. **Dosage is Crucial:** The recommended daily allowance (RDA) might not be enough for therapeutic effects. Consult with a healthcare professional to determine the right dosage for you.
9. **Vegans Need Supplements:** Ensure you're getting enough vitamin B12, vitamin D3, omega-3s, iron, zinc, iodine, and calcium.
10. **Vitamin D Needs:** Your body might require around 10,000 IU of vitamin D daily.

**Remember:** Supplements are a tool to support your health, not a replacement for a healthy lifestyle. Use them wisely, and consult a healthcare professional if you have any concerns.

## What are some unexpected benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar?

Both good bacteria and bad bacteria can go into a dormant state. Microbes in a dormant state are protected from many environmental stresses and chemicals, especially antibiotics. Dormant microbes can survive for decades or even thousands of years! A change in environment, like a change in pH, can wake good bacteria or cause them to go dormant. Most good bacteria thrive in an acidic environment. Apple cider vinegar acidifies the environment for good microbes. Things like kombucha, pickle juice, sauerkraut, and kimchi have similar effects.

Certain microbes create butyrate, which helps with insulin resistance. These microbes thrive in an acidic environment. We have a synergistic relationship with the microbes in our gut. We provide a home, and they provide immune protection, help with digestion, vitamin production, and more. By making their environment more acidic, you help activate them.

H. pylori releases ammonia, which alkalizes the stomach acid. This allows it to do its damage, causing ulcers in the stomach and small intestine. C. diff, E. coli, and salmonella go into a state of dormancy when the pH drops below 6. When your immune system is suppressed, bad bacteria can come out of dormancy. Antibiotics, stress, Prednisone, and vitamin D deficiency can all suppress the immune system and activate pathogenic microbes. Adequate vitamin D in amounts of at least 10,000 IU daily may help keep pathogenic microbes in remission. Try drinking 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water every evening with a straw to support your beneficial microbes. Fairchild’s Apple Cider Vinegar is an excellent option.

## What are some unexpected benefits of iodine?

Iodine is highly antiestrogenic. Estrogen dominance increases the risk of cancer, especially in the breast, ovary, and uterus. Iodine causes cancer cells to self-destruct. Iodine strengthens the thyroid, which improves your overall health. It also strengthens the immune system and reduces inflammation.

Iodine is also vital for a healthy pregnancy. Iodine is considered a halogen, so other halogens like bromide and fluoride compete with iodine in the body. Increasing your iodine intake can help detox these other halogens. Try drinking water with unrefined sea salt for several days, then begin taking Lugol’s iodine solution—a mixture of two different types of iodine. Take this solution for about five days, then take two days off.

Also, consume between 3 and 9 grams of vitamin C, 400 mg of magnesium, 100 mg of selenium, and the complete B-complex to detox these other halogens completely. If you have hyperthyroidism, do not take iodine.

Just because you’re allergic to shellfish does not mean you are allergic to iodine.

Goitrogenic foods like cruciferous vegetables and lima beans block iodine—but if you regularly consume sea kelp, it counters any bad effects. High amounts of iodine can be beneficial for respiratory viruses. Iodine also binds with mercury and aluminum, helping rid the body of toxic metals.

***

## What are some unexpected benefits of magnesium?

**Magnesium is a very important mineral. Magnesium is in hard water, mineral water, and leafy greens.** Magnesium is not just essential for humans, but for plants too. Chlorophyll is like the blood of a plant, and a magnesium deficiency can inhibit a plant’s ability to make chlorophyll.

Chlorophyll is similar in chemistry to our blood. The magnesium in the chlorophyll causes the leaves of a plant to look green, and the iron in our blood makes it look red. There is a condition called chlorosis in plants caused by a magnesium deficiency. Chlorosis in humans is anemia and is caused by an iron deficiency. But, a person with anemia may even look a little green.

**The unexpected benefits of magnesium:**

1\. It relieves muscle tightness

2\. It boosts energy

3\. It supports vitamin D bioavailability

4\. It helps prevent calcium from depositing in the soft tissues

5\. It can help relieve migraines

6\. It supports your friendly bacteria

7\. It can potentially help reduce paresthesia

8\. It helps counter cortisol

9\. It helps balance the parathyroid hormone

## What are some viable alternatives to melatonin for enhancing sleep quality and regulating circadian rhythms?

Tryptophan is an amino acid that can help your mood and counter anxiety. Let’s look at the common benefits of consuming tryptophan.

**Benefits**

* Virtually no side effects
* Can act as a natural antidepressant
* Has anxiolytic properties (anti-anxiety)
* Can promote sleep

**How to consume it**

Follow the directions on the label for the proper dosage. However, if you’re on any psychiatric medications, talk to your doctor before substituting with tryptophan, as it has to be a very gradual process. You also don’t want to come off of medication too quickly or add something else to the mix that could create an imbalance.

When you take tryptophan, you always want to take it on an empty stomach. Tryptophan competes with other amino acids. Any time you take tryptophan with another protein, it won’t work.

**Where to get it**

You can get it at a health food store or order it online.

## What are the benefits of arginine supplementation for muscle growth, particularly regarding muscle protein synthesis and performance?

Introducing another powerful player in the muscle-building game – [Arginine](https://www.drberg.com/blog/10-benefits-of-l-arginine). This amino acid works its magic by boosting growth hormone production, a key factor in muscle repair and development.

It acts like taking the brakes off growth hormone, allowing it to surge through your system and exert its muscle-building effects.

Studies, even in children, have demonstrated the growth-promoting effects of Arginine. Some findings suggest that supplementing with arginine can help increase height.

This growth hormone boost isn't just limited to height; it can translate to increased muscle growth and strength as well.

Incorporating a higher amount of arginine, around 3 to 6 grams daily on an empty stomach, especially 30 minutes before your workout, could provide that extra edge you’ve been searching for.

Arginine is naturally found in foods like red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products, so ensuring you're getting enough of these protein sources can contribute to your daily arginine intake.

## What are the benefits of castor oil for skin if I want to get an anti-aging effect?

Castor oil can naturally give your skin a soft, glowing, firm look. It’s the best remedy for wrinkles or dry skin. Castor oil contains ricinoleic acid, a penetrating moisturizer for your skin and hair. It also has powerful anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Many skin-related problems are caused by an overgrowth of bacteria, yeast, or fungus. Castor oil is the perfect antidote—you can even use it for acne. Castor oil contains vitamin E, which can protect your skin from UV radiation and pollution. It has potent wound-healing properties and can help fade dark spots for an even complexion.

Castor oil contains beta-carotene, the precursor to vitamin A, which supports the skin. It also contains magnesium and potassium. Evidence suggests castor oil can help stimulate collagen synthesis, which is vital for anti-aging. Apply castor oil routinely to scars, stretch marks, and acne scars to help them fade.

Many people dilute castor oil with other oils, such as coconut or olive oil, because of its thick and sticky texture. It can also be used as is.

Take a couple of drops and rub them into your skin, focusing on dry, wrinkled, reddened, or irritated areas.

Try using castor oil before bed, so it has plenty of time to penetrate the skin. Be careful using castor oil around the pelvic area or abdomen if you’re pregnant, as it can induce labor.

To use castor oil for hair growth, massage it into your scalp. This can help stimulate hair growth, especially if you have alopecia. You can also rub a few drops through your hair before bed. Look for organic, cold-pressed, hexane-free castor oil for the best quality and the most benefits.

Many people have seen positive effects from Jamaican black castor oil.

You can also use castor oil for eyelashes! Apply a small amount of castor oil to the root of your eyelashes daily to strengthen and lengthen your eyelashes. You don’t have to worry about the toxin in castor oil because it’s eliminated in the manufacturing process.

## What are the benefits of fish oil for cardiovascular health, and how do its compounds affect blood lipids, inflammation, and circulation?

**Fish Oil: The Natural Blood Thinner with Many Benefits**

Ever wondered if fish oil acts as a blood thinner? The answer is yes! It contains omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) that can reduce blood clotting and promote healthy blood flow. This means a lower risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular issues.

But, there's a catch: if you're on blood-thinning medication, taking fish oil could increase your risk of excessive bleeding. So, it's important to consult your doctor before adding fish oil to your routine.

Fish oil, derived from oily fish like salmon and sardines, is a fantastic source of EPA and DHA. These omega-3s play vital roles in:

* **Brain Health:** Boosting memory and cognitive function
* **Eye Health:** Protecting against age-related vision decline
* **Immune Function:** Strengthening your body's defense system
* **Heart Health:** Reducing inflammation, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels
* **Weight Management:** Improving insulin sensitivity and promoting satiety
* **Mental Health:** Lowering the risk of depression
* **Skin Health:** Strengthening the skin's barrier and reducing inflammation

**Fish Oil Dosage: How Much is Enough?**

Most fish oil supplements provide 1-2 grams of omega-3s per serving, which is a good starting point. However, higher doses (up to 4 grams) may be beneficial for specific health conditions.

Pregnant women and those with high triglycerides or cholesterol should consult their doctor about optimal fish oil dosage.

**Potential Downsides**

While generally safe, fish oil can have a few downsides:

* **Fishy Aftertaste & Bad Breath:** Taking it with food usually helps.
* **Increased Bleeding Risk:** Avoid if you're on blood thinners.
* **Potential Drug Interactions:** Check with your doctor if you take any medications.
* **Quality Concerns:** Choose high-quality supplements from reputable brands to minimize exposure to contaminants.

**Key Takeaways**

* Fish oil acts as a natural blood thinner, promoting cardiovascular health.
* It offers a wide array of benefits, from brain health to glowing skin.
* Consult your doctor before taking fish oil, especially if you're on medication.
* Choose high-quality supplements and consider taking them with food.

**Incorporating fish oil into your routine can be a simple yet powerful step towards a healthier you. Remember, always talk to your doctor first to ensure it's the right choice for you.**

## What are the benefits of insulin beyond glucose regulation, and how does it support metabolic health and manage certain conditions?

The main reason why the keto diet and intermittent fasting work so well to support a healthy body is that they both help lower insulin. However, insulin has certain benefits. This is where the confusion starts. How can insulin be harmful and also have health benefits?

**Potential health benefits of insulin:**

• It helps lower blood sugar levels

• It supports muscle growth

• It protects against muscle atrophy

• It supports the arteries

• It helps lower LDL cholesterol

• It helps lower blood pressure

• It lowers the production of glucose in the liver

• It supports the absorption of potassium and magnesium

• It suppresses lipolysis

• It is a potent anti-inflammatory

• It has antioxidant properties

• Insulin nasal spray is used to help people who have dementia

• It helps increases testosterone

• It helps lower uric acid

The real problem is with the insulin receptors. When the receptors become resistant, as in insulin resistance, we lose the function of insulin. When someone has insulin resistance, they actually have an insulin deficiency. You may have excess insulin in your blood, but it’s not affecting the receptors. A high level of insulin is what creates insulin resistance. The more you increase insulin, the less the receptors will work.

## What are the benefits of mint for digestive issues, and how effective is it in alleviating symptoms such as indigestion, bloating, and nausea?

Mint, celebrated for its flavor and aroma, offers several digestive benefits:

\- Digestive Aid: Menthol in mint stimulates bile secretion and digestive enzymes, enhancing digestion and alleviating issues like constipation and indigestion.

\- Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): Peppermint oil, derived from mint, helps relieve IBS symptoms by relaxing gut muscles and reducing spasms.

\- Abdominal Cramps: Mint’s antispasmodic properties can soothe abdominal cramps and muscle contractions.

\- Bloating and Gas Relief: Warm mint tea can reduce gas and bloating by relaxing intestinal muscles.

Combining mint with fennel seeds, known for their carminative effects, can further enhance digestive health and alleviate symptoms like heartburn and acid reflux.

***

## What are the benefits of nasal breathing, and how does it impact respiratory health and overall well-being?

When you restrict airflow by breathing through the nose, some very interesting things occur. You actually get more oxygen delivered to your tissues when nose breathing than when you breathe through your mouth.

**When you breathe through your nose, the sinuses help moisten the air as it goes into the lungs. This protects the lungs from irritation and inflammation. Your nose also helps filter the air as it goes into the lungs and can protect the lungs against pathogens.**

CO2 isn’t just a waste product. It’s essential. It takes CO2 to push oxygen from your blood into your cells. A few potential side effects of sinus surgery are dry sinuses and difficulty breathing. You need the mucous membranes to balance out oxygen and CO2. Oxygen therapy and certain conditions can also cause low CO2.

**Low CO2** can cause the body to be more alkaline, which can cause low calcium in the blood. Both of these issues can lead to a myriad of symptoms. When you breathe through your nose, you can increase the amount of oxygen in your cells by about 20%. Nose breathing helps increase the right amount of CO2 in your body to push oxygen into your cells. This will help oxygenate your brain and muscles, especially when you sleep and exercise. Increasing the oxygen in your cells can also help with stress.

## What are the benefits of Niacin and how to fix Niacin deficiency?

**Benefits of Niacin:** Niacin is a precursor to NAD, which helps extract electrons from foods. This allows you to get more energy from the food that you eat. Vitamin B3 helps support something known as sirtuins, which support longevity and DNA repair. L-tryptophan can convert to niacin, serotonin, and melatonin! Niacin is very beneficial for skin health and conditions like acne and psoriasis. A niacin deficiency can cause very dry, scaly skin. The form of niacin known as niacinamide can help with inflammatory conditions like arthritis. Niacin also supports healthy levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol. It was very popular before the development of statins.

**Where to get it:** Animal protein and organ meats are the best sources of niacin. You can also get niacin from spirulina and nutritional yeast, but look for nutritional yeast that does not have added synthetic vitamins. There is a tremendous amount of research on niacin and cholesterol, the heart, and mood disorders like schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder.

## What are the benefits of rice water for hair?

Rice water contains B vitamins and amino acids essential for the hair. Fermented rice water contains pitera, a byproduct of fermentation often used in skin care. Pitera helps brighten the hair and also helps with dandruff and itchiness. Fermented rice water contains lactic acid, which decreases dullness and frizziness. It also contains magnesium and selenium. Fermented rice water increases nitric oxide, which helps bring oxygen to the hair's root.

To make fermented rice water, combine 2 cups of organic rice in a bowl with 4 cups of water. Massage the rice with water and drain. Add 2 cups of water to the wet rice and allow the mixture to sit at room temperature for 2 hours. Strain the liquid into a glass jar and cover lightly. After 48 hours, cover your fermented rice water with a lid and store it in the refrigerator. The cold temperature will slow down bacterial growth. To use fermented rice water for your hair, apply it to your hair and scalp, leave it on for 20 minutes, and then rinse. Do this twice per week for hair growth and healthier hair. Fermented rice water helps repair the hair and puts beneficial microbes back into the hair. It can also be used on your face!

## What are the benefits of sea kelp?

**These are the 7 health benefits of the iodine in sea kelp:**

1\. Helps balance estrogen. If a woman is estrogen dominant she may develop ovarian cysts or fibrocystic breasts.

2\. Enhances your IQ (your cognitive performance), especially in a growing child. If you’re pregnant, take sea kelp to reduce the chance of the baby’s brain being smaller. Iodine can also enhance your growth in general.

3\. Contains ten times more calcium than milk. We all know the problems with milk from a commercial dairy, with added hormones and the low quality of food that cows eat.

4\. Sea kelp has many more nutrients such as magnesium, potassium, iron, zinc, vitamin C, and B vitamins

5\. Contains the phytochemical fucoidan, which has powerful anti-cancer properties. It’s an antioxidant and has anti-inflammatory properties too.

6\. Contains vanadium, a trace mineral that helps control your blood sugars and address insulin resistance. (Sea kelp contains all trace minerals, but iodine seems to be the most concentrated.)

7\. Contains amino acids, although a fairly small amount so you’d have to consume large quantities to reap the benefits. Just be aware there are amino acids in seaweed.

## What are the benefits of sodium bicarbonate?

Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. Your body actually makes sodium bicarbonate. Different parts of the body have different pH levels. Even different parts of your digestive tract require different pH levels. Sodium bicarbonate helps decrease the acid in your small intestine, which increases the pH and supports important digestive enzymes. If I needed to take enzymes, I would also take baking soda to help activate the enzymes. Baking soda may also be helpful in certain cases for people with acid reflux or heartburn. However, it shouldn’t be taken often or over a long period of time. If someone has an ulcer or gastritis, betaine hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar will cause irritation. In these situations, baking soda might provide some relief.

## What are the benefits of taking cod liver oil, and why might it be a valuable addition to your health regimen?

**Cod liver oil is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. EPA has potent anti-inflammatory properties, while DHA supports cognitive function. Cod liver oil is also rich in vitamin A and vitamin D.**

**Don’t confuse cod liver oil with fish oil!** You would need 12,000 mg of fish oil to equal just one tablespoon of cod liver oil. You can not get vitamin A from fruits and vegetables. Beta-carotene is only a precursor to vitamin A, not the active form. Cod liver oil contains retinol, the active form of vitamin A.

The most common autoimmune disease is Hashimoto’s hypothyroidism. There’s a significant link between vitamin A deficiency and hypothyroidism.

**There are vitamin A receptors inside of your white blood cells, so it’s crucial for immunity! Vitamin A also helps to regulate iodine.**

**Vitamin A supports the mucus membranes of your mouth, sinuses, throat, and lungs, so it’s critical in preventing infections.** It also supports the roots of the microvilli on the inside of your intestinal tract. Vitamin A supports the health of your retina. If you’re deficient in retinol (the active form of vitamin A), you can go blind.

**Cod liver oil is also a good source of vitamin D.** Without vitamin D, you can't pull calcium and magnesium into the body. Beans, legumes, grains, and cereals are very high in phytic acid, which increases the need for vitamin D. If your diet is high in these foods, it’s easy to become deficient in vitamin D.

## What are the best methods for detoxifying heavy metals, and how do they support toxin removal and overall health?

Unfortunately, our environment is very polluted, and we are bathed in toxins on a daily basis. Heavy metals are one type of these toxins. Today we're going to talk about the best strategy for detoxifying heavy metals.

Heavy metals can accumulate in our tissues and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Heavy metal poisoning can affect different parts of the body, including the heart, digestive system, neurons, red blood cells, and certain proteins. Exposure to heavy metals also creates a lot of free radicals and oxidation and forces our antioxidants to work harder. Heavy metals even block our endogenous antioxidants.

Our bodies have a very powerful detoxification system, but heavy metals block this important system. While you can avoid heavy metals to a certain degree, you really need to strengthen your detox enzymes: glutathione and SOD. These enzymes help break down chemicals and help prevent oxidation and free-radical damage.

**The best foods to support heavy metal detoxification:**

1\. Sulforaphane (broccoli sprouts or broccoli microgreens)

2\. Cilantro

3\. Allicin (garlic)

4\. Curcumin (turmeric)

5\. Cruciferous vegetables

**Two of the best ways to avoid heavy metals:**

1\. Consume organic foods

2\. Get a water filter

## What are the differences between water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins, and how do these differences affect their absorption, storage, and utilization in the body?

**Optimizing Vitamin Absorption**

The way you take your vitamins can affect their absorption. Vitamins are either fat-soluble or water-soluble:

**Fat-Soluble Vitamins**

Vitamins A, D, E, K1, and K2 require dietary fat for optimal absorption. Consuming these vitamins with a fat-containing meal can enhance their absorption. For example, vitamin D absorption increased by up to 32% when taken with fat, as noted in the _Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics_.

**Water-Soluble Vitamins**

Vitamins C and the B-complex vitamins do not require fat for absorption and are effective even on an empty stomach. However, since these vitamins are not stored in the body, regular intake is necessary. The National Institutes of Health notes that up to 90% of vitamin C can be absorbed when taken in doses of 180 mg or less daily.

## What are the five main causes of bloating, and what strategies can quickly alleviate it?

Bloating can be a frustrating and uncomfortable experience. It can be caused by various factors, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact trigger. This post explores different causes of bloating, from dietary changes to issues within your digestive system, and provides insights on how to identify and manage them.

**Understanding Bloating Causes**

* **Recent Dietary Changes:** Consider if bloating coincided with new foods or dietary habits, such as incorporating keto snacks, salads, cruciferous vegetables, dairy products, or sugar alcohols.
* **Stomach Issues:** Inadequate stomach acid or an overly alkaline pH can cause indigestion, acid reflux, and bloating. Consider Betaine Hydrochloride supplements or apple cider vinegar to support stomach acid production.
* **Gallbladder Problems:** A sluggish gallbladder or inadequate bile production can disrupt fat digestion and cause bloating. Gentle massage under the right ribcage and bile salt supplements might help. Consult a healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment.
* **Pancreatic Insufficiency:** Insufficient pancreatic enzymes can lead to diarrhea, floating stools, and bloating. Reduce carbohydrate intake and consider enzyme supplements.
* **Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO):** This condition can cause fermentation in the small intestine, leading to bloating, gas, and stomach pain. A temporary carnivore diet, antibacterial herbs, and fasting might help.
* **Large Intestine Imbalance:** Bloating can result from fermentation in the large intestine. Consuming probiotic-rich foods and increasing vegetable intake can promote microbial diversity and ease discomfort.
* **Stress:** High stress levels can trigger cortisol release, leading to inflammation and bloating. Stress management techniques like spending time outdoors and relaxation exercises can be beneficial.

**Other Bloating Triggers**

* **Overeating**
* **Eating too quickly**
* **Carbonated beverages**
* **Food intolerances (lactose, gluten)**
* **High-fiber foods**
* **Artificial sweeteners**
* **Iron-fortified cereals**

**Key Takeaway**

Understanding the potential causes of bloating and making informed dietary and lifestyle changes can lead to significant relief. Remember, consult a healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.

## What are the health and mental benefits of forest bathing?

Forest bathing was used in Japan in the 1980s for physical and mental health. It’s about getting out in nature and taking in the forest atmosphere.

This is not about taking a bath in the forest. This is about being out in the forest, breathing in certain chemicals or essential oils from the trees. There seems to be a very interesting immune benefit from being exposed to certain essential oils emitted by the trees in a forest. The group of compounds we’re talking about is called phytoncides.

This chemical could significantly increase your natural killer cells. The natural killer cells are part of the innate immune system, and they do several things for your body. They will actually punch a hole into cells that have been infected by viruses and destroy the cell and the virus inside of it.

Different studies have also found that diffusing essential oils with the same chemical in the air of your home could provide benefits.

Forest bathing could potentially provide not only immune benefits but stress-lowering effects as well. It’s incredibly important to do what you can to strengthen your immune system. This could be a fantastic, natural and inexpensive way to do it.

## What are the health benefits and nutritional advantages of incorporating lemon into the diet?

Lemon is a fruit that has many different benefits for our bodies. It contains citric acid, which is a very strong type of acid. One interesting thing about lemon juice is that as soon as you consume it, it gets burned up in the body and turns alkaline.

It should be noted that it can help prevent uric acid stones, as well as help with acidosis. Lemon juice won’t alkalize the blood or body, but it will alkalize the urine.

**Benefits**

* May help decrease the risk of kidney stones
* High in vitamin C
* Helps with acidosis
* Can help reduce the risk of gout
* Has the highest concentrates of citrates of any food
* Helps to alkalize the body
* Low in fructose

**How to consume it**

If you’re doing fasting or keto, mix some lemon (about 1 oz) in water and drink that to help minimize acidosis and some of the symptoms of it.

You can also consume lemon juice. Make sure it is organic and not pasteurized—also that it doesn’t contain sugar.

## What are the health benefits associated with adequate iodine intake?

Iodine is a trace mineral (one of the minerals needed in small amounts) that is involved in many different health processes. Thirty percent of the body’s iodine is stored in the thyroid gland (it is concentrated there) and the thyroid uses iodine to make its hormones, so when you see “T4” and “T3,” the numbers 3 and 4 represent the number of iodine molecules in each hormone. In the body T4 gets converted to T3. T4 is an inactive form of thyroid; T3 is the active form of thyroid and one is converted to the other through the liver and the kidney.

Globally, there are 1,572 million people at risk for having an iodine deficiency.

**Benefits**

* Supports your thyroid
* Supports cognitive function
* Boosts healthy weight loss and digestion
* Supports the reproductive system
* Balances estrogen ratios
* Topical iodine is good to remove skin tags and warts

**Symptoms of an iodine deficiency**

* Slow metabolic rate
* Fatigue
* Weakness
* Hair loss
* Dry skin
* Feeling cold
* Trouble learning
* Lower IQ
* Higher estrogen

**Causes of iodine deficiency**

* Fluoride (in tap water) blocking the absorption of iodine
* Bromate in flour products
* Grains
* Our soils don’t have the microbes to mobilize these trace minerals, so a lot of foods don’t have iodine anymore
* Consuming too many cruciferous vegetables (but you would have to consume a tremendous amount of them over a long period of time)

**How to consume it**

Follow the directions in the label to prevent iodine toxicity. Too much iodine can cause some side effects and can be toxic to your body.

If you have skin tags and warts you can put a drop of iodine on the skin tag and continue to do this for several days in a row. You may also want to put a little bandaid over it. You can do the same thing for a wart.

**Where to get it**

You can get it from the health food store or pharmacy, or order it online.

One of the best sources of iodine is called sea kelp. It has other beneficial nutrients in addition to iodine, like selenium. If you get sea kelp, it’s best to get it from a very clean and pristine part of the world. Organic Icelandic sea kelp is a fantastic choice.

You can also get Dr. Berg’s Sea Kelp Enhanced, which has a lot of benefits in addition to iodine.

## What are the health benefits of alpha-lipoic acid, and how does it affect different bodily functions?

Your body makes alpha lipoic acid, you can get it as a supplement, and it’s in foods like red meat and certain vegetables. When you take alpha lipoic acid as a supplement, you’re getting a lot more of it—like 1000x more than your body can make.

Alpha lipoic acid is a very powerful antioxidant. If you’re a diabetic, alpha lipoic acid can protect the tissues from that. It can also help with damage within the mitochondria. Alpha lipoic acid acts as a sponge to soak up free-radicals and protect against oxidation.

Alpha lipoic acid can act as a chelator to help detoxify mercury from the body, which can also produce oxidation. Alpha lipoic acid is also a lipid antioxidant, so it’s good for areas of the body that are lined with lipids (like your nerves).

**More alpha lipoic acid benefits:**

• It’s good for diabetic neuropathy

• It counters oxidation and free radicals

• It crosses the blood-brain barrier

• It protects the myelin sheath

• It helps mitochondria make more energy

• It lowers A1C

## What are the health benefits of beets, and how do their compounds contribute to these effects?

Beets are a nutritional powerhouse that deserve a regular spot in your diet. They're not only keto-friendly, but also offer a wealth of health benefits.

**Beets: A Keto-Friendly Superfood**

Contrary to popular belief, beets are perfectly compatible with the keto diet. Their high fiber content balances out the carbs, making them a great choice for those watching their insulin and blood sugar levels. Just remember, beet juice is not keto-friendly due to its lack of fiber.

**Nutritional Benefits**

Beets are low in net carbs and calories, yet packed with essential nutrients. They're an excellent source of vitamin C, vitamin B6, folate, potassium, manganese, and copper. Beets also contain unique betalains, plant chemicals with impressive health-boosting properties.

**Five Reasons to Eat Beets Regularly**

1. **Support Healthy Blood Pressure:** Beets' high nitrate content converts to nitric oxide, a vasodilator that widens blood vessels, improving blood flow and reducing blood pressure. This significantly lowers the risk of stroke and heart disease.
2. **Promote Eye Health:** Beet greens are rich in carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin, which protect your eyes from oxidative damage and safeguard retinal cells from UV light. This promotes retinal health and reduces the risk of age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma.
3. **Support Detoxification:** Beets are a top source of betalains, which promote the release of enzymes needed for detoxification. Betalains also help balance blood lipid levels and may benefit those with fatty liver disease.
4. **Combat Inflammation:** Beets are packed with anti-inflammatory nutrients like betalains, carotenoids, and phytochemicals. This helps reduce chronic inflammation, a major contributor to many diseases like cancer, heart disease, and arthritis.
5. **Lower Cancer Risk:** Beets contain compounds that may lower the risk of several cancers, including prostate, breast, liver, and stomach cancer. Their high folate content also protects DNA from damage, reducing the risk of mutations and cancer development.

**Incorporating Beets into Your Diet**

Beets are a versatile ingredient that you can enjoy in various ways:

* **Raw:** Grate them into salads or slaw for a crunchy, refreshing addition.
* **Pickled:** Pickled beets add a tangy flavor to salads and sandwiches.
* **Roasted:** Roasting enhances their natural sweetness and brings out their earthy flavor.
* **Steamed:** Steaming beets preserves their nutrients and makes them tender and easy to eat.

Remember, beets are not just a delicious addition to your meals; they're a nutritional powerhouse that can significantly benefit your overall health. So, next time you're at the grocery store, don't forget to grab a bunch of beets and enjoy their numerous health benefits.

***

## What are the health benefits of dietary fiber?

Fiber is a carbohydrate, but it has no effect on blood sugar or insulin. It is low on the glycemic index. It feeds the microbes, the bacteria in the gut, and the microbes give back butyrate (or butyric acid) that then feeds the colon cells energy. Butyrate also helps with blood sugars and can help lower insulin indirectly.

The problem with fiber is that it can cause fluid retention. Certain fibers tend to gel and expand in your gut. It can actually feel like your belly is swelling, as if you’ve gained fat, but actually it is just water weight.

**Benefits**

1. Zero effect on insulin
2. Contains phytonutrients (healthy substances found in plants), vitamins and minerals
3. Binds to bile and helps regulate the amount of bile in the body
4. Can help feed the microflora
5. Contains small-chain fatty acids
6. May help regulate pH
7. May help regulate lipids
8. May have anticancer effects
9. Can help buffer the blood sugar response to a meal

**When not to consume fiber**

1. Diverticulitis
2. Constipation
3. Bloating
4. Abdominal pain
5. IBS
6. Food allergies
7. SIBO
8. Hemorrhoids
9. Rectal bleeding
10. Bloating

**Where to get it**

Get your fiber from vegetables and not grains. Grains are a problem due to a higher glycemic index and gluten content, and because they have phytic acid which prevents nutrient absorption. Microbes live off your fiber as their food, so vegetable fiber is the best fiber to consume.

## What are the health benefits of selenium, and how do its antioxidant properties support immune function and thyroid health?

Selenium is a trace mineral, and it’s involved in thyroid function and helps detox mercury. Selenium is also a powerful antioxidant. It’s important to support cardiovascular and brain health and may help prevent strokes and cancer. Brazil nuts are loaded with selenium. One Brazil nut will give you the selenium you need for the day. Taking too much selenium could lead to selenium toxicity. Selenium is in many other foods, too, so why are so many people deficient in selenium? It has to do with the fact that it’s in a form that plant roots have a difficult time extracting—they need help from microbes. However, there aren’t enough microbes or diversity of microbes in the soil. A good solution is to start buying foods from farmers who care about their soil and grow things with microbial diversity. It’s also essential to consume fermented foods. Another overlooked cause of selenium deficiency is a certain genetic mutation related to the proteins or enzymes with selenium. Taking statins may also lead to selenium deficiency.

## What are the health effects of degraded omega-3 fatty acids, and how can their degradation impact overall well-being?

Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for maintaining optimal health, supporting brain function, and reducing inflammation. However, omega-3s in oils like canola can degrade when exposed to high heat during processing, reducing their benefits.

**Key Health Impacts**

\- Inflammation: Degraded omega-3s disrupt the balance with omega-6 fatty acids, promoting inflammation. This can worsen conditions like arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.

\- Oxidative Stress: Degraded omega-3s can lead to oxidative stress, increasing the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular issues and type 2 diabetes.

\- Cognitive Function: Omega-3s are crucial for brain health. When degraded, they may not provide the same mental benefits, potentially increasing the risk of neurological issues.

**Alternative Oil Choices**

To minimize the risk of consuming degraded omega-3s, consider using oils like olive oil or coconut oil, which are less likely to degrade under high heat and do not contain trans fats.

**Concerns About Canola Oil**

While the European Union's food safety authority considers canola oil safe, concerns remain about its high erucic acid content, especially in genetically modified crops designed to reduce this acid. This has raised concerns among European consumers and farmers.

## What are the heart-healthy fats found in olives, and how do they contribute to cardiovascular health?

Olives are rich in healthy monounsaturated fats (MUFAs), especially oleic acid, which provides numerous health benefits, particularly for the heart.

**Oleic Acid and Anti-Inflammatory Properties**

Oleic acid, an omega-9 fatty acid, has potent anti-inflammatory effects. It helps combat chronic inflammation, which is linked to diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Research shows oleic acid can suppress cancer-related genes and enhance the effectiveness of certain cancer treatments.

**Monounsaturated Fats for Heart Health**

MUFAs in olives help improve cholesterol levels by lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol and increasing HDL (good) cholesterol, reducing heart disease risk. A study in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a diet rich in MUFAs from olive oil significantly reduced heart disease risk.

**Low-Carb Benefits**

Olives are low in carbohydrates, making them an excellent snack for low-carb or ketogenic diets.

Incorporating olives into your diet supports heart health, reduces inflammation, and fits well with low-carb eating plans.

## What are the key benefits of fish oil for heart health, and how do its omega-3s support heart function, reduce inflammation, and prevent disease?

**Health benefits of fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids):**

• They are antiarrhythmic

• They are anti-inflammatory

• They trigger genes that can help turn off the fibrosis effect of the heart

• They are antithrombotic

• They support the endothelial layer in the arteries

• They can help make your cell membranes more fluid and less rigid

Omega-6 fatty acids are common in oils like vegetable oils and seed oils. These oils invade cell membranes and make them more rigid. It’s crucial to have the correct ratio of omega-3 fatty acids to omega-6 fatty acids, which should be 1:1. The average person in the US has a 15:1 ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids not only increase the risk of heart problems but many other health issues. Omega-6 fatty acids also compete with omega-3 fatty acids. So keep in mind that the more omega-6 fatty acids you have in your diet, the less of an effect you will have from omega-3 fatty acids.

## What are the key benefits of NAC?

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a modified form of the amino acid cysteine, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing protein structures within the body.

We don't have a specific brand recommendation or dosage for NAC from Dr. Berg, but we do have information about NAC and best practices for buying it.

Key Benefits of NAC:

NAC offers a wide range of potential health benefits, including:

* Liver Support: It can help mitigate liver damage caused by substances like alcohol and acetaminophen (Tylenol), and is even used in emergency settings for overdose.
* Respiratory Health: NAC is known for its ability to reduce excessive mucus, fluid, and inflammation in the lungs, which can be beneficial for managing conditions like COPD.
* Neurological and Mental Health: NAC may help normalize neurotransmitters, potentially assisting with symptoms related to autism, addiction (including food, drug, and alcohol addiction), depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. It may also help limit the toxicity associated with certain ADHD medications.
* Skin Health: Some evidence suggests NAC can help reduce acne and acne scars.
* Antioxidant Support: A significant function of NAC is its ability to boost the production of glutathione, a powerful antioxidant.

## What are the key benefits of UV radiation, and how does it aid vitamin D synthesis, skin health, and therapeutic uses?

Many people think they need to avoid ultraviolet radiation—their first thought may even be that it causes cancer. Today we're going to talk about the potent anti-inflammatory effects of UV radiation and its other benefits. UV radiation is a part of the spectrum of energy from the sun. Humans have adapted over time to survive the sun's radiation and use it to our advantage.

Ultraviolet radiation is the only part of the sun's energy that helps the body make vitamin D, which is essential. Vitamin D is one of the most important vitamins for your immune system and is an incredibly potent anti-inflammatory. While chronic exposure to UV radiation is unhealthy and can increase your risk of certain skin cancers, it may have significant health benefits in small doses.

Too much exposure to ultraviolet radiation can also cause wrinkles, loss of collagen, and aging spots. But having enough antioxidants in your skin may help protect you from these issues. If you build up the antioxidants in your skin—in small doses, the benefits of ultraviolet radiation may outweigh the negatives.

**Potential benefits of UV radiation:**

• It has an anti-inflammatory effect

• It may contribute to decreasing your risk of autoimmune diseases

• It may help reduce the risk of TB

• It may help suppress the symptoms of certain skin conditions

• It may help reduce pain

• It may help regulate cortisol

• It can help increase nitric oxide

• It has reparative actions

• It may help elevate your mood and balance serotonin

## What are the key benefits of Vitamin B12 for overall health, including its role in energy production, neurological function, and red blood cell formation?

Vitamin B12 is an essential B vitamin that you have to get from your diet. Vitamin B12 basically makes the foundation of red blood cells, white blood cells and myelin. Myelin is the outer covering of your nervous system. When you lose myelin, you can get all sorts of electrical problems, pain problems, and nerve problems.

Taking potassium for a long period of time could deplete B12, especially if you aren’t consuming enough B12 in your diet. If you increase B12 by taking it as a supplement, you can decrease your potassium reserves.

**Benefits**

* Involved in production of red blood cells
* Involved in production of white blood cells
* Involved in brain functions / nerve functions
* Involved in creation of DNA
* Supports your nervous system by helping to produce myelin

**Symptoms of deficiency**

* Fatigue
* Paleness
* Memory problems
* Neurological issues
* Anemia
* Depression
* Paranoia
* Delusions
* Dementia
* Pins/needles and numbness in the body
* Swollen tongue
* Tremors
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Rash
* Headaches
* Dizziness
* Joint pain

**Causes of deficiency**

Most vitamin B12 deficiencies are not caused by a lack of vitamin B12 in the diet, but rather a lack of absorption because the stomach is not acidic enough. A lot of people have a problem with the pH of the stomach.

Here are the main causes of B12 deficiency:

* Low stomach acid
* Acid reflux
* GERD
* Gas
* Bloating
* Atrophic gastritis (take Zypan to treat it)
* Past stomach surgery
* Metformin
* Vegan (although vegans can get B12 from wheatgrass juice powder)

**Synthetic and natural version of vitamin B12**

The synthetic version of vitamin B12 is called cyanocobalamin. The natural version of vitamin B12 is called methylcobalamin.

The main reason why people get synthetic vitamin B12 is that it’s cheaper. In many cases, on the label of synthetic vitamin B12, it will say something like 5000%. But more is not always better. The reason why it’s 5000% is that it takes so much of it to be absorbed.

**How to consume it**

Add vitamin B12-rich foods to your diet. If you consume it in a supplement form, follow the directions on the label for the proper dosage.

If you are deficient in vitamin B12, apple cider vinegar may help with this situation. You could try adding apple cider vinegar in some water and drink it. You may not even need to take more B12 because doing this to acidify your stomach could help with the absorption of the B12 in your diet. Sea salt, potassium, and iodine could also help build up your stomach acid and help with absorption.

It’s recommended that you consume 1000 mcg to 3000 mcg of methylcobalamin (B12) daily to counter B12 deficiency symptoms.

Cyanocobalamin (synthetic B12):

* Not easily absorbed
* Splits off into cyanide

Methylcobalamin (natural B12):

* Bonds to protein (needs stomach acid to break it down)
* Most animal products are filled with it

**Where to get it**

* You can get it from a methylcobalamin supplement. Or from food sources. Here is the list of B12-rich foods:
* Animal liver and kidney
* Clams
* Sardines
* Beef
* Tuna
* Nutritional yeast
* Trout
* Salmon
* Fortified non-dairy milk
* Dairy
* Eggs

If you are vegan, there are 3 primary sources of B12:

* Chlorella (best vegan source)
* Nori (red algae) • Spirulina

## What are the key benefits of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) for energy metabolism, skin health, and hormone production?

The name of the B5 vitamin is pantothenic acid and it is a cofactor of energy metabolism, specifically for the enzymes that help you break down fat. When you are converting from sugar- burning to ketosis by burning fat, you need vitamin B5 big-time.

The Greek word for this vitamin is “Pantothen” which means “from all quarters” indicating that it is very easy to get from all your foods. When you read about this vitamin you are going to find that it is almost impossible to be deficient in it, because it is everywhere, but actually a lot of people are deficient in it.

B5 allows macronutrients (fats, carbs, protein) to be converted to energy.

**Benefits**

* Vitamin B5 is needed to support enzymes for energy metabolism from carbs, protein and especially fat
* Supports during keto adaptation
* Supports the production of melatonin (sleep hormone)
* Supports the production of acetylcholine (to help you feel awake during the day)
* Is a key nutrient for adrenal function
* Is needed to make cortisol

**Symptoms of deficiency**

* Stress
* Neuro pain
* Inflammation
* Insomnia
* Keto fatigue

**Where to get it**

Typically, B5 is in our foods, but if your gut flora, the friendly bacteria, are incomplete, there will be fewer B vitamins made. Your gut flora also need vitamin D3 to function and low D3 will lessen the number you have of these microorganisms, which are needed to make B5—leading to a deficiency.

**Best foods for vitamin B5:**

• Mushrooms

• Liver

• Avocados

• Cauliflower

• Eggs

***

## What are the key benefits of vitamin C, and how does it support immune function and antioxidant activity?

Heart attacks are the number one cause of death worldwide, so it makes sense to discover the cardiovascular health benefits of vitamin C. There’s a condition called atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. Sometimes people believe it’s caused by consuming too much cholesterol, but it’s not. Your body makes its own cholesterol in large amounts. It may show up to heal damage to a blood vessel, but it’s not the cause.

The cause of damage to an artery is structure weakness in the blood vessel itself. The innermost lining of the artery has what are called endothelial cells composed of collagen, and they need vitamin C to stay strong. Vitamin C is a cofactor for collagen production and vascular smooth muscle. You have muscles around your arteries that help them contract and relax, so it’s critical to maintain their elasticity. Yet, for example, insulin can cause your arteries to thicken and harden.

High insulin, which causes insulin resistance, is one of the key factors that causes vitamin C deficiency. There are nearly 500 clinical trials showing that vitamin C supplementation leads to an improvement in endothelial function. If the arterial wall gets damaged, your body sends cholesterol, calcium, and protein to repair the damage by forming a clot. Vitamin C also helps keep the clot from breaking off and causing a stroke or heart attack.

Classic signs of vitamin C deficiency are scurvy and fragile blood vessels. How do you become deficient? Well, by developing insulin resistance, and poor eating habits; specifically not eating enough vegetables, smoking, taking medications, and drinking alcohol.

I urge you to consume foods high in vitamin C, including bell peppers, cabbage, sauerkraut, and leafy greens. Nearly all vegetables have vitamin C.

Now you know the cardiovascular health benefits of vitamin C!

## What are the key nutritional benefits of fiber, and how does it contribute to overall health and digestive function?

When I’m talking about fiber, I’m talking about vegetable fiber, not grain fibers, like bran, for example. On the healthy keto diet, I believe it’s important that a person consumes a lot of vegetables as a part of the healthy keto lifestyle. But, there are times that a person wouldn’t want to consume large amounts of vegetables, for example, if they have SIBO.

**10 benefits of fiber:**

1\. It has zero effect on insulin

2\. It contains phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals

3\. It binds to bile and helps regulate the amount of bile in the body

4\. It can help feed the microflora

5\. Small-chain fatty acids (blood sugar control and more)

6\. It may help regulate pH

7\. It may help regulate transit time

8\. It may help regulate lipids

9\. It may have anti-cancer effects

10\. It can help buffer the blood sugar response

***

## What are the key physiological functions and benefits of bile salts in digestion and nutrient absorption?

The gallbladder is very important. It helps you store and concentrate bile salts. Your liver and friendly bacteria also make bile. About 95-97% of all the bile the body makes is actually recycled.

Typically, when people take bile salts as a supplement, they take them with a meal or just after they eat. Bile salts can help with bloating, belching, burping, and nausea. The primary function of bile salts that most people know of is the extraction of fat-soluble vitamins from the fat in your diet. However, there are many other benefits of purified bile salts. There are also benefits of taking them on an empty stomach.

For the benefits of bile salts below, I believe it may be best to take them on an empty stomach. I would take one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

**9 potential benefits of purified bile salts:**

1\. Bile salts can help decrease the risk of gallstones

2\. Bile salts can help you extract fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, D, and K) and omega-3 fatty acids

3\. Bile salts can help with constipation

4\. Bile salts can help you convert thyroid hormones

5\. Bile salts can act as a VDR agonist

6\. Bile salts can help decrease pain

7\. Bile salts can help reduce the risk of SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth)

8\. Bile salts can help reduce liver inflammation

9\. Biles salts can help reduce the toxic load and help regulate excess cholesterol

## What are the key signs of zinc deficiency, and how can early recognition help manage it?

**Zinc: The Unsung Hero of Your Health**

Zinc, often overlooked, is actually the third most crucial nutrient for your body, playing a role in over 200 enzyme functions. It's vital for producing glutathione, your body's most potent antioxidant, and it's highly concentrated in the prostate, aiding in sperm and testosterone production. Zinc is also crucial for insulin production in the pancreas and memory function in the hippocampus. From wound healing and collagen production to hair regrowth and reducing gastritis, zinc is truly a powerhouse nutrient.

**Zinc Deficiency: Watch Out for These 7 Signs**

1. Night blindness
2. Low testosterone, estrogen, or progesterone
3. Diarrhea
4. Acne
5. Alopecia (hair loss)
6. Cataracts
7. Thymus gland shrinkage

**The Thymus Connection: Zinc and Longevity**

The thymus, a key immune gland responsible for producing infection-fighting T cells, is highly dependent on zinc. Research by Professor Greg Fahy suggests that restoring the thymus gland could have profound anti-aging effects, potentially increasing lifespan by reducing cancer and infection risks. Studies in rats have shown that zinc supplementation can lead to full thymus function recovery and improved immunity.

**Causes of Zinc Deficiency:**

* Aging
* Gut issues
* Vegan/vegetarian diets
* Alcohol consumption
* Sugar intake
* Chronic stress
* Certain medications

**Zinc Supplementation: Remember Copper and Thymus Extract**

If you're considering supplementing with zinc it's important to also include copper, as zinc can deplete copper levels. Additionally, thymus extract can provide further support for thymus gland health.

**Key Takeaway:** Don't underestimate the importance of zinc. It's a vital nutrient for countless bodily functions, including immunity, hormone production, and even longevity. Ensure you're getting enough zinc through diet or supplementation to support your overall health and well-being.

## What are the key techniques and approaches for stroke recovery and rehabilitation?

### **Understanding Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Techniques**

[Recovering from a stroke](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-to-do-after-a-stroke-important) is a complex process that requires a personalized approach. There's no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to stroke rehabilitation.

The most effective strategies involve a multifaceted approach that addresses both brain health and motor recovery. Let's explore some key techniques that can help optimize the stroke recovery process.

#### **The Role of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Healing Brain Damage**

[Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-benefits-of-hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy) is a promising treatment for stroke recovery. It involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized chamber, which allows the lungs to gather more oxygen than possible at normal air pressure.

This increased oxygen supply can help heal damaged brain tissue by reducing inflammation, promoting new blood vessels' growth, and stimulating stem cell release.

While more research is needed, HBOT shows potential as a complementary therapy for stroke rehabilitation.

#### **Ketones as an Alternative Fuel for Brain Recovery**

The brain typically relies on glucose for energy, but after a stroke, the brain's ability to use glucose may be impaired. This is where ketones come in.

[Ketones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-t-get-your-ketones-high-enough) are an alternative fuel source for the brain when glucose is unavailable. They can be obtained through a low-carb, high-fat diet, exogenous ketone supplements, [MCT oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-15-benefits-of-mct-or-medium-chain-triglyceride-oil), and intermittent fasting.

By providing the brain with an alternative energy source, ketones may help support brain function and recovery after a stroke.

## What are the main benefits of exercise?

Diet contributes to 85% of your progress with weight loss, and exercise contributes only 15%. But then, there are various benefits of exercise for your weight goal.

The first thing you should know is that all of the benefits of exercise are in recovery after the exercise. The problem is, many people don’t give their bodies enough time to recover. Then, they feel tired and fatigued, and don’t lose weight or gain any strength or stamina.

You must have good sleep and enough recovery time for your body to fully repair. Otherwise, you won’t lose weight and you won’t have any other benefits.

If you don’t feel good after a workout, you’re overtraining. This is not good for the heart. For hard-core workouts, you want to only do them every third day rather than every day. Between these workouts, you can do light exercises like long-distance walks and yoga.

The best formula for exercise is 1 minute of exercise and 5 minutes of rest. Repeat three times to get started, and then increase the number of repetitions. You always want short intervals of intense exercise and a long period of rest.

**Benefits**

* Increases oxygen
* Gives you energy
* Lowers stress
* Increases fitness
* Improves muscle tone
* Good for atrophy
* Increases muscle mass
* Improves blood sugars
* Enhances sleep
* Helps with joint stiffness
* Improves blood flow
* Increases flexibility
* Strengthens the heart
* Enhances cognitive function and mood
* Builds antioxidant reserves

**Exercise time**

The best time to work out is in the evening. When you work out in the evening, you recover much more quickly than if you work out in the morning. You also burn more fat.

Keep in mind that exercising in the evening will spike your cortisol a little bit, but it normalizes much faster. If you are an adrenal body type, you may benefit from walking in the morning. However, for those who are not, high-intensity interval training is ideal in the evening. If you work out twice a day, try doing your light workout in the morning and more intense exercises in the evening. You should see a big difference in your results and recovery when you work out in the evening.

**High intensity interval training (HIIT)**

High-intensity interval training is intermittent exercise. This can help stimulate growth hormone. Doing this high-intensity exercise intermittently is important because it won’t stimulate the opposing hormone: cortisol. It keeps the stress down while still stimulating growth hormone. The growth hormone is stimulated by the high intensity. Cortisol is stimulated by duration, which you’re keeping short.

**Long-distance walking**

Walking is a low-stress, higher-oxygen type of exercise (aerobic), and better for stress. If you have a history of being an athlete or doing a sport that involved lots of cardio, then your cells have developed a larger capacity to use energy and you will need to do regular exercise to release that energy.

**Tips for getting the most out of your workout**

• Get good sleep

• Don’t eat anything before, during or after your workout

• Avoid insulin-spiking foods

## What are the medicinal uses of olive leaf extract, and how does it benefit health through its various properties?

Olive leaf extract, rich in polyphenols, offers numerous health benefits.

**Antiviral Properties**

Oleuropein, the main compound in olive leaf extract, has strong antiviral effects, effective against viruses like the flu and HIV. Studies show oleuropein can inhibit influenza virus replication.

**Allergy Relief**

Olive leaf extract also acts as an antihistamine, reducing allergy symptoms by inhibiting histamine release. Research indicates it significantly reduces hay fever symptoms.

**Olives and the Keto Diet**

Olives are low in carbs and high in healthy fats, making them perfect for a keto diet. They enhance flavor and nutrition in keto-friendly meals, fitting well within the diet's macronutrient profile.

***

## What are the most beneficial foods for mitigating hair loss?

A study has shown that over 90 percent of people suffering from alopecia are deficient in an amino acid called histidine. This essential amino acid is a precursor to histamine, which plays a vital role in immune reactions, allergies, and inflammation.

Deficiencies in histidine can lead to anemia, while excessive intake can cause premature ejaculation. However, the right amount of histidine in your diet can promote healthy hair growth by helping to produce keratin and regulating copper and zinc levels.

Certain medications and alcohol consumption may lower histidine levels in the body, while inadequate stomach acid can hinder its absorption from food sources. To counter this issue, betaine hydrochloride can be taken as an acidifier.

But to fully utilize histidine, specific co-factors must be present, such as vitamin B6, proper copper and zinc ratios, and folate.

The top three foods that can help combat hair loss are:

1\. Organ meats, including liver, due to the histidine and other essential nutrients they contain.

2\. Animal proteins, such as beef and chicken, are rich in histidine and other amino acids necessary for hair regeneration.

3\. Shellfish, particularly shrimp, scallops, and crabs, provide high levels of zinc and copper that can help maintain proper ratios in the body.

It's important to note that having enough folate in your diet is essential for hair development. It's best to obtain folate from natural sources, as taking supplements such as folic acid may inhibit the conversion of histidine into its active form.

## What are the most effective and rapid strategies for detoxifying the liver, and how do various dietary, lifestyle, and supplementation approaches contribute to this process?

**Here are some tips for supporting your liver health:**

To support and speed up liver detoxification, we need to trigger autophagy.

The best ways to trigger autophagy:

1\. Dry fasting (Recommend doing it under medical supervision)

2\. Water fasting

3\. Calorie restriction

4\. Sleep

5\. Exercise

6\. Keto diet

7\. Phytonutrients

Dry fasting (recommended under medical supervision) is one of the most powerful ways to trigger autophagy and truly cleanse the liver cells.

With dry fasting, you don’t consume any food or water. To cleanse the liver, you may want to consider dry fasting for a full day—starting at sunrise and ending at sunset.

The effects of just one day of dry fasting are equivalent to three days of water fasting.

Additional benefits of dry fasting:

• Enhanced immunity

• Liver and kidney support

• Mental clarity

• Decreased inflammation

When the sun sets, you’ll eat your one meal for the day, which should consist of meat and cruciferous vegetables. These foods are also great for cleaning the liver.

Try dry fasting for three days of the month (they don't need to be consecutive) and see how you feel. (recommended that it is done under medical supervision)

Before you start dry fasting, take bile salts or TUDCA, consume beets, or drink apple cider vinegar with water to help thin your bile.

This can help prevent any negative liver detox side effects.

## What are the most effective and scientifically supported strategies for addressing and mitigating Candida overgrowth in the body?

A good portion of the microbes in your gut are fungi, and candida is one type of fungi. Friendly fungi support the body in many different ways. It’s not until we change the environment that our friendly bacteria and fungi live in that they can become a problem. For example, one of the biggest side effects of antibiotics is candida overgrowth.

If the ratio of candida to bacteria is incorrect, this can lead to health issues. But bacteria release certain things to help keep candida in check. If candida does turn unfriendly, you need to know what you can do. One important thing to remember to support a healthy microbiome is to take probiotics if you have to take antibiotics.

**The best candida home remedies:**

1\. Take a probiotic and consume probiotic foods

2\. Avoid sugar and dairy

3\. Avoid carbs (do Healthy Keto®)

4\. Avoid sugar alcohols

5\. Consume capric acid (coconut oil or MCT oil)

6\. Consume vegetable fiber

7\. Consume natural herbal antibiotics (garlic, oregano oil, thyme, sage, or turmeric)

## What are the most effective approaches for alleviating muscle cramps, and how can one address potential underlying causes to achieve long-term relief?

To relieve cramps, increase your intake of magnesium and potassium, as these minerals are essential for muscle relaxation. Sometimes combining magnesium with calcium can enhance the contraction-relaxation cycle. Many find this especially helpful before their menstrual period. Often, cramps occur due to a subclinical magnesium deficiency, which becomes more pronounced during the menstrual cycle. Addressing this can effectively alleviate cramps.

## What are the most effective approaches for managing or eliminating cysts on the kidneys or liver, and how can they address symptoms and support overall organ health?

With the cyst usually the body is trying to encapsulate and contain some toxicity. There's not a lot of data out there on how to reverse cysts. I do know in general when people have cysts and other parts of their body, whether it's external on their knee or other surfaces, I do know there's a couple common things that I've seen. Number one they have insulin resistance, they're doing too many carbs. Number two, they might need more iodine because it could be even fibrocystic breasts, for example. The antidote to that is iodine. Seek help.

## What are the most effective foods for promoting the reversal of diabetes, and how do their nutritional profiles support blood sugar control and overall metabolic health?

To improve blood sugar balance and reverse diabetes, it’s recommended to consume plenty of non-starchy vegetables, grass-fed beef, game meats, wild-caught fish, pasture-raised eggs, and full-fat organic dairy. These foods don’t significantly spike blood sugar levels, which supports weight loss and helps restore cellular sensitivity to insulin.

## What are the most effective foods, supplements, and smoothies for supporting liver detoxification and cleansing?

The liver doesn’t hold or store toxins—it gets rid of toxins. When we’re talking about a liver cleanse, we’re talking about getting rid of fat, inflammation, and scar tissue in the liver. These things weaken the ability of the liver to detox. The liver is the only organ that can completely regenerate, but there is a point of limitation.

Keep in mind that you can get rid of 50 percent of the fat in the liver just by going on a low-carb diet. You don’t need to get on a low-fat diet, but a low-carb diet is crucial. Alcohol consumption can lead to fatty liver disease. But, one of the top causes of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is fructose.

**The best foods for liver detoxification:**

• Cruciferous vegetables

• Beets

• Blueberries

• Organ meats

• Grass-fed beef

• Eggs

• Fatty fish (salmon and sardines)

• Seafood

• Sauerkraut

• Kimchi

• Kefir

• Pickles

**The best shakes and smoothies for liver detoxification:**

1\. One cup of blueberries blended with a couple of handfuls of frozen kale and some water

2\. One to two cups of whole milk kefir blended with one cup of blueberries and water (optional)

**The best drink for liver detoxification:**

1\. Two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with the juice of one lemon (or one blended whole lemon) and 12 ounces of water

**The best supplements for liver detoxification:**

• Milk thistle

• Choline

• Turmeric

• Purified bile salts

• Probiotics

• Tocotrienols

## What are the most effective interventions for addressing iron deficiency anemia?

Iron deficiency anemia is either a case of lowered red blood cells, decreased hemoglobin, or a decreased ability to carry oxygen through the blood.

Iron deficiency symptoms include feeling tired, craving ice, weakness, and shortness of breath. In advanced cases, paleness is also a sign of iron deficiency.

Several things can cause iron deficiency anemia. Blood loss caused by menstruation or trauma, ulcers, parasites, fibroids, cancer, infections, and genetics are all potential causes of iron deficiency. One of the most common causes of iron deficiency is decreased absorption of iron caused by low hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Many people have low stomach acid which causes problems like GERD, acid reflux, and heartburn.

Apple cider vinegar with your meal can increase the absorption of iron and also decrease the negative side effects of low stomach acid. Antacids can worsen the problem by further depleting your stomach acid, making the stomach more alkaline, and decreasing the absorption of iron.

Oxalates found in spinach and Swiss chard can also deplete iron. If your diet is high in grains, you’re probably consuming a lot of phytic acid which can also bind to important minerals and decrease their absorption.

Gastric bypass surgery can cause you to become deficient in iron. This surgery decreases the surface area of the stomach and decreases the absorption of iron and other important minerals. Digestive problems like IBS, Crohn’s, and celiac can also cause you to become deficient in iron.

It can be helpful to add the following iron-rich foods to your diet if you have iron deficiency anemia:

•Clams

•Oysters

•Meat

•Eggs

•Liver (grass-fed)

•Octopus

•Spirulina

## What are the most effective interventions for managing and reducing elevated cortisol levels?

Cortisol is a vital hormone—you need small amounts of it to stay healthy. However, when you have way too much cortisol, you can run into many issues when it comes to your health and body weight. Cortisol is a stress hormone that can add pounds to your belly fat.

Here are six ways to help regulate your cortisol levels.

1\. Lower your body stress levels - Stress accumulates in your body. If you don’t release it, it continues to build up and cause issues throughout your body. Acupressure is a great way to get rid of stress in your body.

2\. Increase your sleep - You need to address both the quality and quantity of your sleep. Stress levels, sleep disorders, and insulin resistance can lead to poor sleep.

3\. Increase your aerobic exercise - Aerobic exercise is great for lowering stress and cortisol. Long walks are great for lowering cortisol.

4\. Take vitamins B1, B5, and D - These nutrients are vital for managing health cortisol and stress levels.

5\. Use adaptogens (herbs) - Adaptogenic herbs can help increase your resistance to stress, thus helping support healthy cortisol levels.

6\. Increase potassium and magnesium intake - These nutrients help activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which lowers the fight-or-flight stress response.

## What are the most effective medical and lifestyle interventions for addressing mitral valve prolapse, particularly in cases where symptoms or complications require treatment?

If you have mitral valve prolapse, your heart valves are not opening and closing correctly.

**Mitral valve prolapse causes floppy, leaky valves that are large and bulging.** This bulging, displaced tissue is called prolapse, which leads to inefficient heart pumping. Mitral valve prolapse symptoms include weakness, fatigue, palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath. It’s often described as idiopathic, which means it has no known cause. Mitral valve prolapse is generally treated with beta-blockers or a calcium channel blocker.

In a double-blind study, 141 subjects with mitral valve prolapse were compared to 40 healthy subjects. Sixty percent of the mitral valve prolapse group had magnesium deficiency compared to only 5% of the healthy subjects.

**Low magnesium leads to high adrenaline.** It also accelerates the aging of the fibroblast cell, which helps you make collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid. As we age, the fibroblast cell is very important for our skin, ligaments, tendons, and valves.

**One of the first signs of magnesium deficiency is tetany.** Surprisingly, 85% of people with mitral valve prolapse have tetany! Don’t just rely on the RDA if you’re deficient in magnesium. Try taking 400 mg 2 to 3 times a day, working up to this amount slowly. Also, ensure you’re getting enough vitamin D. Magnesium won’t work without vitamin D!

**WHAT TO DO**

Avoid sugar and refined carbs because they significantly decrease magnesium. It takes years for a magnesium deficiency to show up and it can take up to a year to correct. Try magnesium glycinate to increase your magnesium levels over time.

## What are the most effective methods and guidelines for utilizing licorice extract to achieve optimal health benefits?

#### **How to Use Licorice Extract for Best Results**

To use licorice extract to fade sunspots, look for a skincare product that contains a high concentration of the ingredient. You can find licorice extract in serums, creams, and even face masks.

Apply the product directly to your sunspots once or twice a day, being careful to avoid the delicate skin around your eyes. You should start to see results within a few days to a few weeks, depending on the severity of your sunspots.

Want to banish dark spots for good? Licorice extract is a great start, but don't stop there. Amp up your skincare routine with vitamin C, kojic acid, and niacinamide – they're like the ultimate dream team for evening out your skin tone.

## What are the most effective methods for boosting and sustaining energy levels throughout the day?

**Not with an energy drink!**

So many people try to bypass the natural, I guess it's homeostasis of the body. Your body's ability to maintain stability from the internal to the external. So you have blood pressure, you have sleep levels, circadian waves, you have temperature, you have blood glucose, you have all these different factors. And if you're trying to get energy artificially, that's a really bad thing. And I think that's kind of forcing your body to try to do things that it's not normally supposed to do. Because you can get energy by doing an energy drink.

So I'm just saying that because so many people are doing the five hour energy drinks and stuff like that. I think the most important thing based on what I know about energy is, you know, number one, your sleep has to be really good.

**Number two, you have to have enough protein.**

**Number three, you have to not go crazy with the carbs.** And really we're dealing with the mitochondrial health. And I have a lot of data on that.

## What are the most effective methods for detoxifying the kidneys from elevated levels of uric acid and oxalates, while also preventing their accumulation?

The kidneys can take a beating and can even regenerate. They are composed of roughly one million tiny filters, which filter your blood. But as you age, you start losing these filters—so it becomes even more important to start eating better and decrease exposure to toxins. The two worst things for your kidneys are sugar and oxalates. It’s crucial to stop consuming sugar and high-carb foods and to start limiting your exposure to high-oxalate foods.

However, consuming cheese or dairy with foods that are high in oxalates, but are otherwise healthy, can help counter kidney damage from oxalates.

The best ways to protect your kidneys:

1\. Consume lemon water every morning

2\. Consume apple cider vinegar mixed in water

3\. Consume 2.5 liters of water a day

4\. Avoid high-oxalate foods or add dairy to high-oxalate foods

5\. Get on the Healthy Keto® diet and do intermittent fasting

6\. Avoid fructose

7\. Avoid consuming high levels of vitamin C

8\. Consume potassium (not for end-stage kidney disease)

9\. Consume plant foods and microgreens

## What are the most effective methods for diminishing acne scars?

If you have scarring from acne, one of the best things you can do is to use vitamin E oil.

When using vitamin E oil for acne scars on your face, you may want to use an organic, hexane-free version of vitamin E oil. Vitamin E can have a significant effect on fibrosis. It may actually help break down scar tissue.

Benefits of vitamin E for the skin:

* It’s a powerful antioxidant
* It’s fat-soluble (it goes into the skin)
* It’s an anti-inflammatory
* It can help break down scar tissue
* It can help with certain wrinkles

To use vitamin E oil for your skin, rub it into the skin for about one or two minutes right before you go to bed every night. Do it for about two or three weeks.

To kick things up a notch, you may want to combine the use of vitamin E oil with the Healthy Keto® diet, intermittent fasting, and periodic prolonged fasting. This combination might give you even better results because consuming a lot of carbs and frequent eating can block the effect of vitamin E and can make the skin age faster.

When you do fasting, especially prolonged fasting, your body goes through autophagy, which is a fantastic anti-aging action. You may want to do prolonged fasting once every two weeks or once a month for at least 72 hours.

## What are the most effective methods for eliminating candida overgrowth, and what steps should be taken to address and prevent it?

**Candida is a fungal infection that typically affects the mouth, private areas, or toenails. Candida often develops after antibiotics destroys the bacteria that keep yeast and fungus at bay.**

The majority of your gut microbiome is bacteria. However, you have a small percentage of yeast, fungus, and friendly candida. When antibiotics wipe out your friendly bacteria, this leaves room for candida overgrowth.

**Some of the symptoms of candida overgrowth include itchiness, burning, fatigue, cracks at the corners of the mouth, and ammonia odor.**

Candida changes your pH, making it more alkaline. Sugar is the primary fuel source of candida.

**Other conditions can lower your immune system and cause candida overgrowth. HIV/AIDS, organ transplants, medications like Prednisone, pregnancy, and excessive sugar consumption can all cause candida.**

**Oftentimes, candida overgrowth is paired with a vitamin D deficiency.** Vitamin D has antifungal properties and is also a broad-spectrum antimicrobial.

**If you have candida, there are three things that you need to do!**

1\. Take 20,000 to 30,000 IU of vitamin D

2\. Remove sugar from the diet

3\. Consume probiotic foods (sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, fermented vegetables)

***

## What are the most effective methods for repairing liver damage caused by alcohol consumption, and how can one support liver health during recovery?

I recommend the herb Milk Thistle which has amazing properties of liver regeneration. The longer-term fix is to get on ketosis and intermittent fasting by consuming lots of cruciferous vegetables.

***

## What are the most effective methods or treatments for dissolving kidney stones, and how do they work to aid in their dissolution and removal?

The most common type of kidney stone is a calcium oxalate stone. In this situation, you have high oxalates and calcium and low citrate.

You may have high oxalates from consuming too many high-oxalate foods. Oxalates are in a lot of foods, including keto-friendly foods. High calcium in the urine can be due to a genetic mutation. Your body makes citrates, which bind with calcium to lessen the amount of free calcium in the body. Free calcium is what can bind to oxalates.

Drinking more fluids during the day is one of the best ways to prevent kidney stones. I suggest drinking at least two and a half liters of fluids per day if you're prone to getting kidney stones. Another great way to prevent kidney stones is to add electrolyte powder containing potassium citrate or magnesium citrate to your water.

## What are the most effective natural approaches for managing and treating autoimmune diseases?

An autoimmune disorder can occur when your immune system starts attacking healthy cells, and it can lead to a lot of damage and inflammation. Many autoimmune disorders start in the gut. Your body has protective mechanisms to keep pathogens from invading the gut. But, pathogens may be allowed to pass through the intestinal barrier if you have intestinal permeability, also known as leaky gut. This can lead to someone developing an autoimmune disease.

There is a certain protein called zonulin that regulates intestinal permeability, and it’s typically elevated in autoimmune diseases or inflammatory diseases. To find the best foods for autoimmune diseases, we need to look for foods that strengthen the intestinal barrier and keep zonulin in check. The number one thing that helps regulate zonulin is your own microbiome—it's crucial to support your microbiome.

**The best foods for autoimmune disorders:**

1\. Probiotic foods (sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, or a probiotic supplement)

2\. Fermented vegetables

3\. Foods high in sulforaphane (broccoli sprouts or a sulforaphane supplement)

4\. Foods high in glutamine (red cabbage, grass-fed beef, eggs, fish)

5\. Foods high in omega-3 fats (cod liver oil, salmon, sardines)

**The most important nutrients for autoimmune conditions:**

1\. Zinc

2\. Vitamin D

3\. Vitamin A

**Things to avoid if you have an autoimmune disorder:**

• Antibiotics

• Glyphosate

• Gluten

• Glucose

• Fructose

• Vegetable oils

• Trans fats

## What are the most effective natural cleansing methods for promoting optimal skin health, and how do they support skin rejuvenation and clarity?

The most effective natural cleanse for your skin focuses on stress reduction, a nutritious low-carb diet like Healthy Keto®, and plenty of probiotic foods to lower inflammation, which can trigger or worsen skin issues. In addition, it’s crucial to avoid alcohol and tobacco and check product labels to identify harsh or potentially harmful ingredients such as parabens, sulfates, or phthalates.

## What are the most effective natural interventions that could potentially reverse or slow down the progression of premature graying of hair?

It’s natural for your hair to turn gray with age. However, many people are getting gray hair way too early. Even though you may have genes that give you the propensity to get gray hair, there are still things you can do to help prevent your hair from graying prematurely.

The pigment in your hair and the enzymes that allow the pigment to occur are both dependent on copper. You could be deficient in copper from not consuming foods high in copper. High levels of stress can also cause a copper deficiency. It’s important to do whatever you can to decrease stress and increase copper to prevent gray hair. It may be best to get the copper you need from foods rich in copper rather than a supplement.

As you age, you accumulate hydrogen peroxide in the hair shaft. Hydrogen peroxide can cause a bleaching effect on the hair. To slow this accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, you can try consuming foods rich in catalase.

**Foods high in copper:**

• Seafood (especially oysters)

• Mushrooms

• Organic, grass-fed beef liver

• Spirulina

**Foods high in catalase:**

• Organic, grass-fed beef liver

• Vegetables (especially cruciferous vegetables)

• Sprouts or microgreens

**Things to avoid:**

• Alcohol

• Smoking

•Junk foods

• Sugar

• Refined carbs

• Low-fat diets

## What are the most effective natural methods for promoting liver detoxification and health?

To naturally support liver detoxification, consider the following strategies:

1\. **Cruciferous Vegetables**: These stimulate detoxification pathways and help break down toxins. Examples include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and kale.

2\. **Citrus Fruits**: Lemons can enhance liver function and support detoxification processes.

3\. **Olive Oil**: Supports liver health and aids in the detoxification process.

4\. **Herbs**: Use milk thistle, stinging nettle root, and dandelion greens to bolster liver function. Bitter vegetables like arugula also support detoxification.

These methods help optimize liver function and support its natural detoxification processes.

## What are the most effective natural methods to enhance testosterone levels?

1\. Increase your cholesterol intake - Do not go on a low-fat diet! Cholesterol is a precursor to testosterone.

2\. Moderate protein - High amounts of protein can cause insulin to spike, which can disrupt a healthy hormone balance. 6-8 oz of meat per meal should be plenty.

3\. Lower your carbs - Carbohydrates boost your insulin levels, which can lower your T level. A low-carb diet such as keto is ideal for boosting your testosterone naturally. Add intermittent fasting for an extra boost.

4\. Exercise - High-intensity interval training (HIIT) will help stimulate testosterone.

5\. Sleep - Getting enough sleep is vital to normal and healthy hormone levels. Poor quality and duration of sleep can cause an increase in cortisol, which can throw off your testosterone level. Long walks are great for getting better sleep and lowering cortisol.

6\. Lower your estrogen - Testosterone and estrogen oppose each other. If you have high estrogen, you will have lower testosterone. Avoid soy and non-organic products.

7\. Supplements - Zinc, Korean red ginseng, L-arginine, and D-aspartic acid are great supplements for supporting healthy testosterone levels.

The last couple of things I want to mention is that a fatty liver, high iron levels, and statin drugs may also cause low testosterone levels. Make sure you talk with your doctor about these potential problems.

## What are the most effective natural remedies for managing silent acid reflux, and how do these approaches help alleviate its symptoms while promoting long-term digestive health?

Apple Cider Vinegar and Betaine Hydrochloride:

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) can increase stomach acid production and aid digestion. Mix a tablespoon of ACV with water and consume before meals. Betaine hydrochloride (HCl) supplements, taken with meals, may also improve symptoms if low stomach acid is a concern.

Salt and Potassium:

Adequate levels of salt and potassium are crucial for digestive health. Himalayan pink salt or Celtic sea salt, rich in trace minerals, and potassium-rich foods like bananas and avocados can support proper stomach acid regulation.

Vitamin D:

Vitamin D is essential for controlling inflammation and supporting stomach acid production. Deficiency is common in individuals with digestive issues. Increase intake through vitamin D-rich foods and sunlight exposure, or consult your doctor for supplementation.

Integrating Natural Remedies:

Combine these remedies with conventional treatments like Tums, while considering their potential side effects. Lifestyle and dietary adjustments can enhance overall management of silent acid reflux. Consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice.

Viruses can come out of remission when you’re stressed and can lodge into the vocal cords, causing them to shut down. You can’t kill a virus because it’s not alive. A virus goes in and out of remission, depending on the state of your health or stress level. There’s always an earlier stress event that causes a weakened immune system and leads to problems with the vocal cords.

We’re going to remove the stuck stress that lodges in the throat. If you ever have laryngitis or a sore throat, this “singer’s cure” should give you some relief in only about 2 minutes. Watch the video for an in-depth demonstration of this unique acupressure technique. You can have someone do this technique on you, or you can use my Self Massage Tool for this sore throat remedy. This laryngitis remedy does not cure the virus. It helps to remove the blockage by working on the opposite side of the blockage.

## What are the most effective remedies and strategies for alleviating and managing bloating?

The #1 remedy for bloating: activated charcoal. Using activated charcoal also happens to be one of the best ways to detox.

**Activated charcoal can help with a range of issues, including:**

• Bloating

• Gas

• Belching

• Nausea

• Diarrhea

• Headaches

• Food poisoning

• Stomach acidity

• Detox reaction

• Bad breath

Activated charcoal is different from the charcoal used in a grill. You can find activated charcoal in a health food store, and it’s been used as a natural remedy for a long time. Activated charcoal binds to things like toxins and helps remove them. It’s important to remember that this remedy for digestive issues like bloating is only helping you with a symptom. It’s helping you in a natural way, which is fantastic, but it’s not getting to the root cause.

There is usually an underlying cause leading to symptoms like bloating. But, while you work to identify the root cause, activated charcoal may be a beneficial natural remedy to use.

## What are the most effective remedies and treatment approaches for managing ADD/ADHD, and how do these methods address both the symptoms and underlying causes of the condition?

**Niacinamide and Its Potential for Managing ADD/ADHD**

Research by Dr. William Kaufman, M.D., indicates that high doses of niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3) may effectively address symptoms of ADD and ADHD. Niacinamide is crucial for the production of NAD, which facilitates cellular energy conversion from food into ATP. By enhancing energy in nerve cells, niacinamide can help reduce hyperactivity and improve focus.

Due to its water-soluble nature, niacinamide is quickly metabolized, necessitating frequent dosing—around 250 mg six to eight times daily. This approach can be beneficial for both adults and children with ADD or ADHD. However, it is essential to complement supplementation with a balanced diet and consult a healthcare provider before making any changes to medication or treatment plans.

## What are the most effective remedies for addressing dry and wrinkled skin?

Say goodbye to dry, dehydrated skin! While most moisturizers contain alcohol, which can worsen dryness, there are natural solutions that truly nourish your skin.

Vitamin E, coconut oil, and tallow offer relief, but the champion of hydration is hyaluronic acid. This powerful molecule, naturally found in your body, holds an incredible 1000 times its weight in water, making it essential for youthful, supple skin. It even aids in wound repair and sunburn recovery.

Unfortunately, hyaluronic acid levels decline with age or due to certain conditions. But don't worry! You can replenish it through injections, topical application, or oral supplements. Just 200mg daily can make a noticeable difference in combating dryness and wrinkles.

For quick relief, apply a few drops of alcohol-free hyaluronic acid to damp skin, rubbing it gently into your hands and face. Remember, healthy skin starts from within. A balanced diet like the Healthy Keto® approach can further enhance your skin's radiance.

Say hello to hydrated, glowing skin with hyaluronic acid!

## What are the most effective remedies for addressing dry and wrinkly skin, and how can these treatments improve skin hydration and elasticity?

Anything you put on the skin gets directly absorbed into your body.

**Because your skin is mainly composed of protein and fat, a low-fat diet is one of the worst things for your skin. Seed oils, synthetic starches, and synthetic sugars also have detrimental effects on your skin health.**

Seed oils like corn oil, cottonseed oil, canola oil, soy oil, safflower oil, and sunflower oil are very high in omega-6 fatty acids. These highly processed oils are deodorized and decolorized and are made using solvents like hexane. They can get lodged into your membranes and can stay there for two and a half to three years.

When you consume too many omega-6 fatty acids (seed oils) and not enough omega-3 fatty acids, you develop dry, red, flaky skin. Your skin may also start to look older.

**Grass-fed beef tallow is very similar to your skin’s natural sebum and will not oxidize the skin or cause inflammation. Tallow contains vitamins A, D, E, and K and the compound CLA, which helps the skin retain moisture.**

**Tallow softens the skin and leaves it with a healthy glow.** The nutrients in tallow can also help eliminate dark spots and wrinkles. Tallow is fifty percent saturated fat and contains oleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, and linoleic acid—all of which have positive benefits for your skin. For better skin, remove seed oils from the diet, apply tallow to the skin, and consume more omega-3 fatty acids. You should notice improvement in your skin in a matter of weeks.

## What are the most effective remedies for managing a range of lung conditions?

**Lung Health Support: Vitamin D, Light Therapy, and the Power of the Sun**

If you struggle with lung infections, asthma, or COPD, consider these natural approaches alongside your doctor-recommended treatment:

**Why these conditions overlap:** Inflammation, constricted airways, and immune system challenges are common threads. Over time, standard medications can lose effectiveness.

**Vitamin D: A Potential Helper**

* Benefits: Fights microbes, modulates immunity, reduces inflammation, and supports lung muscle function.
* Note: Some people have genetic variations affecting vitamin D absorption ("polymorphism"). If standard doses don't seem to help, talk to your doctor about testing and potentially increasing your intake.

**Light Therapy: Promising Research**

* Infrared Light: May relax airways for easier breathing, combat inflammation, potentially reduce scarring in COPD, and even help filter air pollutants.
* UV Light: Can kill airborne germs, reducing the burden on your immune system.

**The Ultimate Lung Remedy: The Sun**

Sunlight delivers a powerhouse combo: UV light, UVB light (for vitamin D production), and infrared light. This natural exposure directly benefits your lungs, inflammation levels, and immune function. Plus, sunlight boosts melatonin, a potent antioxidant that may even reduce coughing.

**\*Please keep in mind that the above is not a medical advice. You should see your doctor about any possible medical conditions.**

## What are the most effective remedies for managing and reducing teeth grinding?

**Grinding your teeth can lead to issues like:**

• Excessive wearing of the teeth

• Teeth pain

• Headaches

• Jaw spasms

People who smoke, drink alcohol, or take SSRIs have a higher risk of teeth grinding (bruxism). There are a few things involved in teeth grinding at night, but it seems to be largely related to the autonomic nervous system.

Bruxism is also associated with a certain variation in genetics. The gene involved is the receptor gene for serotonin. If you have this variation, you’ll have to work harder to increase the precursors of serotonin to help build it up.

**Bruxism can also be triggered by various things, including:**

• Stress events

• Trauma

• Excess caffeine consumption

**The best natural remedies for teeth grinding:**

1\. Vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast)

2\. Vitamin D3

## What are the most effective remedies or treatment approaches for managing cataracts, and how do these methods work to slow their progression or improve vision?

Typical treatments for cataracts have side effects, so today we’re going to talk about natural alternatives for cataracts.

The eyes are highly affected by your blood sugar levels. When your blood sugar is high, it creates a lot of oxidative stress in different tissues, including the eyes.

Our bodies produce antioxidants to protect against this oxidation and free radical damage. But certain things, like age and diet, can cause our bodies to make fewer antioxidants. However, plants also make potent antioxidants that we can take advantage of to help counter the effects of oxidative stress. The two categories that we’re focusing on today are carotenoids and anthocyanins.

**Foods high in carotenoids:**

• Yellow, orange, red, and purple vegetables

• Pasture-raised egg yolks

• Grass-fed meats

**Foods high in anthocyanins:**

• Bilberries

• Blueberries

• Blackberries

• Chokeberries

• Black currant

• Red cabbage

**Here is the best natural remedy to potentially help with cataracts.**

**Ingredients:**

• 1 cup berries

• 1 cup kefir (grass-fed, whole milk, unsweetened)

## What are the most effective strategies and practices for improving sleep quality at night, and how can they be tailored to address individual sleep challenges?

### **Sleep Better with Vitamin D and Smart Habits**

**Struggling to sleep soundly?** You're not alone. Many experience sleep problems like trouble falling asleep, nighttime urination, or restless legs.

**Here's how Vitamin D can be your sleep ally:**

* **Improved Sleep Quality:** Vitamin D may enhance sleep duration and quality.
* **Gut & Immune Boost:** It also supports gut health and immune function, both crucial for overall well-being.

**Unlocking Magnesium's Power:** Magnesium helps with cramping, restless legs, high cortisol, and heart palpitations. If magnesium alone isn't working, consider adding Vitamin D - they work together for better results. Vitamin D is a potent anti-inflammatory, adding to its benefits.

**Prioritizing Sleep for Optimal Health:** Sleep reigns supreme when it comes to health. The part of your brain that controls sleep (hypothalamus) has plenty of vitamin D receptors. If you're obese, diabetic, or aging, your need for vitamin D increases significantly.

**Understanding Vitamin D Levels:** A level below 40 ng/mL can negatively impact your health. For optimal benefits, aim for 70-100 ng/mL or higher.

**Blood Test Limitations:** Standard blood tests measure inactive Vitamin D, not what reaches your cells.

**Tips for Better Sleep with Vitamin D:**

* **Supplement Wisely:** Consider taking at least 30,000 IUs of Vitamin D3 for sleep improvement. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.
* **Reduce Calcium Intake:** Limit dairy to manage calcium intake, as it can interfere with Vitamin D absorption.
* **Cofactors for Enhanced Absorption:** Take Vitamin K2, magnesium, zinc, and Vitamin B6 alongside Vitamin D - these nutrients help your body absorb Vitamin D effectively.

**Bonus Sleep Hygiene Tips:**

* **Nighttime Routine:** Take your Vitamin D with cofactors with your last meal.
* **Cool and Dark Environment:** Ensure your bedroom is cool and dark for optimal sleep.
* **Power Down Before Bed:** Avoid electronics and bright lights for at least 2 hours before bedtime.

By incorporating Vitamin D and these simple sleep hygiene practices, you can unlock a world of better sleep and improved overall health.

## What are the most effective strategies and practices for supporting and enhancing the health of your microbiome and overall gut health?

One of the benefits of fiber is that it feeds your microbiome. Your microbiome has many different functions, including fermentation. During the fermentation process, the microbes make small-chain fatty acids, vitamins, other acids, and secondary compounds that support the immune system.

But, if your microbes don't have access to fiber, they can consume other things. If someone is on a carnivore diet, their microbes can adapt to digest protein. You're not going to kill your microbes if you avoid plants. The important thing is to avoid grains. While some people have difficulty consuming any vegetables, other people may be able to consume fermented vegetables. This includes foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, and pickled vegetables.

Fermented vegetables have additional microbes that may help support your gut. They also have prebiotics, vitamins, and other health benefits.

**Tips to support your microbiome and overall gut health:**

1\. If you consume animal products, consume grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

2\. If you are vegan or vegetarian, don't consume grains.

3\. If you have severe gut problems, try a carnivore diet with grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

4\. If you have less severe problems with digestion, try consuming fermented vegetables along with grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

5\. If you don't have any digestive problems, try consuming a combination of plants (not grains) and grass-fed, grass-finished animal products.

## What are the most effective strategies for managing and reducing alcohol cravings?

Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body. Glutamine turns into glutamate, which is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain. L-glutamine increases gluconeogenesis, which is the production of new sugar. This means that this amino acid can quickly turn to sugar and feed your brain cells, but it won’t spike your insulin.

Both sugar and alcohol can provide a sense of relief to some people. L-glutamine may help provide fuel to the brain and reduce stress, anxiety, and pressure—this may help reduce the need for alcohol and sugar. L-glutamine has many other potential health benefits, as well. Alcohol consumption can block glutamine and all of the beneficial effects that come with it.

**Foods rich in glutamine:**

• Beef

• Chicken

• Fish

• Eggs

• Dairy

• Cabbage

• Dark leafy green vegetables

**Other things that may help get rid of cravings for alcohol and sugar:**

• Regular exercise without overtraining

• Getting enough sleep

• Reducing stress

• Consuming less alcohol

• Get on the keto diet and do intermittent fasting

***

## What are the most effective strategies for reducing stress to its lowest possible level?

Anxiety is defined as worrying about something that may or may not happen. It can be triggered by speculation, sensationalism, or conjecture. Speculation is when we are concerned about things not based on facts or knowledge, while sensationalism is the use of shocking words or exaggerated stories to grab attention. A conjecture, on the other hand, is an opinion based on guessing rather than the truth.

These triggers can cause anxiety that, if left unchecked, may become chronic and affect our adrenal glands. This, in turn, encourages the release of adrenaline and cortisol, weakening our immune system and accelerating the aging process.

**Limiting exposure to stress through activities such as exercise and spending time in nature is essential to break this cycle. It’s also best to avoid negative messages and sensationalized news that provoke these anxious thoughts.**

**Additionally, incorporating adaptogens into our diet, such as vitamin B1 and ashwagandha, helps to strengthen our ability to cope with daily stress.**

***

## What are the most effective strategies for restoring and maintaining natural sleep patterns?

To restore natural sleep, maintain consistent wake-up times and bedtime routines, avoid stimulants like caffeine and alcohol, create a comfortable sleep environment, limit screen time before bed, engage in relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation, and exercise regularly.

***

## What are the most effective strategies for restoring menstruation after chemotherapy, and how can one support hormonal balance and reproductive health during recovery?

Restoring your menstrual cycle after chemotherapy involves supporting your body's recovery and detoxification. A healthy ketogenic diet combined with intermittent fasting can aid in healing. Additionally, focus on consuming nutrient-dense foods, particularly cruciferous vegetables, to support liver function and overall detoxification. Patience is key, as it may take time for your body to fully recover.

## What are the most effective strategies for significantly boosting and sustaining energy levels?

**Coffee doesn't give you energy. I**t gets rid of the fatigue molecule so that you don’t feel tired. Glucose and sugar might seem to give you an energy boost, but they actually make you tired!

**Here are 7 ways to raise your energy levels naturally without a crash.**

**1. Magnesium**

Magnesium is a cofactor to make ATP, which is like the battery source for the body. The #1 symptom of low magnesium is fatigue. Magnesium-rich foods include spinach, almonds, avocado, and fish.

**2. Sodium-potassium pump**

The sodium-potassium pump in your cells allows you to generate an electrical charge that powers your muscles and your nervous system. Adequate sodium and potassium intake is crucial for healthy energy levels. Electrolyte powder can help if you’re not consuming enough sodium and potassium from your diet.

**3. Mitochondrial biogenesis**

Creating more mitochondria through consistent exercise can boost energy levels. Fasting, intermittent fasting, cold therapy, and polyphenols can also increase mitochondria. Polyphenols are found in certain vegetables, herbs, berries, and dark chocolate.

**4. Ketones**

If you follow a keto diet, you can get your body running on ketones. Ketones produce more energy than glucose.

**5. Carnitine**

Carnitine is a compound that can help transport fat into the mitochondria. Carnitine helps increase exercise endurance, delays the fatigue factor, and acts as an antioxidant to decrease damage in the muscles. Red meat is the best source of carnitine.

**6. Apple cider vinegar**

Apple cider vinegar can be used by the mitochondria as fuel. Add one tablespoon to a glass of water each day.

**7. B vitamins**

B vitamins are intimately involved with every part of your mitochondria that generates ATP from your food. Nutritional yeast is one of the best sources of B vitamins.

## What are the most effective strategies for supporting pancreatic health, and how can these methods help prevent pancreatic disorders and maintain overall metabolic well-being?

Dr. Berg recommends several strategies to support a healthy pancreas:

1. **Dietary Adjustments**:
   * **The Healthy® Keto Diet**: This diet encourages a low-carbohydrate lifestyle to manage and potentially reverse insulin resistance, which is crucial for pancreatic health.
   * **Intermittent Fasting**: Incorporating fasting into your routine can improve insulin sensitivity and support pancreatic health.
   * **Avoid Refined Carbohydrates and Sugars**: These are known triggers for insulin resistance, particularly in individuals with a pancreas body type.
2. **Natural Supplements**:
   * **Berberine**: This supplement helps regulate blood sugar levels and supports the cells in your pancreas responsible for insulin production.
   * **Beef Pancreas Extract**: Provides direct support to the pancreas.
   * **Milk Thistle**: Known for improving insulin sensitivity and supporting liver health, which is indirectly beneficial for pancreatic function.
3. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
   * **Regular Exercise**: Including interval training can help maintain healthy growth hormone levels, which are essential for overall endocrine health.
   * **Adequate Sleep**: Ensuring good quality sleep to support overall hormonal balance and reduce stress on the pancreas.

These strategies aim to enhance pancreatic function and overall metabolic health, thereby supporting better blood sugar management and reducing the burden on the pancreas.

## What are the most effective strategies or therapeutic interventions for managing and alleviating the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)?

One theory is that too much testosterone can cause an enlarged prostate. This is false. In fact, your risk of an enlarged prostate increases with age, and you also have less testosterone (DHT) as you age. High estrogen is the real cause of an enlarged prostate.

Testosterone and estrogen oppose each other. So when you have high estrogen, your testosterone levels lower.

The most common reasons for high estrogen are consuming foods high in estrogen, adrenal fatigue, and having too much body fat.

**The best ways to reduce estrogen are:**

• Get on healthy keto to reduce your body fat

• Consume cruciferous vegetables

• Avoid estrogenic foods (GMOs, foods with added hormones, soy, etc.)

• Sea kelp

• Stinging nettle root (to reduce aromatase, which converts testosterone into estrogen)

## What are the most effective strategies or treatments for managing and alleviating the symptoms of endometriosis?

Endometriosis is a very uncomfortable and often painful issue caused by estrogen dominance. To help relieve symptoms of endometriosis, you will want to get your estrogen balanced.

Dr. Berg's video on the subject can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yINSNtpCX2Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yINSNtpCX2Q).

As the video outlines, consuming organic foods is a great place to start. This will help you avoid estrogenic hormones and chemicals that can increase estrogen production.

Cruciferous vegetables can help balance estrogen as well. You can also consume a concentrated form of crucifers called DIM. Another nutrient you will want to add to your diet is iodine.

Dr. Berg has DIM Supplement Estrogen Balance which was specifically formulated to help with issues related to estrogen dominance. You can review the product page here - [https://shop.drberg.com/product/estrogen-balance-with-dim](https://shop.drberg.com/product/estrogen-balance-with-dim).

## What are the most effective supplements for managing lymphoedema, and how do they contribute to reducing symptoms and improving lymphatic health?

Lymphedema presents a significant challenge, particularly when associated with hypothyroidism. Unlike simple fluid retention, lymphedema involves the accumulation of a specific waste product, which results from impaired lymphatic function.

Several strategies are commonly employed to manage this condition:

1\. **Rebounding**: Using a rebounder, or mini-trampoline, can effectively stimulate the lymphatic system and promote lymphatic drainage, helping to alleviate symptoms.

2\. **Thyroid Support**: Supporting thyroid function is crucial in managing lymphedema associated with hypothyroidism. Key interventions include:

\- **Sea Kelp**: Rich in iodine, sea kelp can help support thyroid health.

\- **Selenium**: This essential mineral is vital for the conversion of T4 to T3, the active form of thyroid hormone.

Despite these strategies, lymphedema remains a particularly difficult condition to manage due to its complex and somewhat mysterious nature. While certain interventions can provide relief and support, there is currently no definitive solution for resolving lymphedema entirely. Continued research and individualized treatment approaches are essential for improving outcomes for those affected by this challenging condition.

## What are the most effective treatment options and management strategies for addressing Dupuytren’s contracture?

Dupuytren’s contracture a condition in which one or more fingers becomes permanently bent in a flexed position. So there's a couple of different theories of it. They don't really know exactly why it is, but I will say that I would take because we have a contracture, I would take magnesium first.

You can take different versions like glycosinate is a, is a good type of magnesium and I wouldn't also avoid calcium. I would probably take a calcium. Usually you can get magnesium with calcium in there and that way you have the minerals to allow the contraction and relaxation of muscles. Now the other point about this contraction is that if your pH is too on the alkaline side, that can create these minerals from working correctly. So you may find that if you acidify the body with either ongoing apple cider vinegar and or a tainted hydrochloride, you can take it when you eat for your digestive system. You may find that that allows us minerals to work a lot better as well.

it's either a pH problem, I'm guessing, or a mineral problem between magnesium and calcium.

Using a foam roller to support your lower back while sitting can significantly alleviate sciatica and lower back pain.

***

## What are the most effective treatments and remedies for alleviating migraine symptoms?

**Understanding Hyponatremia and Migraines**

Hyponatremia is a condition in which the blood has too little sodium. This is important because sodium and potassium work together to create electrical charges that power muscles and nerves. People with migraines often have a mutation that leaves potassium channels in their brain cells stuck open, causing nerve excitation and potential electrical imbalances.

**The Salt Connection**

Some studies suggest that increasing your sodium intake may lessen migraine headaches. This could be because the extra sodium helps restore the balance between sodium and potassium in the brain. If you're prone to migraines, try consuming more salt right before a headache starts (around 4600mg, but start with the standard 2300mg and monitor your reaction).

**Causes of Sodium Deficiency**

Low sodium levels aren't always caused by a lack of salt in your diet. Other potential causes include:

* Addison's disease
* High-carb diets
* Diarrhea or vomiting
* Diuretic medications
* Excessive water consumption
* Blood loss (heavy periods)
* Excessive sweating
* Major burns

**Important Note:** It's always best to consult a doctor for personal advice, especially if you suspect a sodium deficiency or have any underlying health conditions.

## What are the most effective treatments to reduce an enlarged prostate naturally?

**Symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia:**

• Frequent urination (especially at night)

• A weak stream

• Dribbling after urination

• A sensation that you can’t fully empty your bladder

Excess estrogen increases the size of the prostate. Estrogen also increases prolactin, which can increase the size of the prostate. Estrogen is a byproduct of testosterone in both females and males. To convert testosterone to estrogen, you need an enzyme called aromatase. The testicles and fat cells make aromatase.

Phytoestrogens can mimic estrogen, but not very much. To shrink the prostate naturally, we want to inhibit aromatase to decrease estrogen production.

**Top things that increase aromatase:**

• Age

• Body fat

• Insulin

• High-carb diets

• Alcohol

• Whole grains

• Hormone replacement therapy

• Birth control pills

**Things that decrease aromatase:**

• Cruciferous vegetables

• White button mushrooms (sautéed)

• Flaxseed

• Green tea

• Citrus peel

In addition to losing weight with Healthy Keto®, reducing insulin, and consuming cruciferous vegetables, you can try a fantastic natural remedy for an enlarged prostate that involves citrus peel.

## What are the most effective ways to lose belly fat?

Diets don’t work for belly fat. Why? Because it’s not a weight problem, it’s actually a hormone problem. It’s a cortisol problem. Diets don’t lower cortisol, they lower calories. You also do not want to overtrain.

Exercise is a type of stress that can aggravate the belly. Instead of intense exercise, try going on long walks.

Cortisol is a hormone from the adrenals. It’s triggered by all kinds of stress.

**How to lose belly fat fast:**

• Minimize stress

• Sleep (Take Adrenal & Cortisol Support, try acupressure)

## What are the most effective ways to support and enhance fertility through lifestyle, diet, and other strategies?

Supporting fertility involves several key strategies, especially as you prepare your body for pregnancy. Prioritize a nutrient-rich diet, focusing on vitamin E in the form of tocotrienols, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and essential trace minerals. Royal jelly, known for its fertility-enhancing properties, can also be beneficial. Additionally, be mindful of environmental factors, such as exposure to GMO foods, which may negatively impact fertility. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and minimizing these risks are crucial steps in fostering optimal reproductive health.

## What are the most important benefits of adaptogens?

An adaptogen is usually a plant or herb that helps increase the ability to adapt and avoid damage from harmful factors. The Latin word for adaptogen is "adaptare," which means to adjust or fit. The greek word for "GEN" means produced by or generated by. So, an adaptogen generates the ability to adjust to stress.

Stress is something that threatens homeostasis.

Homeostasis is a steady state of equilibrium. You have different normal values that are generated by different mechanisms that control homeostasis, which is your internal ability to adapt to the environment—to keep things normal. But, when you have stress, it can push some of these factors out of balance. For example, when you're stressed, cortisol goes up. In this situation, an adaptogen can help bring that back to normal. If your immune system is suppressed, adaptogens may even be able to help bring it back to a higher level.

**The four best adaptogens:**

1\. Siberian ginseng

2\. Panax ginseng

3\. Rhodiola

4\. Ashwagandha

**Ashwagandha can be good for:**

• Inflammatory conditions like arthritis

• Anxiety

• ADHA

• Stress relief

• Lowering cortisol

• Adrenal stress

## What are the most important benefits of baking soda?

Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is widely used in baking. Many people get relief from things like acid reflux when they take baking soda, but it comes with a package. The stomach helps you digest proteins, absorb minerals, and kill pathogens. It’s designed to produce and make acid. The stomach should normally be extremely acidic.

A person can experience acid reflux if they lose their stomach acids. Many people think that a person with acid reflux has too much acid, but they actually don’t have strong enough acid.

Baking soda is very alkaline. So, when you take baking soda, you’re going to feel better temporarily, but you’re not fixing the root problem. If you do this, the issue could actually get worse over time because you’re taking the acid out of the stomach and you’re not adding it back in.

**Side effects of taking baking soda long-term**

* It alkalizes the stomach
* Creates problems with protein absorption
* Creates problems with mineral absorption
* Decreases the ability of the stomach to kill pathogens
* Depletes your potassium reserve
* Decreases chlorides
* Baking soda has high levels of sodium

## What are the most important benefits of calcium?

Most people associate calcium with bone health. However, it has numerous other functions that are essential for a healthy body. The number one function of calcium is intercellular communication. What this means is that it helps with the communication between cells. When you don't have enough calcium outside your cells and too much calcium inside your cells, this is a problem called intercellular hypercalcinosis. This is caused by not enough calcium.

**When this happens, you can develop problems, including:**

• Hypertension

• Hardening arteries

• Diabetes

• Cancer

• Inflammation

• Soft tissue calcium

Calcium also controls natural cell death - called apoptosis. A problem with this can trigger tumors. The main reasons for low calcium could be a deficiency in Vitamin D3, Vitamin K2, Omega3, and Magnesium. These help transport, absorb, or regulate calcium.

Avoid calcium carbonate. This form of calcium is not beneficial for increasing calcium levels.

## What are the most important benefits of chlorophyll?

**Chlorophyll is like the blood of the plant. It’s the green plant pigment. There are some interesting potential healing properties in chlorophyll. The chemistry of chlorophyll is actually very similar to our blood, but chlorophyll has magnesium, and our blood has iron.**

When you have gut issues, consuming certain greens can irritate the colon. There are different chemicals in vegetables, like lectin, that can irritate the gut lining. The fiber in vegetables can also be an issue for certain gut problems.

But, juicing greens that are low in lectins and oxalates or a green juice powder (wheatgrass juice powder) without the fiber could give you the chlorophyll you need without the potential problems. Chlorophyll can be a great therapy for the gut as long as the lectins are on the low side and there’s no fiber.

**Benefits of chlorophyll for gut issues:**

1\. It may help improve or restore dysfunction in the tight junctions

2\. It can support enterocytes (intestinal cells)

3\. It may help slow down the formation of fibrous tissue (fibrosis) and cirrhosis in the liver

4\. It can act as a powerful anti-inflammatory

## What are the most important benefits of coconut oil?

It’s been used for hundreds of years by many cultures without problems. In fact, there are some cultures whose diet is 60 percent coconut-based, which is quite healthy. (Side note: coconut oil will boost HDL, the so-called good cholesterol.)

The coconut is the largest seed on earth. It takes 3 years to break down the soil it's in, so that it can grow.

**The three significant benefits of coconut oil are:**

● Supports your brain. A significant amount of coconut oil is what’s called MCT, or medium-chain triglycerides. This is a type of fat that turns into ketones. Your brain cells love ketones. They protect the nerves and brain cells against stress. They’ve been shown to boost cognitive function, and help people with dementia as well as Alzheimer’s.

● It’s antibacterial and antimicrobial. Its 3 main fatty acids are caprylic, capril, and lauric, and they’re responsible for these properties, along with being antifungal, anti-candida, anti-yeast, and antiviral. Monolaurin, the precursor to lauric acid, has the capacity to dismantle the fatty layer around certain viruses. So it’s beneficial for your immune system.

● Provides you more energy, because MCT oil doesn’t require digestive enzymes. It gets absorbed directly into your body. You get fatty acids and ketones for fuel, which are much more efficient than glucose. You’ll get more of what’s called ATP, the body’s energy than you do from carbs.

## What are the most important benefits of dark chocolate?

Cacao is the raw bean that’s fermented and processed into chocolate. Cacao and dark chocolate are both loaded with phytonutrients (polyphenols and flavonols). They actually have higher amounts than blueberries or açaí berries. There is a small amount of caffeine in cacao and dark chocolate, as well as a good amount of theobromine (a stimulant). So, if you have cacao or dark chocolate later in the day or before bed, it may keep you up.

I consume a little bit of chocolate on a regular basis, but I always consume chocolate that is organic and doesn’t contain sugar. A few brands I like are Lily’s Sweets and Choc Zero. Cacao and dark chocolate are high in oxalates. So, if you’re at risk for kidney stones, you may not want to consume either one.

## What are the most important benefits of eggs?

Eggs are the content of the hard-shelled reproductive body produced by a bird, considered as food. Eggs and the nutrition in them are necessary in your diet, especially if you are choosing to change your health for the better and lose weight. Many people consider that they are the best source of protein.

**Benefits**

* Have the highest anabolic effect
* Are very high in nutrients
* Are loaded with healthy fats
* Contain lutein and zeaxanthin, very powerful phytonutrients (healthy substances found in plants), and antioxidants to repair any potential damage that occurs in the artery walls of the eyes
* Help prevent gallstones

**Nutrients in egg yolks**

* Choline
* Selenium
* Biotin
* Vitamins A, B12, D, E and K2
* Phosphorus
* Omega-3 fatty acids
* Calcium
* Immunoglobulins

**Nutrients in egg whites**

* Most of the egg protein
* Avidin
* Vitamins B2 & B3
* Magnesium
* Potassium

**Eggs and cholesterol**

Are eggs bad for your cholesterol? If you’re afraid of eggs increasing your cholesterol, keep in mind that there’s no evidence to support the idea that eggs raise your bad cholesterol. They can raise your good cholesterol, which isn’t bad for your heart.

Also keep in mind that when you consume cholesterol, your body simply makes less of it (it works the opposite way too). In fact, only around 25% of your cholesterol comes from your diet— your body makes the other 75%. And you need cholesterol for your brain, cells, membranes and hormone production.

**How to consume them**

It is best to consume both egg yolk and egg white.

The best way to preserve the vital nutrients in your eggs is to cook them in ways that leave a runny yolk. The less you heat the yolk, the more nutrients it contains. Try not to overcook hard- boiled eggs. If you scramble your eggs, try not to cook them too much. The problem with raw eggs is that the uncooked egg whites can deplete other nutrients like biotin. So always cook the whites, but leave the yolks runny.

**Where to get them**

Always go with farm-raised and organic eggs. When you crack open an egg and see that it has a dark orange egg yolk, it’s a sign that it’s an egg from a pasture-raised chicken. Organic, pasture-raised chickens eat natural grass and insects. This means you won’t be consuming GMOs. There are no bad effects when you consume organic pasture-raised eggs, so don’t be afraid to use them on a regular basis.

Factory-farmed eggs are a pale yellow color. These chickens consume GMO grains, which are not recommended. Sometimes pasture-raised organic eggs can have a yellow egg yolk, but they won’t be pale. Pasture-raised organic eggs have more carotenoids, which are plant-based antioxidants that have a wide range of benefits. If you are developing vision problems as you age, you are especially going to want to consume pasture-raised eggs. Carotenoids can help you avoid macular degeneration.

Keep in mind that when you see the term “cage-free” this doesn’t mean these are necessarily better eggs. The chickens could be kept in a large barn with no sunlight. And these eggs are often not non-GMO.

## What are the most important benefits of erythritol?

Erythritol is a sugar alcohol but it doesn’t have alcohol in it. It is an alternative sweetener. It has a cooling factor and zero glycemic index: it does not increase the blood sugars.

In your body erythritol is absorbed in the small intestine, it gets into the blood, but it is excreted by the kidney unchanged. The microbes don’t like to eat it. There aren’t many side effects of erythritol. It has zero impact on insulin because it doesn’t affect the blood sugars.

**Benefits**

* Good sugar substitute on keto
* Has a cooling factor
* Zero glycemic index

**Dangers of erythritol in high doses (greater than 50 grams)**

* Gas
* Bloating
* Stomach noise
* Laxative effect

**How to consume it**

Use it as a keto-friendly sugar alternative.

**Where to get it**

You can get it at a grocery store or order it online.

## What are the most important benefits of vitamin B5 for adrenal glands?

Vitamin B5 is essential for the adrenals, as it helps with synthesizing acetylcholine, cortisol, epinephrine, serotonin, and melatonin. It plays a key role in producing stress hormones and regulating sleep and mood. Vitamin B5 supports cells controlling the circadian rhythm and helps balance cortisol levels, which is crucial for good sleep.

Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) can be taken as a supplement, but pantethine, an active form, may be more effective. For adrenal or sleep issues, taking 500 to 1,000 mg of vitamin B5 can help lower cortisol and improve sleep.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/vitamin-b5-adrenals-your-sleep)

***

## What are the most important benefits of Vitamin B5?

**Vitamin B5 is essential for the synthesis of:**

• Acetylcholine (good for focus and memory)

• Cortisol

• Epinephrine

• Serotonin

• Melatonin

Vitamin B5 is very important for creating stress hormones, as well as the hormones involved in sleep and your mood. Vitamin B5 can also directly support the cell that controls the circadian rhythm.

Vitamin B5 is needed to make cortisol. Vitamin B5 also helps regulate cortisol, so it’s not too high or too low. You’re not going to be able to sleep if you have high cortisol.

You can take pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) as a supplement. But, there is another version of pantothenic acid called pantethine that may be more powerful. Pantethine is like the active form of pantothenic acid. If you have adrenal problems or sleep problems, you may want to take between 500 and 1,000mg of vitamin B5 to help lower cortisol and promote better sleep.

## What are the most important benefits of zinc for the kids?

It’s very important that children have enough zinc in their diet and that they don’t consume things that could deplete them of zinc. Zinc is important for kids mostly because the neurons in the forebrain are dependent on zinc. This is the part of the brain involved in cognitive processes, including thinking, memory, and speech.

There are two studies that show a link between a zinc deficiency and neuropsychological problems, especially reasoning.

**A zinc deficiency could potentially:**

• Inhibit a person’s ability to learn

• Reduce the ability to have attention

• Cause poor retention of data (poor memory)

**It’s also important for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers to take zinc.**

**The number one thing that depletes zinc is phytic acid. Phytic acid is in things like:**

• Cereal

• Corn

• Soy

• Wheat

## What are the most important foods for shinier and healthier hair?

1\. Bamboo shoots are high in trace minerals, potassium, and silica—essential for building hair protein. Silica makes hair strong and elastic and also prevents breakage and brittleness. Silica supports skin, joint, and bone health as well!

2\. Wild-caught salmon is an excellent source of protein and is loaded with nutrition. It’s also one of the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Wild-caught salmon is a potent source of vitamin D3, which can improve nearly every problem with hair loss. Vitamin D controls the hair follicle and can activate dormant hair follicle stem cells.

3\. Egg yolks are loaded with biotin, vital for keratin production. They also contain all of the fat-soluble nutrients that are essential for hair growth and hair health. Egg yolks are a rich source of cholesterol, a precursor for the hormones necessary for hair growth. Cholesterol increases hair shine and luster and strengthens the hair shaft. Egg yolks contain vitamin D and sulfur, which supports a healthy scalp.

4\. Grass-fed liver contains concentrated amounts of almost every nutrient. It’s high in iron, vital for oxygen transport to the scalp. One of the most common causes of hair shedding is iron deficiency. An iron deficiency can be caused by low iron or a copper deficiency.

***

## What are the most important foods to eat to prevent and manage hair loss, and how do they support hair health?

**A study has shown that over 90 percent of people suffering from alopecia are deficient in an amino acid called histidine.** This essential amino acid is a precursor to histamine, which plays a vital role in immune reactions, allergies, and inflammation.

**Deficiencies in histidine can lead to anemia, while excessive intake can cause premature ejaculation. However, the right amount of histidine in your diet can promote healthy hair growth by helping to produce keratin and regulating copper and zinc levels.**

Certain medications and alcohol consumption may lower histidine levels in the body, while inadequate stomach acid can hinder its absorption from food sources. To counter this issue, betaine hydrochloride can be taken as an acidifier.

But to fully utilize histidine, specific co-factors must be present, such as vitamin B6, proper copper and zinc ratios, and folate.

**The top three foods that can help combat hair loss are:**

1\. Organ meats, including liver, due to the histidine and other essential nutrients they contain.

2\. Animal proteins, such as beef and chicken, are rich in histidine and other amino acids necessary for hair regeneration.

3\. Shellfish, particularly shrimp, scallops, and crabs, provide high levels of zinc and copper that can help maintain proper ratios in the body.

It's important to note that having enough folate in your diet is essential for hair development. It's best to obtain folate from natural sources, as taking supplements such as folic acid may inhibit the conversion of histidine into its active form.

## What are the most nutritious and effective sources of calcium for individuals following a dairy-free diet?

Calcium is essential for strong bones, muscle function, nerve transmission, and blood clotting. While dairy is a well-known source, many plant-based alternatives provide sufficient calcium for those on a dairy-free diet.

**Beyond Bone Health**

Calcium supports muscles, nerves, and blood clotting, not just bones. Inadequate intake can impair these functions, causing health issues.

**Debunking Myths**

Contrary to myths, many plant-based calcium sources are as effective as dairy. Studies show that calcium from kale and fortified soy milk is absorbed as efficiently as that from cow's milk.

**Top Plant-Based Calcium Sources**

\- Leafy Greens: Collard greens, kale, and broccoli rabe are rich in calcium. One cup of cooked collard greens provides 268 mg of calcium.

\- Seeds and Nuts: Chia seeds (179 mg/ounce) and almonds (76 mg/ounce) are excellent sources.

\- Legumes and Beans: White beans (161 mg/cup) and tofu (up to 434 mg/half-cup) are calcium-rich.

**Practical Tips**

Incorporate these foods into your diet to maintain adequate calcium levels without dairy. Always check labels on fortified foods for calcium content.

## What are the nighttime benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar?

1\. Healthy blood sugar levels The main ingredient in apple cider vinegar is acetic acid, which can stabilize blood sugar when you go to bed. ACV can significantly improve insulin resistance. It slows the breakdown of sugar and starches to reduce the insulin spike after eating.

2\. Better sleep One to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water before bed can help you sleep better.

3\. Improved digestion Apple cider vinegar can reduce bloating and improve digestion. This can improve sleep and eliminate heartburn at night.

4\. Improves mineral absorption Apple cider vinegar can improve the absorption of important minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and potassium. It can alleviate symptoms of magnesium deficiency like tetany or leg cramps by improving magnesium absorption. If your stomach is too alkaline, mineral absorption will be inhibited.

5\. Weight loss ACV helps you lose weight by increasing insulin sensitivity and improving insulin resistance.

6\. Improved liver detoxification ACV can improve liver detoxification and increase the release of bile. Bile improves the digestion of fat.

7\. ACV for fuel The body can use acetic acid as fuel. This won’t keep you up at night because it takes a good amount of energy to sleep restfully!

## What are the nutritional benefits of broccoli sprouts?

Broccoli sprouts have more sulforaphane than any other food on the planet.

Sulforaphane is one of the most studied phytonutrients. It has many health benefits. Most of all, it inhibits breast and prostate cancer and tumors. Sulforaphane is actually a defense mechanism of plants. If a bug or microbe begins to eat the plant, the sulforaphane can kill it.

In the human body, it can actually detoxify carcinogens, which are things that cause cancer. It’s also a powerful antioxidant, which may help decrease your risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, and autism.

Some people do have a sensitivity to plant foods that have high levels of sulforaphane—so if you notice adverse effects, don’t continue eating broccoli sprouts. However, most of the population won’t have a problem with them. One drawback is that broccoli sprouts can deplete your iodine. However, you can take some sea kelp to counter this effect.

I recommend that you consume broccoli sprouts raw—they have ten times the amount of sulforaphane raw.

## What are the nutritional benefits of cauliflower?

Cauliflower is a cruciferous vegetable that is naturally high in fiber and B vitamins. It is low in carbs and tastes something like potato. It feels like a starchy food but it doesn’t have starch.

**Benefits**

A great keto alternative to rice, pizza crust, mashed potatoes, tortilla, and mac and cheese

1. High in vitamin C
2. Contains choline (liver support)
3. Rich in nutrients
   * vitamin K1
   * vitamin B1
   * vitamin B2
   * vitamin B3
   * vitamin B5
   * folate
   * manganese
   * magnesium
   * potassium
   * trace minerals

5. sulforaphanes
6. glucosinolates
7. carotenoids
8. flavonoids
9. Contains DIM
   * balances estrogen ratios
   * supports natural detoxification
10. Low in carbs

**How to consume it**

You can eat it raw with dip or include it in your salad. Or cook it in a dozen ways.

There are many ways to prepare cauliflower. One favorite is to make it into pizza crust. Or you can find pre-made cauliflower crusts at the grocery store. Just be sure to check the label because sometimes the manufacturers slip in the ingredients like tapioca starch, dextrin and other things that aren’t keto-friendly.

Then there’s cauliflower rice. Nowadays you can find it at any grocery store because it’s become a mainstream product. It tastes almost identical to rice but without the starch.

Keep in mind that the longer you cook cauliflower, the more you destroy its nutrients. 3 minutes of boiling, for example, equals ten minutes of steaming. So steam it for just 5 minutes. Sauteing it is another recommended method. Ultimately, even if you cook it for a relatively long time, you still get the benefits of cauliflower’s low carbs and its fiber.

**Where to get it**

You can get it at any grocery store.

## What are the nutritional benefits of the bone broth?

Bone broth, sometimes called stock, is a liquid made from boiling animal bones and connective tissue. It’s actually a really good thing to consume because you are getting a lot of electrolytes and nutrition without a lot of calories.

People usually eat a lot of muscle from an animal, but not the rest of the animal. They eat a lot of meat from chicken, beef, lamb, and pork. The problem with this is that muscle is very high in methionine, an amino acid, whereas bone broth provides glycine with a different amino acid profile.

Bone broth is actually a really good thing to consume because you are getting a lot of electrolytes and nutrition without a lot of calories.

**Benefits:**

1. Can help with sleep
2. Can help lower blood sugars
3. Can help build up neurotransmitters in the body
4. Supports your gut
5. Supports your joints

**Simple bone broth recipe**

1\. Get three pounds of bones, preferably from a farmer’s market.

2\. Put two gallons of water in a pot, then add the bones.

3\. Add two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and let everything sit for 30 minutes so the acid can help break down the minerals in the bones.

4\. You can add herbs, spices, vegetables and sea salt.

5\. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 12 to 24 hours.

6\. The longer the broth simmers, the more nutrients are extracted. Your goal is to extract minerals, nutrients, collagen and amino acids from the bones.

7\. Let it all cool, then strain the solids from the liquid broth. Store the broth in glass jars.Use it in soups and stews.

**Where to get it**

You can also buy pre-made bone broth in a grocery store or order it online, for example the broth from a company called Kettle and Fire. They use animals that are grass-fed, pasture-raised and organic. They offer several flavors with excellent ingredients and no sugar or fillers. Their products are very keto-friendly.

## What are the physiological advantages of hydrochloric acid in gastric function and overall digestive health?

HCL is the most important fluid inside our body and without this acid in the stomach, our body will have a lot of problems.

The stomach acid needs to be very strong (acidic) preferably in the range of 1-3. If the stomach is less acidic it will not release pepsin (which is an enzyme for chemical reactions and is responsible for the breakdown of proteins).

**3 Major Health Benefits of Hydrochloric Acid**

1\. To help breakdown proteins

2\. Absorb minerals

3\. Kill microbes

Junk food, stress, antiacids, diarrhea, and vomiting can cause low stomach acid. And as we age, we lose our stomach acids, in fact, by age 70, we have only 25% of our stomach acids left.

**Low Stomach Acids Can Trigger:**

• Gas

• Indigestion

• Bloating

• Iron deficiency (anemia)

• Soft tissue calcium build-up

• Low B12

• Constipation

• Red cheeks

• SIBO (small intestine bacterial overgrowth)

• Leaky Gut

## What are the physiological and metabolic advantages conferred by maintaining optimal iron levels in the body?

Iron is a nutrient needed for several reasons. These include feeding good and bad bacteria. Iron helps to maintain many vital functions in the body, like general energy and focus, gastrointestinal processes, the immune system, and the regulation of body temperature.

The benefits of iron often go unnoticed until a person is not getting enough of it. Iron deficiency can cause fatigue, heart palpitations, pale skin and breathlessness.

**Benefits**

* Increases energy
* Increases focus
* Treats anemia
* Helps to maintain gastrointestinal processes
* Helps to maintain the immune system
* Supports the regulation of body temperature

**Symptoms of deficiency**

* Fatigue
* Paleness
* Brittle nails
* Breathing problems
* Grooved nails
* Hair loss / hair thinning
* Twitching
* Irritation
* PICA
* Dirt, chalk, ice cravings
* Restless leg syndrome

**Causes of deficiency**

* Excessive menstruation
* Ulcers
* Hemorrhoids
* Colon cancer
* Vegan diet
* Antibiotics
* Low stomach acidity
* Malabsorption
* Inflammation (the more chronic inflammation you have - the less iron in your body)

**Problems with too much iron**

Too much iron in the body is very dangerous to the mitochondria of the cells. It can create a lot of problems. When you combine free iron with oxygen, it forms a very powerful free radical that can damage the fat layer that surrounds the nervous system, called the myelin.

In the body, iron must be formed with protein. Too much Iron can also cause destruction to specific parts of the brain, specifically the hippocampus—which then can lead to dementia.

Here is some additional information on the negative effects of too much iron.

* Iron is attracted to damaged tissues in the body (brain, nerve, eye, liver and heart) and oxidizes them
* Oxidizes tissues (creates a rusting effect), including the fat layer around the nervous system cells, and the brain
* Accumulates in the body
* Body can’t get rid of it efficiently
* All bacteria need iron to survive (including bad ones)

**Where to get it**

* Seafood
* Red meat
* Poultry
* Eggs
* Insects
* Clams
* Liver
* Kidney and other organ meats
* Oysters
* Octopus
* Fish
* Eggs

## What are the physiological and metabolic benefits associated with leptin, and how does this hormone influence body weight regulation and energy balance?

Leptin is a hormone produced by fat cells. It sends signals through the blood to tell the body that you’re full. So leptin is a satiety hormone—it lets your brain know that it’s time to stop eating. If you have a hard time feeling full or satisfied, it could be that your leptin levels are too low.

Additionally, since your fat cells make leptin, the more body fat you have, the higher the levels of leptin that you should have. In theory, it would mean that the fatter you are, the more satisfied you should be. However, this is not the case. When you have an excessive amount of leptin, your leptin receptors begin to develop a resistance to it. This is very similar to insulin resistance. Those who are obese have a lot of leptin, but it is unavailable to their body. In turn, this condition brings a lot of hunger all day long.

The only way to restore leptin sensitivity is to lose weight so you can maintain a healthy leptin level.

## What are the physiological and metabolic benefits attributed to intermittent hypoxic training, and how might this training modality influence overall health and performance?

Intermittent hypoxic training is a training or therapy that is very similar to training at high altitudes. You are intermittently giving your body lower amounts of oxygen.

By giving your body little doses of hypoxia, which means a lack of oxygen, you can create an amazing adaptation. You’re giving a small amount of stress intermittently to cause the body to rebound, adapt and become even stronger.

**Benefits**

* Improved performance
* May help with chronic lung disease
* May help with bronchial asthma
* May help with hypertension
* May help with diabetes
* May help with brain damage
* May help with radiation toxicity
* Increases your antioxidant network
* Increases the number of mitochondria
* May increase the number and size of red blood cells
* Helps release excessive amounts of calcium from the cells
* Increases oxygen to the tissues
* Decreases oxidative stress

**How to do intermittent hypoxic training**

You can get intermittent hypoxic training equipment—such as a small mask that fits over your nose and mouth. The mask restricts air and has different settings that will simulate different altitudes. You may start at 3,000 ft. and slowly work your way up to 19,000 ft. If you reduce the oxygen so it’s too low or reduce it for too long, it could be dangerous.

One pattern might look like this: 3 to 5 minutes of hypoxic air, where you’re breathing more CO2. Then, 2 to 5 minutes of ambient air (normal air). You might do these, back and forth, for about 45 minutes.

There is another method where you’re on a bicycle, and you’re breathing in a lesser amount of oxygen and more nitrogen.

You can also get a pulse oximeter, which will measure the amount of oxygen in your blood.

## What are the physiological mechanisms by which hyaluronic acid functions in the body?

It's essential to consider your starting point if you consider using this as a supplement. Consider that an average 45-year-old adult might have between 14-15 grams of hyaluronic acid in their body.

By age 80, this number drops considerably, usually closer to 3.6 grams. This drastic reduction highlights why incorporating foods and supplements that help replenish hyaluronic acid as you age can be essential.

Bone broth and organ meats are great sources of this vital nutrient. More often than not, a dose of 200 milligrams per day is a great starting point to experience the many hyaluronic acid benefits.

It's also important to remember that, as with anything, moderation is key. A word of caution: Avoid going overboard and exceeding the recommended daily amount.

A friend of mine decided to take incredibly high doses because he thought, "if a little is good, a lot must be better." He ended up taking close to 3,000-4,000 milligrams per day.

Remember how I mentioned hyaluronic acid swells up as it absorbs water? Well, since he consumed such a large amount, he began experiencing quite a few severe side effects.

This compound was essentially swelling up in his body. In the end, he found drinking straight brandy helped dissolve it, and eventually, he felt much better. Of course, this isn't something I would recommend doing.

## What are the potential benefits of incorporating rebounding exercises into a fitness routine?

**Rebounding exercise is essentially jumping on a trampoline. There are quite a few benefits that come from it.**

NASA has done a lot of research on rebounding exercise. When you’re in space without gravity, you begin to lose your bone tissue and muscle tissue. Rebounding exercise is designed to counter these problems.

**A big benefit of rebounding is its ability to stimulate the lymphatic system.** Some of the plasma in your blood leaks out of your tissues and goes into the lymphatic system. This means that the lymph in your lymphatic system is made up of plasma along with other substances. The plasma eventually returns to the bloodstream. Interestingly, your lymphatic system doesn’t have a pump as the vascular system does. This means that you have to move your body for your lymph to circulate through your body.

**Aside from transporting plasma, the lymphatic system has two other significant roles: to support the immune system and to transport fat throughout the body.** When you consume dietary fat, it goes through the lymphatic system. Since fat and water do not mix, your body has to package the fat—using something called chylomicrons—so it can be transported easily in the lymph fluid. By the lymph fluid, the fat is carried throughout the body to be used for energy and the creation of hormones, cells and bile.

Many people have found that rebounding exercise has restored their energy. This is the true benefit of rebound exercise.

**Benefits**

* It is convenient
* Helps mobility
* Helps posture
* Helps balance
* Helps with fear of falling
* Reduces risk of osteoporosis
* Stimulates the thyroid and lymphatic system

* Protects skin against UV radiation from the sun
* Good for vitiligo

**Where to get it**

* Organic meats
* Dairy
* Eggs
* Vegetables

## What are the potential benefits of probiotics for managing and reducing dandruff, and how do they contribute to scalp health?

**The cause of dandruff is still unknown, but there are theories as to what causes it.**

**What we know about dandruff:**

• Dandruff occurs more in the winter

• People who have dandruff typically have more of a vitamin D deficiency

• Dandruff is an imbalance between the fungus and the bacteria on the skin

• One type of fungus on the skin (malassezia) has more than doubled when you have dandruff

• There is an increase of staph bacteria on the skin when you have dandruff

• Antibiotics may help temporarily

• Steroids may help temporarily (but can suppress the immune system)

• People with dandruff typically have a zinc deficiency

Mycobiota is the friendly fungus and the yeast that grow inside and outside of the body. It’s an area that is rarely studied, but I believe it’s very important.

**Friendly fungus and yeast are very beneficial—they do a lot for us. But they need to be in the right balance. There are a lot of conditions that can occur if a person doesn’t have the right balance of fungus and bacteria.**

In my opinion, I think what’s really going on with dandruff is an imbalance of the friendly fungus and friendly bacteria. I don’t believe the solution is to start using chemicals and steroids to kill off the fungus or bacteria. Instead, I think a great remedy for dandruff is a natural antibiotic and a natural anti-fungal.

**Potential remedies for dandruff:**

1\. Garlic and oregano (take orally)

2\. A probiotic that also has friendly yeast

## What are the potential drawbacks and adverse effects associated with medications that increase dopamine levels?

### **The Downside of Medications Increasing Dopamine Levels**

More isn't always preferable when it comes to dopamine, a chemical messenger that affects our disposition and enthusiasm. Certain medications aim to boost these levels but can lead us down a tricky path.

#### **Potential Side Effects of Dopamine-Increasing Medications**

While dopamine-increasing drugs may seem like the perfect solution for low energy or lackluster moods, they're not without their pitfalls.

While beneficial in some cases, these medications can cause side effects such as motivational disorders and paranoia.

This means you might feel motivated one minute and paranoid the next - not exactly what we signed up for.

But wait, there's more: unexpected lactation is another potential surprise package from these meds. Imagine being at work when your shirt suddenly becomes damp – awkward.

A further issue with these drugs is their potential for addiction. Anyone who has ever tried quitting coffee knows how hard it can be. In much the same way, reliance on dopamine-boosting medication could lead to addictive behaviors.

## What are the potential health benefits associated with strontium supplementation?

Strontium is a powerful trace mineral whose chemistry is similar to calcium. It’s particularly helpful in building a strong outer shell on your bones, along with preventing hip fractures. The missing mineral that many people need to strengthen their bones is strontium, however, since it’s a trace mineral, you only need it in small amounts compared to calcium.

**Benefits**

* Good for bones and bone problems
* Can decrease the risk of bone fractures by up to 41%
* Good for osteoporosis or osteopenia

**How to consume it**

You need strontium and calcium in a 1:1000 ratio, where 1 is strontium and 1000 is calcium.

Consume strontium along with calcium aspartate anhydrous, vitamin D3, vitamin K2 and magnesium to support your bones and tackle any bone problem.

In addition to those nutrients, you need to have a sufficient amount of stomach acid to readily absorb minerals. Consume apple cider vinegar with each meal. You know that your stomach isn’t acidic enough if you have heartburn, acid reflux, or GERD.

If you have osteoporosis or osteopenia, it can take one to six years to regain your bone health. But it’s possible when you eat healthy foods and give your body the raw materials it needs.

**Where to get it**

Strontium doesn’t come in a form that’s easily absorbed by your body. Strontium is what’s called an elemental, inorganic mineral. Instead, you need the organic, plant-based form of it. Don’t take the elemental form.

One of the good sources of strontium is sea salt (can be found at the grocery store). You can also get it in a supplement form from a health food store or online.

## What are the potential health benefits associated with the daily consumption of cloves?

**Clove is natural, and there is a lot of interesting research on using it to promote a healthy body. One of the most common ways to use clove is as a numbing agent for a toothache.** The essential oil in clove called eugenol produces many benefits. But it also contains a lot of other phytonutrients.

You can use clove oil or simply chew and swallow a piece of clove. You can also use clove oil topically on the scalp for fungus or pathogens. It may even help reduce the toxicity created as a byproduct of fungus.

* Clove may help enhance the effects of an antibiotic, allowing you to use lower amounts of it.
* Clove oil may also help inhibit H. pylori and improve peptic ulcers, gastritis, indigestion, gas, and bloating.
* A certain phytonutrient in clove is an MAO inhibitor. MAO inhibitors are used as antidepressants.
* Clove even has anti-inflammatory effects, and data shows it has anticancer properties.

**Clove is relatively safe, but consuming too much clove oil could create a toxic effect. You should avoid clove if you are allergic to it or are pregnant or lactating.**

## What are the potential health benefits of lycopene consumption?

Lycopene is a vital phytonutrient (healthy substance found in plants) that is contained in certain foods like tomatoes and grapefruit.

**Benefits**

* Can be good for an enlarged prostate
* May support healthy blood pressure
* Can act as a blood thinner
* Can help in the regulation of blood lipids
* Can act as anti-inflammatory
* A powerful antioxidant
* Helps boost detoxification in the body
* Has some antitumor properties
* Can help protect against things like hydrogen peroxide

**Where to get it**

The ability of lycopene to be absorbed and concentrated in the body increases when you heat the substance. For example, if you consumed tomato paste, you would get about 4x more lycopene than if you consumed raw tomatoes.

Additionally, olive oil increases the absorption of lycopene even more. This is because lycopene is a fat-soluble phytonutrient, so it requires bile to absorb it. Therefore, adding fat to a meal containing lycopene can help support the absorption of it.

**Sources of lycopene:**

* Tomatoes
* Grapefruit
* Goji berries
* Gac
* Asparagus
* Parsley
*   Basil

## What are the potential health benefits of methylene blue, and how does it impact various physiological functions?

Methylene blue is sold over the counter and has been around for a very long time. It was the first fully synthetic drug in medicine, one of the first antibiotics, and one of the first antipsychotic drugs. It was also used for malaria and is currently used for cyanide poisoning and carbon monoxide poisoning. In low doses, methylene blue acts as an antioxidant.

**Methylene blue can potentially help with certain conditions, including:**

• Septic shock

• Anaphylaxis

• Viruses

• Fatigue

• Brain fog

• Memory loss

• Depression

• Candida

• Nerve degeneration

• Gout

• Mitochondrial dysfunction

• Inflammation

If you decide to try methylene blue, I suggest getting the USP pharmaceutical grade one percent solution. This will give you about 0.5 mg per drop. Someone taking an SSRI would not want to take methylene blue. Check with your doctor before taking something like this for any other contraindications.

This natural herb has been used for thousands of years in Chinese medicine. The synthetic version of wormwood is the most effective treatment for malaria. There is also some interesting research on wormwood for COVID.

**Other potential benefits of wormwood:**

• It’s anti-parasitic

• It may be effective against worms, viruses, bacteria, and Lyme disease

• It’s anti-viral

**What we’re going to focus on today, though, is its effectiveness against cancer.**

**Potential benefits of wormwood for cancer patients:**

1\. It can selectively cause apoptosis in cancer cells.

2\. It oxidizes a small amount of your iron, turning it into a free radical and directing it to the cancer cell. Oxidized iron is toxic to cancer cells.

3\. The phytonutrients in wormwood can inhibit a certain protein complex involved in the process of normal cells converting into cancer cells.

4\. It can inhibit normal cells from producing an increase in blood vessels to a tumor.

5\. It’s anti-inflammatory and may help stop the formation and spread of cancer. 6. It has an anti-metastatic effect, which means it may help inhibit the growth of cancer.

## What are the potential health implications of alkalizing the body, and how does this approach influence systemic pH balance and overall physiological function?

The alkaline-cancer myth is that if you alkalize your body, you will be better protected against cancer. This is not true.

The first question you have to ask is, what part of the body are they even talking about? The stomach, intestines, saliva, urine, and blood all have different pH levels. Are they saying that you need to alkalize the entire body? This would cause devastating effects.

It’s true that tumors grow faster in an acidic environment; however, tumors and cancers make an acidic environment.

No studies show that alkalizing the body will reduce the risk of cancer.

Cruciferous vegetables are incredible for lowering the risk of cancer. The nutrients in cruciferous vegetables help cut off the blood supply to cancerous cells, making it far more difficult for them to live and replicate.

## What are the potential reasons and considerations for avoiding the use of valerian root before sleep?

**Valerian Root: Helps with Anxiety, Not So Much with Sleep**

Valerian root is a natural herb with calming effects. It works similarly to medications like Valium by influencing GABA, a neurotransmitter that reduces stress and promotes relaxation. This can be helpful for anxiety, but there's a catch:

* **Valerian's Sedative Effects:** While it calms anxiety, valerian can cause drowsiness, sluggishness, even insomnia for some. It's NOT a reliable sleep aid.

**Getting to the Root Cause**

Anxiety and sleep problems are often symptoms of deeper imbalances:

* **Hormones:** High cortisol (the stress hormone) is a major culprit.
* **Melatonin/Serotonin Connection:** Low melatonin affects sleep, and can also contribute to low serotonin, linked to depression.

**Natural Solutions: Beyond Supplements**

While you CAN supplement melatonin, it's best to support your body's own production. Here's how:

1. **Exercise:** Gets your body primed for healthy sleep cycles.
2. **Sunlight:** Infrared rays naturally boost melatonin.
3. **Vitamin B1:** Found in nutritional yeast, sunflower seeds. Supports overall nervous system health.
4. **Gut Health:** Probiotics support the production of calming neurotransmitters.
5. **Diet:** Healthy keto and intermittent fasting can benefit hormone balance.

**Important:**

* Valerian may interact with medications. Talk to your doctor before using.
* Lifestyle changes take time but have lasting benefits.

## What are the potential risks or side effects of consuming ashwagandha, particularly regarding its effects on health and medication interactions?

Ashwagandha is a powerful herb that helps to reduce stress and anxiety. Along with stress management, ashwagandha has numerous potential health benefits, including the following:

•Reduces nervousness

•Helps reduce cortisol

•Increases VO2 max

•Increases testosterone

•Improves sleep

•Improves recovery

•Lowers blood sugar

•Helps improve insulin resistance

However, there are some things to consider before taking ashwagandha. Avoid ashwagandha if you have a hyperthyroid condition like Graves' disease because ashwagandha speeds up the thyroid. Because it lowers blood pressure, it’s best to avoid ashwagandha if your blood pressure is already on the low side. If you have low cortisol, you won’t want to push it even lower with ashwagandha. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also avoid ashwagandha.

Don't take ashwagandha if you’re sensitive to nightshades or have a genetic problem that causes you to have too much iron. If you take too much ashwagandha for too long, some people describe feeling no emotion or feeling numb. Most people who experience adverse ashwagandha side effects have taken it for too long and in high doses. Consider keeping your ashwagandha intake at around 600 mg daily, broken into two 300 mg doses. It’s also best to limit your intake to two months at a time.

## What are the potential therapeutic benefits and medicinal applications of quinine bark?

The best remedy for leg cramps at night is quinine bark. I’m not talking about the synthetic version that you need a prescription for. This is about the natural bark, which contains a lot less of the active ingredient, quinine. People have been using quinine bark as a remedy for numerous health issues for hundreds and hundreds of years. This natural bark was forgotten about for a while, after the synthetic version came out. However, quinine bark has made a huge comeback recently.

**Benefits**

* Prevents leg cramps at night
* Used for malaria
* Used for parasites
* Used for viruses
* Used for fever reduction
* Used for pain reduction
* Used for heartbeat regulation
* Used for digestion

**Where to get it**

## What are the potential therapeutic benefits of vitamin E supplementation in the context of hepatic health and liver disease management?

There is a condition called NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), which is basically a fatty liver that has some inflammation. There have been many studies on using vitamin E for NASH.

Vitamin E has demonstrated significant improvement in:

1\. Steatosis (the fatty liver portion)

2\. Inflammation

3\. Ballooning of the liver cells (degeneration)

Essentially, vitamin E may have the power to reduce the fat, inflammation, and the death of the liver cells in adult patients with NASH that don’t have diabetes or cirrhosis. In one study, they used a natural version of only one part of the vitamin E complex. However, it may be beneficial to have the whole complex. They also used 800 IUs of this one part. Other studies have used up to 1000 IUs, while others only used 400 IUs. Between 800 and 1000 IUs may be the best idea.

Vitamin E may help stop the transition of going from having a fatty liver to an inflamed liver. It’s a very powerful antioxidant that may help calm free radicle damage, prevent inflammation, and prevent fibrosis.

Taking vitamin E alone may not change anything very much. But, changing the diet as well may make a more significant difference. The healthy keto diet with intermittent fasting may be the best way to go. Adding vitamin C in a food complex with choline may also be beneficial.

## What are the quickest methods to relieve bloating immediately?

You can try consuming fewer foods to help isolate what’s causing you to bloat the most. It’s important to consider what you ate just before you noticed you were bloated. This will give you a big clue as to what’s causing you to bloat.

One of the best things to do for bloating is intermittent fasting. The more frequently you eat, the more bloating problems you’ll have. Gas produced by microbes in your gut can also cause bloating. When trying to get rid of bloating, avoiding certain things is way more important than taking certain things.

**Common foods to avoid to help with bloating:**

• Fruit

• Beans

• Grains

• Refined sugars

• Sugar alcohols

• Starches

• Maltodextrin or dextrin

• Functional fibers

• Prebiotics

• Gluten

• Lactose

• Casein

• Nuts or nut butter

• Vegetables

**Other potential causes of bloating:**

• Stress

• Constipation

• Menstrual cramps

## What are the reasons for avoiding synthetic vitamins, particularly in comparison to their natural counterparts, when considering health and nutrient absorption?

**Synthetic vs. Natural Vitamins: What's the Difference?**

Synthetic and natural vitamins are fundamentally different. Natural vitamins exist within complex structures in food. While isolated natural vitamins are better than synthetic versions, there are specific instances where synthetic vitamins may be temporarily useful.

**When Synthetic Vitamins May Be Used:**

* **Short-term detox programs:** May sometimes include synthetic vitamins.
* **Benfotiamine:** A fat-soluble form of vitamin B1 (thiamine) with minimal side effects.

**Why Natural Vitamins Are Usually Superior:**

* **Safety:** Synthetic vitamins have a higher potential for toxicity and can even cause deficiencies.
* **Structure:** Synthetic vitamins are isolated fractions, lacking the natural components of whole-food vitamins.
* **Absorption:** Natural vitamins are more readily absorbed and utilized by your body.
* **Cofactors:** Natural vitamins come with essential cofactors, enzymes, and trace minerals that enhance their function.

**Spotting Truly Natural Vitamins:**

The best way is to examine the ingredients list:

* **Natural/Whole-food:** Look for terms like "herb-based" or "concentrated food."
* **Synthetic:** Ingredients will list individual vitamins with identical dosages (e.g., B1 - 100mg, B2 - 100mg, etc.).

**A Note on Liver:**

Liver pills are an exception, but excessive consumption (whether food or pills) can lead to iron or vitamin A overload.

## What are the signs that you may benefit from taking purified bile salts, and how can they address specific health concerns?

Individuals without a gallbladder may experience deficiencies in fat-soluble nutrients, leading to various health issues.

**Identifying Nutrient Deficiencies from Impaired Fat Absorption**

\- Vitamin A Deficiency: Symptoms include difficulty seeing at night (night blindness), dry skin, and frequent infections.

\- Vitamin D Deficiency: Weak bones, muscle pain, and fatigue are common indicators of low vitamin D levels due to poor fat digestion.

\- Hormonal Imbalances: Since hormones like estrogen and testosterone are derived from fats, compromised fat absorption can cause mood swings, irregular periods (in women), and decreased libido.

\- Inflammation: Inadequate levels of vitamins D and E can lead to chronic inflammation, which is linked to heart disease, asthma, and autoimmune disorders.

**Benefits of Using Purified Bile Salts Without a Gallbladder**

Purified bile salts supplements can enhance the body's ability to digest dietary fats effectively. Benefits include:

\- Improved Fat Digestion: Bile salts aid in breaking down fats into smaller particles, facilitating easier processing by pancreatic enzymes.

\- Better Absorption of Fat-Soluble Vitamins: Enhanced fat breakdown promotes better absorption of essential vitamins A, D, E, and K.

\- Hormone Balance Support: Improved fat digestion can contribute to more balanced hormone levels, as many hormones are derived from fats.

If you suspect impaired fat absorption due to a missing or non-functioning gallbladder, consult a healthcare professional about your symptoms and the potential benefits of purified bile salt supplements. They can provide personalized guidance on whether supplementation is right for you.

_**We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**_

Leech therapy has been around for a very long time. In this therapy, leeches pierce a person’s skin with their teeth and insert anticoagulants through their saliva. They are then allowed to extract blood for 20 to 45 minutes at a time. This equates to a relatively small amount of blood: up to 15 milliliters per leech.

In 2004, the FDA approved medical leeches as a medical device in plastic and reconstructive surgery. In the saliva of leeches, there are over 100 bioactive substances with a wide range of effects.

**Benefits**

* Anti-coagulating effect
* Blood-thinning effect
* Vasodilating effect (widening blood vessels)
* Anesthetic effect
* Antibiotic effect

**Conditions people use leech therapy for**

* Venous congestion
* Cardiovascular problems
* Arthritis
* High blood pressure
* Hemorrhoids
* Blood clots
* Skin diseases
* In stroke patients and heart attack patients, leeches help reduce the clotting mechanism

## What are the therapeutic benefits and potential advantages of incorporating Rhodiola into a health regimen?

Rhodiola is an adaptogen, which is a type of herb that helps you adapt to stress. It’s been suggested that rhodiola has a really interesting effect of significantly reducing perceived effort after exercise.

Rhodiola has a lot of potential benefits and may help with certain issues, including:

• Stress

• Coughing

• Fatigue

• Depression

• Altitude sickness

• Tissue and organ damage from hypoxia

Rhodiola may even help support cognitive function as well as improve HRV and angina pain. In one study, people who took rhodiola had more energy after exercise than those who had a placebo. Sleep is a huge factor when it comes to recovery from stress and exercise. It just so happens that rhodiola may help support healthy sleep cycles. One study even suggested that your body may need less sleep to get rejuvenated when taking rhodiola.

Rhodiola may also help increase glycogen reserves (stored fuel) and ATP (energy).

## What are the therapeutic benefits of inositol in the management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)?

PCOS occurs when the androgen male sex hormones are too high in a women’s body. Symptoms include growing facial hair, developing belly fat, and hair loss on your head. You might get a deeper voice.

High levels of androgen are caused by high levels of insulin. So of course you want to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to lower your insulin levels. But there’s a little more to it.

There’s a vitamin called inositol that’s part of the vitamin B family. Interestingly, if you suck on it, it tastes sweet. Inositol is involved in sugar metabolism. Inositol is actually nine different vitamin B compounds, Two of the nine versions are called MYO and D-chiro. I and others believe that in women with PCOS, the MYO doesn’t convert to the d-chiro. So on top of the high levels of insulin and androgens, this contributes to the problem.

When you give women with PCOS a 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, their symptoms improve, as does their fertility, weight loss, acne, and the quality of their eggs. Find an inositol supplement that has this 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, to further enhance the benefits of keto and intermittent fasting. Inositol alone won’t completely help. You’ve got to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to get your insulin levels low enough to stop driving up your androgen levels.

## What are the therapeutic benefits of laxatives?

Laxatives are herbs and medicines that produce bowel movements and relieve constipation. People often say they don’t want to take a laxative because they may be addictive (after taking them regularly for some time, your colon muscles lose strength and can become dependent on them). But the toxic effect of having chronic constipation can be very dangerous to the body compared to the minor side effects of taking a laxative.

**Side effects**

In addition to the colon developing an addiction to laxatives, you might experience a small drop in potassium from taking a laxative, but you can easily take more potassium to replenish it. Ultimately, you want to correct what’s really causing the constipation, which usually is either the food you’re eating or a lack of friendly bacteria.

**Laxatives can have these side effects:**

* They can be addictive

They can deplete electrolytes, like potassium (in this case, you would want to add the electrolytes back)

**How to consume them**

If you have constipation, as a coping mechanism take a herbal natural laxative like cascara sagrada. This should give you constipation relief while you figure out what’s really causing the condition.

**Where to get them**

Here is a list of the best natural laxatives:

* Senna
* Cascara sagrada
* Black psyllium (swells with water)
* Castor oil
* Magnesium
* Fermented vegetables
* Probiotics
* MCT oil
* Bile salts
* Vitamin B1
* Probiotics
*   Fasting

## What are the three best foods for hair loss, and how do they promote hair health and growth?

A study has shown that over 90 percent of people suffering from alopecia are deficient in an amino acid called histidine. This essential amino acid is a precursor to histamine, which plays a vital role in immune reactions, allergies, and inflammation.

Deficiencies in histidine can lead to anemia, while excessive intake can cause premature ejaculation. However, the right amount of histidine in your diet can promote healthy hair growth by helping to produce keratin and regulating copper and zinc levels.

Certain medications and alcohol consumption may lower histidine levels in the body, while inadequate stomach acid can hinder its absorption from food sources. To counter this issue, betaine hydrochloride can be taken as an acidifier.

But to fully utilize histidine, specific co-factors must be present, such as vitamin B6, proper copper and zinc ratios, and folate.

The top three foods that can help combat hair loss are

1\. Organ meats, including liver, due to the histidine and other essential nutrients they contain.

2\. Animal proteins, such as beef and chicken, are rich in histidine and other amino acids necessary for hair regeneration.

3\. Shellfish, particularly shrimp, scallops, and crabs, provide high levels of zinc and copper that can help maintain proper ratios in the body.

It's important to note that having enough folate in your diet is essential for hair development. It's best to obtain folate from natural sources, as taking supplements such as folic acid may inhibit the conversion of histidine into its active form.

## What are the various benefits associated with the supplementation of creatine powder, particularly in relation to athletic performance and overall health?

The benefits of creatine powder, as highlighted in the provided context, span across various aspects of health and fitness. Here's a detailed look at the key benefits:

1. **Enhanced Muscle Strength and Power**: Creatine is renowned for its ability to increase the body's capacity to perform high-intensity activities. This is achieved through the recycling of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is crucial for muscle contractions. This process supports sustained energy production within muscle cells during short bursts of intense exercise, thereby enhancing overall strength and power.
2. **Promotes Muscle Gain**: Creatine powder draws water into muscle cells, contributing to muscle growth and improved muscle volume. This effect not only aids in achieving a more muscular appearance but also supports the muscle-building process by enhancing the synthesis of proteins that form new muscle fibers.
3. **Faster Exercise Recovery**: Supplementing with creatine has been found to reduce muscle damage and inflammation following intense workouts. By replenishing ATP in muscle cells post-exercise, creatine facilitates more efficient muscle repair and growth. This quicker recovery allows for more frequent and intense training sessions, contributing to better performance and muscle gains over time.
4. **Neuroprotective Effects**: Beyond its muscle-enhancing properties, creatine has shown potential benefits for brain health. It may play a role in the treatment of neurological disorders and support cognitive function due to its ability to increase ATP concentrations in brain tissue. This increase in energy supply can aid in maintaining neuronal health and balanced neurotransmitter levels, which are essential for effective communication between brain cells.
5. **Supports Brain Function**: Creatine's ability to boost ATP production extends to the brain, where it can enhance cognitive function, particularly under conditions of stress or sleep deprivation. This makes creatine beneficial not only for physical performance but also for tasks requiring mental sharpness.

In summary, creatine powder offers a versatile range of benefits, from improving muscle strength and accelerating recovery to potentially supporting brain health. Its role in increasing ATP production is central to its effectiveness in both physical and cognitive domains.

## What are your views on bioidentical hormone creams?

Bioidentical hormone creams come with certain considerations. When you take hormones, it raises the question of why your glands aren't producing enough naturally. While aging can be a factor, the body, particularly the adrenal glands, should ideally compensate. Relying on external hormones can lead to reduced natural production and increased dependency. A better approach might be to strengthen the glands, particularly the adrenal glands, using desiccated adrenal support or adaptogens like ashwagandha to encourage natural hormone production.

## What benefits might come from recognizing and managing delirium, given its indication of underlying medical issues?

There are other causes of emotional instability that have nothing to do with nutrition as well. But, I want to talk about the nutrient connection to your emotions. I believe the best vitamin for emotional instability may be vitamin B1.

If you’re deficient in vitamin B1, you could experience emotional instability and delirium. Delirium is mental confusion and emotional disruption. Delirium can also often occur when an alcoholic or drug addict is going through withdrawal symptoms.

**There are certain specific parts of the brain that require B1:**

• The hippocampus

• The Amygdala

• The mammillary bodies

The RDAs for vitamin B1 is only 2mg. Vitamin B1 is water-soluble, so you don’t store a lot of it. You’re body only needs a small amount of it, but it needs it consistently. You will need more vitamin B1 if you consume carbs. The more carbohydrates or sugar you consume, the more vitamin B1 you’ll need.

**Things that can deplete vitamin B1:**

• Glucose

• Stress

• Chlorine

• Refined foods

**Other vitamin B1 deficiency symptoms:**

1\. Irritability

2\. Depression

3\. Anxiety

4\. Confusion

5\. Memory loss

6\. Lack of initiative

7\. Poor learning

8\. Poor concentration

The best source of vitamin B1 is nutritional yeast. If you’re going to buy a vitamin B1 supplement, a natural version over a synthetic version may be the best way to go. But, unfortified or unenriched nutritional yeast should have enough vitamin B1.

## What brand of beef liver supplement does Dr. Berg recommend?

**Beef Liver Supplements: A Nutrient Powerhouse**

While Dr. Berg doesn't have a specific brand recommendation for **beef liver supplements**, he emphasizes the importance of finding a product that is both **grass-fed and grass-finished**. This ensures you're getting the highest quality supplement with the most beneficial nutrient profile.

Beef liver is truly a superfood, packed with an incredible array of vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients. It's an excellent natural source of:

* **Vitamin A (Retinol):** Crucial for vision, immune function, and skin health.
* **B Vitamins (especially B12, Folate, Riboflavin):** Vital for energy production, nerve function, and red blood cell formation.

**Best Practices for Buying Beef Liver Supplements:**

When you're looking to purchase a beef liver supplement, here are the key recommendations to ensure you're getting a top-quality product:

1. **Grass-Fed and Grass-Finished:** This is the most crucial factor. "Grass-fed" means the cattle ate grass for most of their lives, but "grass-finished" means they continued to eat grass right up until harvest. This ensures a superior nutrient profile and avoids grains that can impact the animal's health and the quality of the liver.
2. **Desiccated (Freeze-Dried):** Look for supplements that are "desiccated" or "freeze-dried." This gentle drying process preserves the heat-sensitive vitamins, enzymes, and cofactors naturally found in raw liver, retaining its nutritional integrity.
3. **No Fillers:** A high-quality beef liver supplement should contain only beef liver.
4. **Non-GMO and Hormone-Free:** Ensure the product comes from animals not treated with hormones or antibiotics, and that their feed (if any, though grass-finished is ideal) is non-GMO.
5. **Third-Party Tested:** Reputable brands will often have their products third-party tested for purity, potency, and to ensure they are free from heavy metals or other contaminants. Look for this information on the product label or the company's website.

By focusing on these criteria, you can confidently choose a high-quality beef liver supplement to support your nutritional needs!

* **Organic Certification:** Look for products that are certified organic to ensure they are free from pesticides, herbicides, and other harmful chemicals. Dandelions are often sprayed as weeds, so this is particularly important.
* **Third-Party Testing:** Products that undergo third-party testing by independent labs can verify purity, potency, and absence of contaminants (like heavy metals or microbes). Look for mentions of **Certificates of Analysis (COA)**.
* **Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Certification:** This indicates that the product is consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards.
* **Sourcing:** While dandelions grow widely, some brands might highlight their sourcing practices, such as wild-harvested or cultivated in specific regions.

**4. Dosage and Concentration**

* **Clear Dosage Instructions:** The product label should provide clear recommended serving sizes and frequency.
* **Potency/Strength:** For extracts or concentrated forms, the potency (e.g., standardized extract, extract ratio) can indicate how concentrated the beneficial compounds are.
* **Daily Value (if applicable):** While not always available for herbal supplements, if a product includes specific vitamins or minerals from the dandelion, check the % Daily Value.

**5. Other Ingredients**

* **Fillers and Additives:** Check the "Other Ingredients" list. Look for products with minimal fillers, artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives.
* **Vegetable Capsules:** If you prefer a plant-based product, ensure the capsules are made from vegetable cellulose.

**6. Potential Side Effects and Interactions**

* **Medication Interactions:** Dandelion may interact with certain medications. Please consult your healthcare professional before use.
* **Pregnancy/Breastfeeding:** There isn't enough reliable information on safety during pregnancy or breastfeeding, so it's best to avoid or consult a doctor.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement, especially if you have existing health conditions or are taking medications.** They can help you determine if dandelion is appropriate for you and advise on safe dosages.

## What brand of L-Lysine does Dr. Berg recommend?

### L-Lysine: A Powerful Amino Acid for Viral Support and Hair Health

While Dr. Berg doesn't have a specific brand recommendation for **L-Lysine**, this essential amino acid is highly beneficial, especially for those managing **herpes (Type 1 or 2)** and **shingles viruses**, and even for **hair health**.

**L-Lysine for Viral Management:**

Herpes and shingles viruses often flare up after significant stress. These viruses rely on another amino acid, **arginine**, to reproduce. L-lysine works by **blocking arginine**, effectively stopping the replication of these viruses and potentially helping to put them into remission.

* **During an outbreak:** For intense conditions, a dosage of **3,000 mg of L-lysine** may be recommended.
* **For prevention:** A much smaller, preventative amount can be taken regularly.
* **Dietary considerations:** To further support your body, focus on consuming foods high in L-lysine while trying to limit foods high in arginine.

**L-Lysine for Hair Growth and Strength:**

Hair is primarily made of protein, which is composed of amino acids. L-lysine is a specific amino acid that can **significantly impact hair growth**, making it stronger and more elastic.

**Tips When Purchasing L-Lysine:**

When you're looking to buy an L-lysine supplement, here are a few tips to consider:

1. **Form:** Look for L-lysine in its free-form, which is easily absorbed by the body.
2. **Purity:** Choose products with minimal fillers and artificial ingredients. Reputable brands will often list their "other ingredients" clearly.
3. **Dosage:** Check the per-serving dosage to ensure it aligns with your needs (e.g., if you're aiming for 1000-3000mg, see how many capsules or tablets that requires).
4. **Certifications:** While not always necessary, third-party certifications can indicate quality and purity.
5. **Reviews:** Look at customer reviews from various sources to gauge product effectiveness and satisfaction.
6. **"L-" prefix:** Ensure it's specifically "L-Lysine" as this is the biologically active form the body uses.

## What brand of melatonin does Dr. Berg recommend?

**Melatonin: Beyond Just Sleep**

While Dr. Berg doesn't have a specific brand recommendation for **melatonin**, it's important to understand that its benefits extend far beyond just being a sleep aid.

It's true that your body naturally produces melatonin, and you can support these levels through diet and lifestyle. We'll get into those tips shortly. However, I'm not recommending that you take melatonin supplements unless you're using it for a specific condition, as your body is designed to make its own.

**Surprising Benefits of Melatonin**

Here are 12 lesser-known but significant benefits of melatonin you should be aware of:

1. Acts as a **potent antioxidant**.
2. **Improves the immune system**.
3. **Reduces inflammation**.
4. **Decreases headaches**.
5. Helps **fight against cancer**.
6. Helps **protect your brain and memory**.
7. **Decreases Luteinizing Hormone (LH)**, which is linked to Alzheimer's disease.
8. **Improves GERD symptoms**.
9. **Lowers anxiety**.
10. Helps **fight depression**.
11. **Stabilizes blood sugars**.

For the therapeutic benefit of lowering Luteinizing Hormone, Dr. Berg suggests a higher dosage: **75 mg for women and 125 mg for men**.

**How to Naturally Boost Your Melatonin Levels**

You can significantly improve your body's natural melatonin production through these lifestyle adjustments:

* **Avoid light at night:** This includes bright overhead lights.
* **Get plenty of sun and vitamin D during the day:** Exposure to natural light during the day helps regulate your circadian rhythm.
* **Decrease your exposure to blue light in the evening:** This means limiting screens (phones, tablets, computers, TVs) before bed or using blue light filters.
* **Avoid eating before bed:** Give your digestive system a break before sleep.
* **Get your glucose under control:** A low-carb keto diet can be very helpful here.
* **Avoid TV before bed:** The light and stimulation can interfere with melatonin production.

**Best Practices for Buying Melatonin Supplements**

If you do decide to purchase a melatonin supplement for a specific condition, here are some best practices to ensure you're getting a quality product:

1. **Look for "Pharmaceutical Grade" or "USP Verified":** These designations indicate that the product meets strict quality, purity, and potency standards.
2. **Check the Dosage:** Melatonin dosages can range widely. Be sure the product offers the specific dosage you're looking for, especially if you're aiming for higher therapeutic amounts.
3. **Read the "Other Ingredients":** Opt for products with minimal fillers, artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives. Simpler is often better.
4. **Reputable Brand:** Choose well-known, transparent brands that are clear about their sourcing and manufacturing processes.
5. **Third-Party Testing:** Some brands will have their products tested by independent third-party labs to verify purity and accuracy of ingredients. This information is often available on their website or the product label.

## What brand of moringa powder does Dr. Berg recommend?

Dr. Berg does not have a brand to recommend; however, these are the best practices to follow when looking for a Morgina product.

1\. Source   •  Look for organic moringa grown in clean, uncontaminated soil.   •  The best moringa often comes from India, Sri Lanka, or parts of Africa, where the tree is native and traditionally cultivated.

2\. Non-GMO and Organic   •  Choose moringa that is certified organic and clearly labeled non-GMO. This ensures the leaves are free from genetically modified organisms and synthetic chemical residues.

3\. Color   •  A vibrant, deep green powder is a sign of freshness and high nutrient retention.   •  A pale or yellowish-green hue can signal poor drying practices, oxidation, or age.

4\. Dried at Low Temperatures   •  Look for shade-dried or low-temperature dried moringa. High-heat processing destroys delicate nutrients like enzymes and antioxidants.   •  Labels that mention “gently dried” or “raw” typically indicate better nutrient preservation.

5\. No Fillers or Additives   •  The ingredients list should say only one thing: “Moringa leaf powder.” No maltodextrin, rice flour, silica, or flow agents.

6\. Lab-Tested for Contaminants   •  Choose a brand that uses third-party testing to check for:   •  Heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic)   •  Pesticides and herbicides   •  Microbial contamination (mold, bacteria, pathogens)   •  Reputable companies will make lab results available or mention them clearly on the label or website.

7\. GMP-Certified Manufacturing   •  Look for products made in a GMP-certified facility (Good Manufacturing Practices). This ensures the powder was processed under strict hygiene and quality controls to avoid contamination and preserve potency.

8\. Freshness   •  Check for a harvest or packaging date when possible.   •  Choose small-batch brands with fast turnover. Older moringa loses flavor, color, and effectiveness.

9\. Packaging   •  High-quality moringa comes in opaque, airtight containers — like dark glass jars or sealed foil pouches — to protect against light and moisture.   •  Avoid clear plastic containers or any packaging that lets in light or air.

10\. Taste and Smell   •  It should smell fresh, earthy, and slightly bitter, like green tea or spinach. If it smells musty, sour, or bland, it’s likely old or poorly handled.

11\. Reputation and Reviews   •  Choose a brand with a strong reputation and transparent sourcing and processing practices.   •  Look for verified customer reviews, especially those mentioning improvements in energy, inflammation, or digestion.

## What brand of nattokinase does Dr. Berg recommend?

**Nattokinase: A Natural Enzyme for Cardiovascular Health**

While Dr. Berg doesn't provide a brand recommendation or suggested usage amount for **Nattokinase**, this powerful enzyme, extracted from the fermented soy product natto, offers significant health benefits. If you're considering taking it, always ensure it's **non-GMO**.

Nattokinase is renowned for its potent **blood clot-dissolving properties**. It works by dissolving **fibrin**, a key protein found in blood clots and arterial plaque, thereby improving circulation and potentially decreasing the risk of heart disease. It can also help to **lower blood pressure**.

## What brand of Vitamin E Tocotrienols does Dr. berg recommend?

When considering Vitamin E supplementation, it's important to understand the different forms and their unique benefits.

**Understanding Tocopherols vs. Tocotrienols**

Most people get sufficient **tocopherols** (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) through their diet, so supplementing with this form of Vitamin E isn't usually necessary. However, **tocotrienols** (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) are much harder to obtain from food sources and often where supplementation can be most beneficial.

A key difference lies in their antioxidant power: tocotrienols are significantly more potent at neutralizing free radicals—up to 50 times faster than tocopherols. Vitamin E, as a whole, is a powerful lipid antioxidant, crucial for protecting the **cell membranes** throughout your body. Without adequate Vitamin E, these membranes can suffer various types of damage. Think of tocotrienols as incredibly fast-spinning antioxidants, efficiently cleaning up and neutralizing free radical damage.

**Potential Benefits of Tocotrienols**

The benefits associated with Vitamin E, particularly the tocotrienol forms, are extensive:

* **Antioxidant Power:** They are highly effective at combating oxidative stress.
* **Anti-Cancer Properties:** Research suggests potential anti-cancer effects.
* **Cardioprotective:** They may help protect heart health.
* **Liver-Protective:** Tocotrienols can support liver function.
* **Cell Membrane Support:** They play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of cell membranes in your skin, brain, nervous system, and arteries.

**Natural Sources of Tocotrienols**

While harder to get, some dietary sources include:

* Rice (though not typically consumed on a keto diet)
* Palm oil
* Annatto (considered one of the best and most potent sources)

**Buying Vitamin E Tocotrienols**

If you decide to supplement with Vitamin E, here's what to look for:

* **Focus on Tocotrienols:** Since tocopherols are generally abundant in diet, prioritize supplements that feature **tocotrienols**.
* **Source Matters:** Look for tocotrienol supplements derived from **annatto**. Annatto is often favored because it primarily contains delta- and gamma-tocotrienols, which are considered particularly beneficial and potent. Other sources like palm or rice can also be good.
* **Check the Label for Specific Tocotrienols:** Ensure the product specifies which tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) and tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) are included. Ideally, you want a product rich in the **gamma and delta tocotrienol** forms.
* **"Full Spectrum" or "Mixed Tocotrienols":** Some products are labeled as "full spectrum" or "mixed tocotrienols," meaning they contain all four tocotrienol isomers. This can be beneficial for comprehensive support.
* **Avoid Isolated Alpha-Tocopherol:** Be cautious of supplements that primarily contain high doses of isolated alpha-tocopherol, as this can sometimes interfere with the absorption and benefits of other Vitamin E forms, including tocotrienols.
* **Quality and Purity:** As with any supplement, choose reputable brands that provide **third-party testing** for purity and potency. Look for certifications like GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice).
* **No Fillers:** Check the "Other Ingredients" list to ensure there are no unnecessary fillers, artificial colors, or preservatives.

While it can be beneficial to get the whole Vitamin E complex in supplement form (both tocopherols and tocotrienols), a common strategy is to ensure adequate tocopherol intake through diet and then specifically supplement with tocotrienols, ideally from a source like annatto.

## What can help boost low levels of collagen?

Copper is a vital trace mineral crucial for collagen production and elastin formation. It supports enzymatic processes that aid in protein synthesis, essential for maintaining skin elasticity and preventing collagen loss.

Beyond its role in skin health, copper facilitates iron transport, bolsters immunity, and may reduce excessive sweating. It also supports endurance during exercise, helps delay hair greying, improves balance, detoxifies fluoride, and promotes warmth in extremities. Rich dietary sources of copper include liver, kidney, oysters, shellfish, shiitake mushrooms, and sesame seeds. Incorporating these foods can ensure adequate copper intake for overall health benefits.

## What can help efficiently handle psoriasis?

With psoriasis, a person has an accelerated growth rate of certain skin cells. This can cause redness and dry flaking patches of skin. There is a high association between gut problems and psoriasis. There is also a high association between joint problems and psoriasis. It’s thought that people with psoriasis have a problem with a very important structure in the skin called GAG. NAG (n-acetyl glucosamine) is a precursor or building block for GAG. Some interesting data shows that NAG can improve psoriasis. It may also help with gut problems and joint problems. If you’re going to try this remedy, consider taking 1,000 to 2,000 mg over time.

## What can help me sleep better at night? (New video)

Cortisol should be at its lowest point at 2 a.m., but for some, it’s at its highest! This can cause night waking and other sleep problems that can really interfere with your day. Sleep medication can worsen this problem by causing your cortisol to rise even more. '

Magnesium glycinate before bed can help lower cortisol, which can help you sleep better at night. Twitching and cramping can signify a magnesium deficiency. Low blood sugar can increase cortisol and cause you to wake up at night. If your diet is high in carbs, your blood sugar may decrease while sleeping, and your body will increase cortisol levels to normalize your blood sugar.

If you’re waking up at 2 a.m., evaluate what you ate the day before. Refined starches, MSG, alcohol, snacking, and eating late can disturb sleep. Salt cravings can signify a sodium deficiency. Sodium helps lower cortisol, so add more sea salt to your meals throughout the day if you’re having salt cravings.

**Here are a few other sleep tips that can help you sleep better at night:**

•Avoid suspense and action movies before bed

•Avoid blue light before bed

•Get plenty of sunlight during the day

•Go for long walks

•Exercise to release excess energy The liver detoxifies the body between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m.

Night waking during this time frame could signify a problem with the liver. Milk thistle before bed can help. Restless legs syndrome can be related to a B1 or magnesium deficiency. Lower your carb intake and increase your consumption of these nutrients. A high pulse rate could signify a potassium deficiency, which can also interfere with sleep. Apple cider vinegar before bed can help stabilize blood sugar for better sleep, but make sure it’s diluted.

## What can help to relieve seasonal allergies?

Pollen is produced by flowers and is spread through the wind and by bees. If you have a pollen allergy, your body is rejecting pollen.

During this rejection process, your body goes through a series of immune reactions involving histamines. Histamines cause excess mucus production and fatigue. A good potential strategy is to gradually expose the body to pollen, starting with small amounts and increasing the amounts over time. This will cause the body to reject it less and less.

The best remedy for seasonal allergies to use as a part of this strategy is bee pollen. Local bee pollen contains a combination of many different types of pollen in your area.

**Bee pollen is also a powerful anti-inflammatory, has wound-healing effects, and is rich in:**

• Friendly microbes

• Amino acids

• Antioxidants

• Essential fatty acids

• Hormones

• Vitamins

• Minerals

You would want to start out with two to three grains of bee pollen per day and gradually increase the amount each day over at least one week. Eventually, you may want to try taking two to five teaspoons per day for an adult and one to two teaspoons per day for a child. You can chew the grains, grind them, or soak them in water and drink them.

It may be best to start this protocol in the winter before the spring. You could do this protocol two to three times per year. Other great natural remedies for allergies are quercetin, onions, or stinging nettle. It’s also important to support your liver if you’re experiencing allergies.

## What can I do for early puberty?

**It ultimately comes from exposure to Xenoestrogens which is external so your body isn’t making it because it's coming from the environment.**

Chemicals that mimic estrogen would be BPA(Plastic Bags), PCB(Industrial Waste), in the food supply, and more. The main one you should know about is ZERANOL (Potent Estrogen) which is a growth hormone that they inject into cattle. It’s actually banned in Europe but it is still used in the U.S. and is 100,000 times stronger than BPA. When you eat meats or dairy you should do organic, even though it might be a little more expensive you save more if you're doing intermittent fasting by eating a few times a day to invest in higher quality food.

## What can I do if I'm overthinking 24/7?

Overthinking can trigger cortisol, which equals more stress. Stress hormones will continue to stress you out, leaving you trapped in a vicious cycle of anxious thoughts that can be very difficult to break out of.

Most of the time, anxiety and overthinking can be fixed by addressing nutritional imbalances, but people are often prescribed SSRIs. These drugs block the reabsorption of serotonin and come with several side effects. They can downgrade the receptor for serotonin, which can cause a major deficiency in serotonin. Drugs, chronic stress, junk food, lack of sun, and vitamin D can deplete your serotonin and dopamine. Many people get the blues during the winter months because of a lack of vitamin D from the sun. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to anxiety and depression. Research has shown that vitamin D may produce the same results as a medication for depression without the side effects!

The health of your microbiome directly affects your mental health. The microbes that help increase serotonin are very sensitive to broad-spectrum antibiotics. To stop overthinking and improve your mental health, you’ll want to take at least 10,000 IU of vitamin D each day. You also need the microbes that make serotonin! L. reuteri affects serotonin more than any other microbe, yet over 96% of the population is deficient! The best way to fix this problem is to make your own probiotic yogurt using L. reuteri. This microbe can help decrease anxiety, increase oxytocin, and significantly reduce cortisol.

## What can I do to remedy excessive sweating?

It’s the overstimulation of the eccrine gland that really causes excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), and it’s typically triggered by stress.

Even though you might not feel stressed, your body may have a low threshold for stress and can respond to even the smallest things.

Some treatments for hyperhidrosis or excessive sweating are surgery or medications. But, we want to explore more natural alternatives for excessive sweating.

Natural remedies for excessive sweating:

1\. Rosmarinic acid (rosemary and sage)

2\. Vitamin B1 (thiamine)

## What can you do if you need to lower bad cholesterol naturally?

There is one specific food that can really help you. Your body makes cholesterol. Excess cholesterol is eliminated through the bile ducts with the help of bile salts. Bile salts have a lot of important roles in the body. Typically, carbohydrates will increase cholesterol and triglycerides. There are three types of carbohydrates: sugar, starches, and fiber. Fiber can actually help reduce your cholesterol, but it has to be the right type of fiber. We’re talking about the fiber in vegetables. Vegetables have low amounts of sugar and high amounts of fiber. They’re also rich in nutrients, phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Fiber helps bind with cholesterol and modify the absorption of lipids and fats. It also increases the production of bile and eliminates bile connected to cholesterol. Fiber has zero effect on blood sugar and insulin, which will help lower your cholesterol. Feeding your microbes fiber also decreases the production of cholesterol. If you have high cholesterol, consume more vegetables to help increase the release of bile and feed the microbes. At the same time, be sure to avoid sugar and starch in your diet.

## What common mistakes should be avoided when drinking water to ensure optimal hydration and health?

**Myth #1:** Once you feel thirsty, dehydration has already set in Truth: While feeling thirsty is a sign that your body needs more fluids, it does not necessarily mean you are dehydrated. Your body is designed to give you signals when you need more water, so just drink when you feel thirsty.

**Myth #2:** Drink water until your urine is clear Truth: Your urine should be a pale straw color or light yellow. If it's too clear, it means you are overhydrated; if it is too dark, it could indicate a potential health issue with your liver or kidneys.

**Myth #3:** Drink water to feel full and reduce food intake Truth: While replacing sugary drinks with water can help you lose weight, drinking more water does not directly lead to fat loss.

**Myth #4:** Drinking more water will flush out toxins Truth: Most toxins are fat-soluble and are not flushed out by drinking water alone. The body has its own detoxification system, so just focus on staying hydrated instead of trying to "detox" with excessive water intake.

**Myth #5:** Water will prevent dehydration Truth: While it is true that hydration is vital for overall health, simply drinking water will not prevent dehydration. Other factors, such as electrolytes play an important role in preventing dehydration.

**Myth #6:** Drink more water Truth: Drinking massive amounts of water can lead to imbalances in the body. Certain situations will call for more water intake—just don't overdo it. If you're prone to kidney stones, you need at least 2.5 liters of fluid per day

**Myth #7:** Drink water right before you eat Truth: Drinking water before meals is fine, but it may cause discomfort for individuals who experience heartburn or bloating.

**A few more key points to remember:**

• If you're prone to kidney stones, consider adding lemon to your water.

• Add a little bit of baking soda to your water if you experience gout symptoms.

• The keto flu or fatigue experienced by some individuals on a keto diet is often due to not consuming enough electrolytes with their water, specifically salt.

• Proper hydration is vital for kidney health, but drinking more water won't cleanse or "flush out" the kidneys.

## What constitutes the complex framework of an antioxidant network, and how do its components interact to neutralize oxidative stress?

A free radical is an atom with an unpaired electron and could create a lot of damage inside the body. While an antioxidant is an atom that has a paired electron, it's stable and balanced and it also donates one of its electrons to make the free radical stable.

**Examples of Free Radicals and Oxidants:**

• Iron – In some of the enriched food

• Radiation

• Sugar – Large quantities of sugar destroy the body

• Chemicals / Pollution / Smoking

• Vegetable Oils – It can act as an oxidant and create free radicals

**Antioxidants:**

• Vitamin E

• Vitamin C

• Zinc – Oysters, Seafood, Lobster

• Selenium – Brazil nuts

• Vitamin B1 – Leafy Greens

• Lipoic acid – it’s a fat-soluble and has the ability to penetrate into the cell and protect the cells at different locations

• Uric acid – help clean out damage from various things

## What dietary choices are most effective in supporting the reduction of an enlarged prostate?

**Prostate Health: Understanding Enlargement and Natural Solutions**

The prostate, a walnut-sized gland located below the bladder, can become enlarged with age. This condition, known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, can cause urinary problems and sometimes increases the risk of prostate cancer.

One common cause of prostate enlargement is the conversion of testosterone to a more potent form called DHT (dihydrotestosterone). Medications exist to block this conversion, but they carry potential side effects like decreased libido, increased prostate cancer risk, and withdrawal symptoms.

**Natural Support: Lycopene and Beyond**

A natural solution lies in lycopene, a potent antioxidant found in tomatoes (especially cooked or processed tomatoes like sauce or paste). Lycopene may inhibit the enzyme that creates DHT, potentially reducing prostate enlargement and cancer risk. For the best absorption, consume tomatoes with healthy fats like olive oil.

Additional prostate-friendly nutrients include zinc and resveratrol. Conversely, avoiding milk may be beneficial for prostate health.

**Take Action**

Consider adding tomatoes to your diet twice a week, either fresh, cooked from scratch, or via quality tomato products. Growing your own or sourcing locally from a farmer's market is ideal.

**Important Note:** While natural remedies can be helpful, always consult with your doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment of prostate issues.

## What foods are most effective for supporting the body's healing and repair processes, and how do their nutrients aid recovery?

Other types of protein, like eggs and salmon, are beneficial—but red meat is the best to support healing. Of all the things needed for the repair or healing process, amino acids are among the most important.

**Red meat is more bioavailable and is a more concentrated source of amino acids than other types of protein. It also contains more iron, magnesium, zinc, B vitamins, vitamin K, and omega-3 fatty acids than eggs.**

This doesn’t include processed meat from factory farms. It’s crucial to get high-quality grass-fed, grass-finished red meat.

**Red meat also contains four important additional nutrients for healing, repair, and recovery:**

1\. Carnitine

2\. Creatine

3\. Carnosine

4\. Coenzyme Q10

**People who have difficulty digesting red meat typically have low stomach acid. Even if you don’t like the taste of red meat, it may be because you have low stomach acid. Betaine hydrochloride may be beneficial to help strengthen your stomach acid. You can try taking three to five betaine hydrochloride supplements before a meal for about one month. However, if you tend to have excess iron, red meat may not be for you. Instead, you could try consuming more poultry or eggs.**

***

## What foods can help to reverse kidney damage?

Potassium protects kidney health in several ways. It helps lower high blood pressure, which damages the kidneys and protects against kidney stones. Too much sodium can be hard on the kidneys, but the remedy is more potassium.

A proper diet with adequate vitamin D, potassium, and magnesium can significantly improve kidney health.

The following foods protect the kidneys from damage and support kidney health:

1\. Vegetables: asparagus, celery, bell peppers, cabbage, cauliflower, garlic

2\. Magnesium-rich foods: pumpkin seeds, leafy greens, avocadoes, magnesium glycinate

3\. Probiotic-foods: kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi

4\. Moderate amounts of high-quality protein

5\. High-antioxidant foods: strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, beets

6\. Quercetin: onions

7\. Extra virgin olive oil

Consuming tea is a great way to stay hydrated and support kidney health. Polyphenols found in tea are very beneficial for the kidney. Green, nettle, dandelion, turmeric, and decaffeinated black tea are all great options. Frequent eating can overtax the kidneys' filtration system. A low-carb diet and intermittent fasting are very beneficial for kidney health. Intermittent fasting can decrease the stress on the kidneys and significantly reduce insulin. Too much insulin can be damaging to the kidneys.

## What foods should be incorporated into the diet to effectively lower cholesterol levels, and how do their specific nutrients contribute to heart health and improved lipid profiles?

However, keep in mind that if you have a genetic problem called familial hypercholesterolemia or if you are a hyper responder, this information will not apply.

**Health benefits of cholesterol:**

• It helps make hormones

• It helps make vitamin D

• It supports cell membranes

• It supports the brain

• It supports the immune system

• It’s needed to make bile salts

Egg yolks are one of the highest sources of cholesterol-mobilizing nutrients: choline and lecithin. One egg gives you about 186 mg of cholesterol. But, the body makes about 3000 mg of cholesterol a day. Dietary cholesterol isn’t associated with increased cholesterol. There are also no studies that show that consuming eggs negatively affects the cardiovascular system. In one study, they found that certain phytonutrients in eggs improved the cholesterol profile in a group of people on a low-carb diet. Egg yolks are also loaded with vitamin K2, which supports a healthy heart.

Grass-fed butter also has an incredible influence over cholesterol, and if you can find cultured butter, then that’s even better. Cultured butter has the added benefit of friendly bacteria that help boost the benefits of butter.

Your friendly microbes make bile salts, which help mobilize and regulate cholesterol. Butter is also a good source of vitamin K2 and is great for anyone going through menopause because cholesterol is needed to support hormones. One study shows that butter has a neutral association with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Beta-carotene, which is high in butter, may also help lower cholesterol. Butter is also rich in CLA, butyric acid, and omega-3 fatty acids, which may benefit healthy cholesterol.

## What health benefits are associated with omega-3 fatty acids, and how do they contribute to overall well-being?

### **The Essential Role of Omega-3s in Brain Health**

[Omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/basics-of-omega-3-fatty-acids), particularly DHA and EPA, are like the VIP nutrients for your brain. Omega-3s aren't merely beneficial but indispensable for nurturing and enhancing mental faculties like recollection, concentration, and emotional balance.

#### **Understanding DHA's Impact on Cognitive Functions**

DHA acts as a cornerstone in brain health. It forms the building blocks of the brain itself, influencing how well we remember things, our ability to concentrate, and even our emotional stability.

[Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4404917/) show that adequate levels of DHA can improve learning abilities, suggesting its significance cannot be overstated.

This fat isn't just sitting there; it's actively involved in creating cell membranes around neurons—think of it as insulation on wires that helps signals travel faster and more efficiently across your brain.

#### **The Functional Benefits of EPA on the Brain**

EPA supports cognitive health from another angle—it plays a crucial role beyond structure by fostering an environment conducive to mental functioning.

While less direct than DHA’s structural benefits, research highlights the EPA’s importance in modulating mood disorders, which can indirectly impact cognitive function through improved mental well-being.

## What helps to stop cold at first sign?

First, take zinc and vitamin C together, but eat foods high in vitamin C as opposed to a supplement. I recommend eating lemons, as opposed to pasteurized lemon juice.

You can also drink apple cider vinegar because when you acidify your body with it, you speed up the action of white blood cells called phagocytes. They clean up bacteria as part of your immune system.

Eat garlic. It’s the most powerful anti-viral food I know. It’s also anti-bacterial. Make sure you do these things right when you get the first symptom of a cold.

## What indicators or symptoms should I be aware of that might suggest a deficiency in Vitamin D levels?

Professor Bruce Hollis' groundbreaking research has revolutionized our understanding of vitamin D's crucial role and multifaceted functions.

Historically, vitamin D was primarily associated with maintaining bone health and calcium levels. However, advancements in research have revealed its impact on a broader range of cells, including cancer and immune cells.

Vitamin D undergoes transformations within the body. It starts as an inactive form, obtained through supplements or sunlight exposure. This inactive form is then converted into 25-hydroxy vitamin D, an intermediate form circulating in the bloodstream for weeks. While this form is measurable in blood tests, it remains largely inaccessible to tissues that require it.

The final and most potent form of vitamin D is 125 di-hydroxy vitamin D, a powerful hormone. This conversion predominantly occurs in the kidneys but can also happen within individual cells.

Unfortunately, much of the existing research on vitamin D in the U.S. is flawed, leading to inaccurate conclusions. There's also a lack of consensus on "normal" vitamin D levels and what constitutes a deficiency.

Professor Hollis' research has yielded remarkable results, demonstrating vitamin D's effectiveness in preventing birth complications in Iranian women, benefiting patients with low-grade prostate cancer, and supporting lactation. He also emphasizes the importance of magnesium as a vital cofactor in vitamin D metabolism.

Professor Hollis aims to raise awareness about vitamin D's underappreciated benefits, highlighting that many physicians remain uninformed due to a lack of recognition and understanding from national organizations.

## What interventions are effective in alleviating sleep disturbances associated with elevated cortisol levels?

What is cortisol? Cortisol is a stress hormone that has a lot of different functions with the immune system for countering stress. It’s a survival hormone.

\*High cortisol can definitely interfere with restful sleep.

Between about 12am and 2am, you should have the lowest amount of cortisol. The highest level of cortisol is between 6am and 9 am. But, in some cases, cortisol can get higher during the night and counter deep sleep. You might be sleeping, but you’re not getting deep sleep or restful sleep.

There can be a problem with different parts of the brain that are activated and then prevent you from getting restful sleep, all because your cortisol will not turn off. The goal is not to keep cortisol at zero but to help normalize cortisol, so you don’t have anything interfering with your sleep cycles. But, you still need to have the function of cortisol, which is vital.

**What to do about high cortisol:**

• Figure out what’s causing you stress and do what you can to handle it

• Go for long walks (45-60 minutes every day outside and disconnected)

• Try my do it yourself acupressure technique

**What you can take to reduce stress:**

• L-tyrosine

• L-theanine

• Calcium

• Magnesium

• Potassium

• Zinc

• GABA

• Ashwagandha

• Magnolia

• NAC

• Vitamin C

• Vitamin B1

## What interventions can quickly relieve abdominal gas and bloating, and how do they address the underlying causes?

Struggling with abdominal gas and bloating? You're not alone! This common issue affects countless individuals, causing discomfort and frustration. But don't worry, there are solutions.

**What Causes Gas and Bloating?**

Before jumping to conclusions like irritable bowel syndrome or celiac disease, consider these four potential culprits:

1. **SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth):** An excess of bacteria in the small intestine leads to gas production (hydrogen and methane), causing bloating, constipation, and abdominal pain. A hydrogen methane breath test can diagnose SIBO.
2. **Too Many Methanogens:** These microbes produce hydrogen and methane gas, consuming starches and sugars. An imbalance can cause bloating and constipation.
3. **Low Stomach Acid:** Insufficient stomach acid hinders protein digestion, leading to gas and bloating. It can also contribute to SIBO development.
4. **Decreased Bile:** Bile, produced by the liver, is essential for fat digestion. Insufficient bile can cause gas, bloating, and pain on the right side of the body.

**What to Do About It:**

1. **Lower Carbs and Fiber:** Reduce your intake of carbohydrates and fiber, especially for a month if your symptoms are severe. Opt for cooked vegetables over raw and avoid synthetic carbohydrates and fibers. Intermittent fasting can also help clear your system.
2. **Add Betaine HCL:** This natural amino acid compound increases hydrochloric acid, aiding protein digestion, mineral absorption, and microbe elimination. Take supplements before meals, avoiding calcium at the same time.
3. **Avoid Dairy:** If you're lactose intolerant or sensitive to casein, eliminate dairy products from your diet.
4. **Add Bile Salts:** If you experience pain on your right side, try purified bile salts after meals. Combine with betaine hydrochloride before meals for optimal digestion.

**Conclusion:**

By understanding these potential causes and following the recommended solutions, you can overcome gas, bloating, and related digestive issues. Remember, consult your doctor for personalized advice and diagnosis.

## What is a good option for a high-dose potassium supplement, and what should be considered when choosing one for effectiveness and safety?

Of course, I'm not biased of my own electrolyte powder, but I think it's pretty high quality. You should try that one.

But it's high potassium, it was a thousand milligrams. You know, you try to buy a potassium supplement, it only comes in 99 milligrams. I mean, why is that per dose? Is it like you'd have to have the whole bottle.

Our bodies need 4,700 per day and that's, it could be more than that, especially if you're adding more salt to your diet. So I think it's an interesting experiment on your body to just see what you would feel like if you actually got 4,700 milligrams of potassium, because potassium is necessary for the sodium-potassium pump that pumps all the nerves in your muscles and your body. So without that, you're gonna be tired.

And this is probably why when people do the electrolyte powders with the potassium, they can go along with exercise as well, because they have more energy.

## What is an effective remedy for twitching and frequent blinking?

Involuntary muscle movements like twitching and frequent blinking can stem from conditions such as Tourette's syndrome, Tardive Dyskinesia, Dystonia, or side effects from certain medications. Damage to the extrapyramidal part of the brain, which regulates these movements, can also be a factor.

Research suggests that sufficient manganese intake, around 10mg three times daily, may help improve these symptoms by supporting the function of the extrapyramidal system. When taking manganese supplements, it's advisable to also supplement with magnesium and vitamin B3 (niacin) for optimal efficacy.

## What is Benfotiamine?

**Benfotiamine:**

1. **Fat-Soluble**: Benfotiamine is a fat-soluble form of Vitamin B1, which allows it to be absorbed more efficiently and penetrate cells and tissues more effectively than water-soluble Thiamine.
2. **Nerve Health Support:** This nutrient supports nerve health and helps maintain the normal structure and function of the myelin sheath (the insulation around nerve axons). It also supports the body's natural processes for managing advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and maintaining a healthy inflammatory response. This contributes to:
3. Supporting overall nerve function and comfort.
4. Promoting a healthy nervous system environment
5. **Supports Thiamine-Dependent Pathways:** As a lipid-soluble form of Vitamin B1, Benfotiamine helps maintain healthy thiamine levels. Thiamine is crucial for normal carbohydrate metabolism and plays an important role in supporting healthy nerve tissue and cardiovascular function.

***

## What is berberine?

Berberine is a natural chemical in certain plants. Berberine is most known for helping to support healthy blood sugar levels and making insulin more sensitive. Berberine attacks insulin resistance, which is at the heart of most health problems like a fatty liver, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, and high LDL cholesterol. Anything that helps decrease insulin resistance will also help support weight loss.

***

## What is Betaine HCL, and what are its benefits for digestive health and overall well-being?

**Betaine hydrochloride is an amino acid.** It’s found naturally in certain foods including beets, spinach, beef, and shrimp. Betaine hydrochloride is an important natural remedy if you have SIBO (small intestine bacterial overgrowth), because one of the functions of a strong acid is to prevent pathogens from moving from the stomach into your small intestine then multiplying out of control. **Betaine hydrochloride is meant to increase your stomach acid; in other words, to lower your pH.** Your stomach acid should be between 1.5 and 3, which is highly acidic. This will help with the absorption of vitamin B12, minerals, trace minerals, and protein. It activates protease, an enzyme that helps break down protein into amino acids. If your body can’t properly break down protein, it’s left partially undigested, which creates a big problem.

**The remedy of betaine hydrochloride is excellent for GERD and acid reflux.** **Be sure to not take calcium at the same time as betaine hydrochloride, because the calcium will neutralize the acid. I recommend taking betaine hydrochloride before each meal. You may need as much as 5 or 6 tablets before you start eating. It may take some time for it to help your body make more acid. Antibiotics and antacids tend to destroy your stomach acid, making you more dependent on these medications. Take betaine hydrochloride to help.**

• Helps build muscle/ increases muscle mass

• Increases muscle strength

• Increases endurance

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-is-creatine-drberg)

***

## What is creatine, and how does taking it affect energy and muscle performance?

Creatine is a combination of three amino acids. These amino acids are arginine, glycine, and methionine. In your muscles, it combines with phosphate to help you recycle ATP (the energy currency in the muscles). It helps you recover the energy.

**Benefits of creatine:**

• It can help you tolerate heavy weight training

• It can help with the recovery of the muscle

• It can help the strength of the muscle

• It can help the size of the muscle

There are different types of creatine. Some people can actually be allergic to creatine as well. You may want to have a small amount first, to make sure you’re not allergic to it.

**There are two versions of creatine that I think are better than others:**

• Creatine ethyl ester

• Micronized creatine

## What is Dr. Berg's perspective on the potential use of castor oil as a natural remedy for treating cataracts?

While castor oil is beneficial for promoting eyelash growth and has various uses, I recommend N-acetylcarnosine (NAC) drops for treating cataracts. NAC drops are effective because they penetrate the eye and act as a powerful antioxidant, addressing the underlying cause of cataracts—glycation. Glycation involves the binding of proteins to sugar molecules, leading to opacity in the lens. Therefore, NAC drops are more suitable than castor oil for cataract treatment.

## What is Dr. Berg's perspective on using diatomaceous earth as a remedy for parasites, and what are the potential benefits and risks associated with its use?

It's a very good remedy for parasites. These parasites are exposed to this thing and it literally cuts their internally. It just destroys them from the inside out. But parasites, we all have them to a certain degree. It's just a matter of keeping our defenses against them. And so the best thing is to take a good probiotic or eat foods that are filled with probiotics like the sauerkraut, the kimchi, kefir, those types of things. But there's other remedies too.

**The black walnut hull extract garlic,** a really good remedy for parasites. But there's many different plant-based herbs that are anti-parasitic. But build up your gut and then also good stomach acid by maybe taking the supplement.

**Betaine hydrochloride** is another really good thing to make sure you don't have any parasites that slip through the barrier of the stomach acid when you eat foods.

## What is glucagon and what is its role in the body?

The pancreas has two cells: Beta cells, which make insulin, and Alpha cells, which make another hormone called glucagon.

Glucagon opposes insulin, which means insulin lowers blood sugar, and glucagon raises it by breaking down glycogen, stored sugar in the liver. Glucagon also makes new glucose if needed, and that process is called gluconeogenesis.

Ways Glucagon Raises Blood Sugar:

1\. Breaks down glycogen

2\. Makes new glucose (gluconeogenesis)

3\. Activates fat release

4\. Inhibits fat storage

5\. Increases bile release

What Triggers Glucagon:

1\. Lower blood glucose or lower insulin

2\. Amino Acids (Moderate amount)

3\. Exercise – The more exhaustive it is, the more triggering, up to 4 to 5x.

***

## What is glutathione and how can I make sure I get enough amount of it without taking supplements?

**Glutathione is an important antioxidant present in all of your cells. It helps detoxify heavy metals and protects against free radical damage and oxidation. Your body makes glutathione! You should only take a supplement if you have Tylenol poisoning. Tylenol depletes glutathione and puts your liver at risk for damage. If you’re dealing with Tylenol poisoning, you may be given an NAC supplement, a precursor to help build up your glutathione.**

**Try the following tips to ensure that you’re getting enough glutathione without taking a supplement:**

1\. Get enough glycine. Consume organ meats, the skin from meat and fish, bone broth, and gelatin.

2\. Ensure adequate B vitamin intake. Avoid synthetic B vitamins. Meat is a great source of B12 and consuming organ meats and dark leafy greens will help add folate to your diet.

3\. Get plenty of vitamin C from sources like sauerkraut and leafy greens.

4\. Get enough sleep.

5\. Do not over-exercise. Limit high-intensity exercise to twice a week.

6\. Reduce stress. Adaptogens, going for a walk, listening to music, and even physical labor can reduce stress.

7\. Consume sufficient protein with plenty of calories.

8\. Increase carb intake to 50 grams per day.

9\. Consume cruciferous vegetables.

10\. Consume seafood for trace minerals like zinc and selenium.

## What is glycine, and what are its essential roles and significance in physiological processes, including metabolic functions, neurotransmission, and tissue repair?

**Glycine, beyond its crucial role in collagen production, supports various body functions contributing to overall health and disease prevention.**

**Antioxidant Production and Inflammation Reduction**

Glycine is essential for producing glutathione, the body's primary antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative stress and inflammation. By supporting glutathione synthesis, glycine enhances the body's defenses against chronic diseases.

**Enhancing Sleep Quality**

Glycine improves sleep quality by promoting deeper, more restful sleep. Studies indicate that taking glycine before bed can help individuals fall asleep faster and achieve more restorative slow-wave sleep, crucial for repair, hormone balance, and cognitive function.

**Detoxification and Uric Acid Management**

Glycine aids liver detoxification processes, helping eliminate toxins and excess uric acid. This detoxification role may prevent conditions such as gout and kidney stones, illustrating glycine's impact on overall health.

**Regulating Blood Sugar Levels**

Glycine enhances insulin effectiveness and stabilizes blood sugar levels, essential for individuals with type 2 diabetes or those at risk. By supporting healthy insulin function, glycine may prevent diabetes and aid in weight management by reducing cravings and promoting satiety.

***

## What is glycine, and what are its key roles and benefits in the body, particularly for health, metabolism, and overall well-being?

**It's a very important amino acid: glycine.** Collagen is a main component of connective tissues, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage. About ⅓ of collagen is made by glycine. Your body can make glycine, but unfortunately, it doesn’t make very much. If you're not getting it from the diet, you could be deficient. Unless you’re eating the skin and cartilage from meat, you’re probably not getting enough glycine.

**Glycine** is needed to make the most important antioxidant for all of your cells, glutathione. Without enough glycine to make glutathione, you can’t detoxify your body. This can cause a buildup of toxicity, leading to inflammation. Glycine is a potent anti-inflammatory agent and is an essential building block for many enzymes and proteins.

**Here are some of the many important functions of glycine:**

• Makes heme in your blood

• Important for gum health

• Essential for DNA

• Building block for catalase

• Supports sleep

• Supports the liver

• Can help fix a leaky gut

• Detoxifies uric acid

• Supports blood sugar

• Helps with weight loss

• Reduces visceral fat

**Glycine can also turn into glucose to be used as fuel.** Certain parts of the body, especially the brain, need a certain amount of glucose. If you’re not consuming glucose, your body can make it. Glycine is a precursor for glucose, but don’t worry about it bumping you out of ketosis. Glycine stimulates the hormone glucagon, which opposes insulin.

**If you’re not eating animals nose-to-tail, if you’re under stress, taking medication, drinking alcohol, or exposed to toxins, you can become deficient in glycine.** You can increase your glycine intake by consuming gelatin! Try making your own gelatin using Knox Blox and using a natural sweetener like stevia. You can also take a glycine supplement. The average person needs about 4 to 10 grams of glycine per day.

**Bone broth and pork rinds can increase your glycine intake, but you need to consume a lot to get enough glycine.**

As we age, we need more glycine. Increasing glycine intake can potentially help people with osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, hair thinning, insomnia, gout, and kidney stones.

## What is Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and how does it relate to overall cardiovascular health and autonomic nervous system function?

**HRV is a measurement of the variations between the heartbeats. There are different time distances between your heartbeats. The more varied the timing is between the heartbeats, the healthier a person is, and the higher the HRV is. The less varied the timing is, the less healthy the person is, and the lower the HRV is.**

**HRV measures the autonomic nervous system.** It has been well-researched and can help a person understand their ability to adapt to and recover from stress.

Many people use this technology to determine whether or not their body can handle the stress of working out on a given day. Maybe they can handle doing high-intensity training one day, but their body would do better with a day off or with low-impact exercise the next. There are many different lifestyle changes you can make to help improve your overall health. HRV technology can help give you feedback to see if what you’re doing is actually benefiting you. It can even tell you your biological age and rate of aging.

You really can’t take your health to the next level if you can’t measure it. This is a fantastic and easy-to-use tool to help you do that right at home.

## What is L. reuteri?

Rats given L. reuteri stayed young, active, and slender, and their fur remained thick and healthy as they aged. Their immune systems were amplified, and wound healing time was cut in half. Increased testosterone and growth hormone were observed in elderly mice, and the thymus was restored to its original size. Dr. Davis has seen all of these amazing benefits in humans! Many people are missing this microbe! L. reuteri, like other Lactobacillus species, are very susceptible to antibiotics. Dr. Davis estimates that 96% of the population is missing L. reuteri, a major factor in the SIBO epidemic.

L. reuteri is a keystone microbe, which is important for the entire body’s ecosystem. It’s been found to increase the hormone oxytocin, traditionally regarded as the hormone of love and empathy. Oxytocin also influences body composition.

Many people experience increased muscle mass after consuming L. reuteri, which can be very beneficial in combating age-related muscle loss and many other side effects of aging. You can make your own L. reuteri “yogurt” for its amazing benefits! This description contains affiliate links, which pay commissions at no extra cost to you.

## What is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and what are its essential functions in cellular metabolism, energy production, and overall health?

Discover the secrets to youthful longevity and vitality by unlocking the power of your body's energy factories - the mitochondria. Their health directly influences how you age, and a key player in their function is NAD, a vital nutrient involved in energy production.

NAD not only helps prevent muscle loss, especially in cancer patients, but also shields against radiation damage. However, NAD levels naturally decline as we age. Fortunately, research has shown that certain compounds can boost NAD and slow down the aging process.

Here are 5 compounds that can naturally increase NAD levels and promote a longer, healthier life:

1. **Apigenin:** Found in parsley, thyme, oregano, basil, and celery.
2. **Anthoxanthin:** Enjoy blueberries, elderberries, concord grapes, purple potatoes, and other colorful blue, purple, or red foods.
3. **Curcumin:** The active compound in turmeric.
4. **Quercetin:** Abundant in onions (especially the outer layers) and apple skin.
5. **Methylene blue:** This historical drug can effectively boost NAD levels.

By incorporating these NAD-boosting compounds into your diet, you can support mitochondrial health, slow down aging, and enjoy a more vibrant and youthful life.

## What is one ingredient that can help shrink an enlarged prostate?

The prostate gland wraps around a small tube underneath the bladder and is usually the size of a walnut. When a prostate is enlarged, it can interfere with urine flow and can sometimes turn cancerous. An enlarged prostate is also called benign prostatic hyperplasia. Testosterone is said to cause prostate enlargement. With the help of an enzyme, testosterone is converted into DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a more potent form of testosterone. One of the best-selling drugs for prostate enlargement works by inhibiting this enzyme.

Testosterone and DHT decrease as we age, but the enzyme that makes DHT increases.

There is a natural inhibitor of this enzyme, called lycopene, that may decrease the risk of prostate enlargement by 21%. It may also reduce the risk of prostate cancer and decrease inflammation. It even has potent antioxidant effects.

Lycopene is a carotenoid found in watermelon, carrots, and grapefruit, but tomatoes are the best source.

Try growing your own tomatoes or getting them from the farmer’s market. You can also consume canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, or tomato paste because the lycopene in tomatoes becomes more bioavailable when heated. Make sure you choose tomato sauce without sugar! Lycopene is a fat-soluble compound, so add olive oil when cooking with tomatoes to help extract it.

Try adding tomatoes to your diet twice a week to help shrink an enlarged prostate.

Zinc and resveratrol are also helpful enlarged prostate remedies. Milk is one of the worst things for an enlarged prostate!

## What is one of the best remedies to increase testosterone?

One of the best natural remedies to increase testosterone: onions. Testosterone does a lot in the body, including increasing libido, controlling male characteristics, and increasing muscle growth. When someone takes testosterone, they inactivate the gland that makes the hormone. Generally, we want to choose natural ways to increase testosterone, which can involve natural glandular therapy. Onions are high in quercetin, which triggers the luteinizing hormone. Luteinizing hormone controls and can increase the production of testosterone in males.

## What is serrapeptase, and what are its mechanisms of action, therapeutic applications, and potential benefits in the context of inflammation and pain management?

Serrapeptase is a powerful proteolytic enzyme found initially in the intestines of silkworms but is now produced through fermentation. Here are some critical points about serrapeptase based on Dr. Berg's recommendations:

* **Protein-Dissolving Enzyme**: Serrapeptase is known for its ability to break down non-living tissues within the body, such as scar tissue, clots in the arteries, and fibrous tissue. This makes it beneficial for managing conditions like fibrosis and improving blood flow.
* **Anti-Inflammatory Properties**: It supports healthy inflammation responses, which can be crucial for tackling various health issues, including fatty liver disease and fluid retention in feet and ankles.
* **Liver Health**: Serrapeptase helps dissolve scar tissue in the liver, which can benefit individuals with cirrhosis or other liver conditions. Promoting better organ functionality indirectly supports healthier hormone regulation processes.
* **Usage**: Serrapeptase should be taken on an empty stomach or between meals for optimal absorption. This ensures that it enters the bloodstream and targets the intended areas rather than digesting food.
* **Supplement Form**: It is available in supplement form, and it's essential to choose a high-quality product, ideally with at least 250,000 IU (about 450 mg) for effectiveness.

Serrapeptase can be a valuable addition to your health regimen, especially for addressing issues related to scar tissue, inflammation, and liver health. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.

## What is the 30-Day Sugar Detox program, and how does it help reduce sugar intake and improve health?

What will happen if you cut sugar out of your diet for thirty days? Let’s talk about it.

Metabolic flexibility is a term used to describe how smoothly and efficiently your cells can adapt to utilize and burn fuel like fat, ketones, or glucose.

When you’re metabolically inflexible, this transition is very dysfunctional. Your ability to burn fat in a fasting state will be very difficult. If you can’t lose weight when fasting or exercising, this could be why.

Metabolic inflexibility can lead to diabetes, obesity, loss of muscle protein, and chronic illnesses. It can also cause irritability, fatigue, anxiety, and hunger. When you try to fast, you won’t feel very good, and you’ll miss out on certain benefits if you’re not metabolically flexible.

Insulin resistance is at the heart of this problem. Insulin controls whether you burn fat or not. If someone is metabolically inflexible, they have insulin resistance. Insulin tells the body not to burn fat and to store fat instead.

On the flip side, metabolic flexibility is really insulin sensitivity, and there are ways to make the body more metabolically flexible or insulin sensitive.

When you become more metabolically flexible, you’ll be able to fast for longer without hunger or cravings, burn fat, and burn sugar more efficiently.

How to transition your body into a state of metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity:

1\. Eat less frequently

2\. Eat fewer carbohydrates

3\. Eat sufficient amounts of fat, but not excessive amounts of fat

4\. Try exercise snacking (do short bouts of exercise throughout the day)

## What is the best adrenal glands support?

The purpose of the adrenal glands is to adapt your body to physical and mental stress. Out of all of the vitamins and minerals, the adrenal gland has the highest concentration of vitamin C. Vitamin C is crucial to the healthy function of the adrenal cortex and medulla.

Vitamin C is a co-factor or helper nutrient for catecholamines—which are the neurotransmitters inside the adrenals (like serotonin, dopamine, and adrenaline).

Vitamin C is also a co-factor for the steroid hormones outside of the gland (like cortisol, aldosterone, and androgens). Additionally, vitamin C acts as an antioxidant in the adrenal glands.

## What is the best dietary approach for individuals with a genetic marker for breast cancer, and what specific foods can help reduce risk and support overall health?

If you have a genetic marker for breast cancer, consuming cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, sprouts, and cabbage is highly beneficial. These vegetables contain sulforaphane, a potent phytonutrient that inhibits aromatase, an enzyme responsible for converting testosterone into estrogen. This can help reduce estrogen levels and balance stronger estrogens into weaker, more protective ones. Additionally, cruciferous vegetables stimulate genes that detoxify cancer-causing agents. If you find it challenging to consume these vegetables, sprouts offer a concentrated source of the same benefits.

## What is the best natural remedy for an ulcer?

The best natural remedy for an ulcer is cabbage due to its unique sulfur-based compound that specifically targets H. pylori, the microbe responsible for many ulcers. This compound effectively eliminates the pathogenic H. pylori without harming beneficial bacteria. Cabbage can be consumed as juice or steamed, retaining up to 97% of the beneficial compound. Fermented cabbage, such as sauerkraut, also offers benefits, although slightly less potent, but includes additional probiotics. Avoid apple cider vinegar, as it may exacerbate the ulcer.

## What is the best nutritional source of B12?

**There are three primary sources of B12 for vegans.**

1\. Nori (red algae)

2\. Chlorella

3\. Spirulina

There are two types of B12. There’s a pseudo B12 (B12 analog) and real B12. B12 analog is similar in chemistry to B12, but not similar in function. So if an algae has large amounts of pseudo B12, it can block real B12. In turn, this can cause a serious deficiency.

Unless you’re taking B12 supplements, I do not recommend that you try to get all of your dietary B12 from nori or spirulina. However, chlorella does contain a significant amount of real B12. This is the best source of vitamin B12 for vegans. You need about 6 tablets or one teaspoon of chlorella twice per day.

## What is the best remedy for varicose veins?

Veins only pump blood when there is muscle movement. So, a sedentary person may have more problems with their veins.

Any obstruction in your liver, like scar tissue or fat, can also cause a problem with your veins. This obstruction can not only lead to varicose veins but also affect the veins in your esophagus and the lining of your stomach.

High estrogen can also affect the vascular system and can lead to varicose veins in women and men. We really want to focus on the issues with the lower legs, where the vein circulation isn’t moving. This is called chronic venous insufficiency.

Along with red vine leaf extract, you may want to try doing more rebound exercises and walking regularly—stay active. If you have a liver problem, an excellent natural remedy is TUDCA. If you have a problem with excess estrogen, you may want to try DIM.

## What is the best supplement for swollen legs?

Swollen legs, commonly associated with edema, are often attributed to liver, kidney, or heart issues. However, there's a chance you can address edema and pitting edema without resorting to blood thinners or diuretics.

The root of water retention in the lower legs lies in the sodium-potassium pumps within your cells. If these pumps malfunction, fluid builds up outside the cells, causing interstitial fluid retention.

High blood sugar can lead to swollen ankles due to glycation, a process that hampers the blood's ability to transport oxygen and nutrients. Glycated proteins also obstruct circulation, further contributing to swelling in the legs and ankles. Additionally, high blood sugar promotes sodium retention, which exacerbates water retention and can even result in peripheral neuropathy, causing numbness and tingling in the feet.

To combat edema, prioritize potassium intake, which is challenging to obtain solely through diet. Aim for 4700 mg daily, incorporating foods like avocados and berries. Magnesium is also vital; strive for 420 mg daily through sources like pumpkin seeds and leafy greens. A quality electrolyte powder without added sugars can supplement your intake.

Vitamin B1 deficiency is often linked to sodium-potassium pump issues, as it's essential for converting sugar into energy. Excessive refined carbohydrate consumption can deplete Vitamin B1 levels.

While Vitamin B1, potassium, and magnesium can significantly improve edema, eliminating sugar from your diet is crucial for long-term relief.

## What is the best tactic if I want to wake up refreshed?

The most important factor in quality sleep and waking up feeling refreshed is the sleep hormone called melatonin. Melatonin is triggered when you aren’t exposed to light. When it’s dark at night, and less light is shining into your eye, it activates the pineal gland, which then turns serotonin into melatonin. This makes you tired.

Any light source can potentially turn off the pineal gland and melatonin production. Melatonin is also vitally important for your immune system. Melatonin has numerous other functions as well. It’s used as an antioxidant, which helps prevent free-radicle damage. The problem with taking melatonin supplements is that your body then makes less of it. It’s not a fix to your problems. As you age, your melatonin decreases. This can cause poor sleep and immune function as you get older. It can also cause inflammation in the body.

**This is how you can enhance melatonin production before bed:**

1\. Lights out before bed

2\. Water filter for removing fluoride

3\. Glycine

4\. Reduce blue light exposure

5\. Get sun and vitamin D during the day

6\. Lower stress, caffeine, and alcohol

7\. Keep your bedroom cool

8\. Avoid EMFs

## What is the best treatment for gout, and how do therapies target its underlying causes?

Today, I’m going to share the best remedies for gout. The current medical treatment has side effects, but these natural remedies have little to no side effects.

Gout is a situation where there is a buildup of uric acid. The crystals primarily build up in the big toe, but they can build up in other places as well.

This protocol for gout involves natural remedies that help excrete uric acid and help reduce pain during a gout attack.

It’s important to note that eliminating sugar and alcohol from your diet may help improve gout symptoms. You can also try drinking more water and raising the pH of your urine to help with the symptoms of gout.

The best foods for gout are probiotic foods like sauerkraut and kimchi. Consuming large salads may also be beneficial.

The best natural gout protocol:

1\. White Chinese mulberry extract

2\. Chinese cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia)

3\. Omega-3 fatty acids (cod liver oil)

4\. Alpha-lipoic acid

5\. Devil’s claw or cat’s claw (for pain relief)

6\. Iporuru (for pain relief)

Try this protocol for at least two to three weeks, and I think you’re going to notice a difference.

## What is the correct way to take vitamin D?

Vitamin D is the most important vitamin! It’s a fat-soluble vitamin involved in 10% of our genetics. Vitamin D won’t work unless you have enough magnesium, the second most important nutrient. Magnesium is involved with 300 different enzymes and plays a vital role in regulating excess calcium. Magnesium glycinate supplements have the best absorption rate.

The more vitamin D you take, the more magnesium you’ll need. Some negative side effects associated with vitamin D, such as nausea, heart palpitations, muscle cramps, and headaches, are actually symptoms of a magnesium deficiency. Don’t take vitamin D without the important cofactor, vitamin K2. Vitamin D helps you absorb calcium, but you need vitamin K2 to drive it into the bones and teeth to keep it out of the soft tissues.

Vitamin K2 is best for calcium buildup. Take 100 mcg of vitamin K2 for every 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3.

Zinc is another important cofactor that helps you convert cholesterol into vitamin D. If you’re taking 10,000 IU of vitamin D, you should also take 20 mg of zinc.

One of the biggest vitamin D mistakes is not taking enough! You need at least 6,000 to 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 every day. Vitamin D2 does not work like vitamin D3.

The vitamin D detected in the blood is not the active form. This means you could have normal blood levels of vitamin D but still have vitamin D deficiency. Statins and steroids can inhibit your ability to make vitamin D and its ability to work in your body. The best time to get vitamin D from the sun is between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.

## What is the D-Mannose?

D-mannose is a type of sugar that will not affect your glucose levels and doesn’t get stored as a glycogen. It is really good for a UTI (urinary tract infection). The urinary system includes the kidneys, renal pelvis, ureters, bladder and urethra. If there is an infection in the urinary tract it can create pain and an urge to urinate even when the bladder is empty.

**How to consume it**

Follow the direction on the label for the proper dosage.

D-mannose attaches to the microbe called E. coli (which is involved in 90% of UTI cases) and takes it out of the system. (If it doesn’t work, that could mean that you have different types of microbes, fungus, or bacterias in your urinary tract. In such cases, use oregano oil.)

**Where to get it**

You can get it at the health food store or order it online.

## What is the distinction between folate and folic acid, particularly in terms of their forms, sources, and how the body absorbs and utilizes each?

**Folate vs. Folic Acid: What's the Difference?**

* **Folic acid:** A synthetic form of vitamin B9 often added to supplements and fortified foods.
* **Folate:** The natural form of vitamin B9 found in whole foods.

**The Problem with Folic Acid**

Many people have a genetic variation that makes it difficult for their bodies to convert folic acid into the usable form of vitamin B9. This can lead to health concerns if too much unconverted folic acid builds up.

**The Solution: Methylfolate**

Methylfolate is a readily usable form of vitamin B9 that bypasses the need for conversion. This makes it a safer and more effective choice, especially for those with genetic variation.

**Key Takeaways**

* **Opt for Methylfolate:** Choose supplements with methylfolate instead of folic acid.
*   **Focus on Food:** Get natural folate from leafy greens and other whole foods.

## What is the ideal zinc-to-copper ratio for optimal health, and how does this balance influence various physiological processes and prevent potential deficiencies or imbalances?

The recommended ratio of zinc to copper is generally 8 to 1. This means that for every 8 milligrams of zinc, you should have 1 milligram of copper. This ratio helps prevent side effects and ensures that both minerals are balanced in the body. Though the 8:1 ratio is ideal, a 4:1 to 12:1 ratio is acceptable and effective.

***

## What is the importance of trace minerals for numerous biochemical processes?

Trace minerals serve as cofactors essential for numerous biochemical processes. Obtaining sufficient amounts from a typical diet can be challenging, with sources like shellfish being notable exceptions. Furthermore, beneficial microbes in the soil play a critical role in mobilizing minerals from the soil matrix by dissolving them and making them available for plant roots to absorb. Certain farming practices can unfortunately deplete these soil microbial populations. Consequently, the absence or reduction of these microbes might limit plants' ability to take up essential minerals from the soil, contributing to nutrient deficiencies in crops.

## What is the importance of zinc for overall health?

Zinc is involved in a vast number of biochemical processes in the body, estimated to be over 200. This underscores its fundamental importance for overall health. While the immediate effects of zinc supplementation may not always be pronounced, adequate zinc intake contributes significantly to long-term well-being, potentially evidenced by stronger nails and hair. Furthermore, zinc deficiency is linked to low testosterone levels in men. Given that environmental factors, such as certain chemicals from plastics, can disrupt hormonal balance, maintaining sufficient zinc may play a supportive role in preserving hormonal health.

## What is the leading ingredient, other than sugar, that contributes to weight gain?

### Hidden in Plain Sight: The Flavor Enhancer That Could Be Sabotaging Your Health

It's lurking in your favorite snacks, convenience foods, and even restaurant meals – a seemingly innocent ingredient that could be contributing to weight gain and a host of health issues.

**Monosodium Glutamate (MSG): A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing**

Despite being classified as "generally recognized as safe" (GRAS) by the FDA, MSG, a common flavor enhancer, has a dark side. Studies have linked MSG consumption in mice to:

* **Obesity**
* **Diabetes**
* **Metabolic disorders**
* **Fatty liver disease**

**How Does MSG Impact the Body?**

* **Disrupts appetite regulation:** MSG overstimulates the hypothalamus, the brain region responsible for controlling hunger and satiety, leading to overeating.
* **Hinders energy utilization:** MSG can interfere with the body's ability to burn calories effectively.
* **Affects fertility:** Research suggests that MSG may have negative impacts on reproductive health.

The average person consumes a staggering 590 mg to 2330 mg of MSG daily, with some individuals ingesting up to 5000 mg! And when combined with carbohydrates, MSG's effects are amplified.

**Beyond Weight Gain: The Hidden Dangers of MSG**

MSG isn't just a concern for your waistline. It has also been linked to:

* **Headaches**
* **Allergy-like symptoms**
* **Irritability**
* **Sleep disturbances**
* **Dizziness**

**Unmasking Hidden MSG**

Food manufacturers are allowed to hide MSG under different names or omit it from the ingredient list altogether if it's present in small amounts. This makes it difficult to avoid.

**Foods That Often Contain MSG:**

* Instant noodles
* Chips
* Flavored popcorn
* Canned soups
* Bouillon cubes
* Processed meats
* Fast food
* Seasonings
* Salad dressings
* Frozen dinners

## What is the most beneficial nutrient for managing autoimmune conditions, and how does it support immune system regulation and overall health?

**Vitamin D and Autoimmune Disease: Dr. Coimbra's Insights**

According to Dr. Coimbra, patients with autoimmune diseases often have increased resistance to vitamin D, requiring higher doses than the average person. While general recommendations suggest 600 IU/day, some sources advocate for up to 10,000 IU/day safely.

**Key Points:**

\- Vitamin D acts as an immune regulator and reduces inflammation.

\- Resistance to vitamin D increases the risk of autoimmune diseases and other conditions.

**Causes of Vitamin D Resistance:**

\- Vitamin D polymorphism

\- Darker skin

\- Metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance

\- Obesity

\- Age

\- Lack of dietary vitamin D

\- Lack of sun exposure

**Coimbra Protocol:**

\- Dosage: 40,000 to 200,000 IU/day, guided by parathyroid hormone levels.

\- Avoid calcium and drink 2.5 liters of fluid daily to prevent hypercalcemia.

\- Consult a doctor experienced with the Coimbra protocol for proper guidance.

**Conclusion:**

Higher vitamin D doses may be necessary for autoimmune patients, but professional supervision is crucial.

## What is the most bioavailable form of magnesium for optimal absorption, and how does its effectiveness compare to other magnesium supplements in terms of health benefits?

Magnesium glycinate and magnesium citrate are two highly absorbable forms of magnesium.

## What is the most critical supplement for supporting optimal health in individuals managing diabetes?

Benfotiamine is a synthetic B1. Vitamin B1 is naturally water-soluble. Benfotiamine is a fat-soluble B1 vitamin. This is one of the only synthetic vitamins that I like because it has virtually no side-effects.

I believe every diabetic should be taking benfotiamine. Vitamin B1 is involved in the engine in the mitochondria that involves glucose metabolism. The more glucose you have running through the machine, the higher the blood sugar, and the more depleted of vitamin B1 you’re going to become.

With diabetes, there are four main tissues involved, and B1 can help with all of them:

1\. Nerves/brain - Neuropathy

2\. Eyes - Retina

3\. Kidney - Nephron

4\. Heart vessels - Microvascular endothelial dysfunction

Benfotiamine:

• 3-5x more absorption

• Protects against oxidation and AGEs

• Decreases A1C

• Protection

When it comes to benfotiamine dosage, consider taking at least 600mg of benfotiamine per day, and you can spread it out. You should also be doing healthy keto and intermittent fasting.

_**We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**_

## What is the most crucial collagen tip for achieving remarkable improvements in the health and appearance of hair, nails, and skin?

**Glycine: The Unsung Hero of Your Health**

Collagen, the protein that keeps your skin, joints, and connective tissues strong, is made up of about 30% glycine. While your body produces some glycine, it may not be enough – especially if you don't regularly eat skin and cartilage from meat.

**Why You Need Glycine**

* **Fights Inflammation:** Glycine is both a powerful anti-inflammatory and helps your body produce glutathione, its master antioxidant.
* **Supports Detoxification:** Without sufficient glycine, your body's ability to remove toxins is reduced.
* **Benefits Beyond Beauty:** Glycine is essential for healthy gums, DNA, sleep, liver function, blood sugar balance, and even weight loss.
* **Glucose Without the Spikes:** Your body can use glycine to make glucose when needed, but it also helps balance blood sugar by stimulating glucagon.

**Are You Getting Enough?**

If you don't eat a nose-to-tail diet, experience stress, take medications, drink alcohol, or are exposed to toxins, you might be deficient in glycine.

**How to Boost Your Glycine Levels**

* **Homemade Gelatin:** A delicious and easy way to increase your glycine intake.
* **Glycine Supplements:** Aim for 4 to 10 grams per day.
* **Bone Broth & Pork Rinds:** Offer some glycine, but you'll need to eat plenty to get a significant amount.

As we age, our glycine needs increase. Boosting your levels could help with conditions like osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, insomnia, and more.

## What is the most definitive and comprehensive remedy for managing gout and reducing elevated uric acid levels?

**Understanding Gout and Potential Natural Treatments**

Gout is caused by a buildup of uric acid in the body, leading to painful inflammation in joints. Traditional gout medications target the xanthine oxidase enzyme, which is responsible for producing uric acid.

While dietary changes (reducing alcohol and fructose intake) are important, they may not always be sufficient to prevent gout attacks. Researchers are exploring natural substances that might help manage gout.

Sulforaphane, found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and radish sprouts, shows promise in this area. It has a high bioavailability, meaning your body can easily absorb and use it.

**How Sulforaphane Could Help with Gout**

* **Enhancing Detoxification:** Sulforaphane may activate genes and enzymes that support the body's natural detoxification processes, potentially helping to eliminate excess uric acid.
* **Improving Kidney Function:** Some research suggests sulforaphane might promote kidney health. Healthy kidneys are essential for filtering uric acid from the body.
* **Reducing Inflammation:** Sulforaphane has antioxidant properties, which could help reduce inflammation associated with gout attacks.
* **Gut Health Support:** Sulforaphane might promote a healthy gut microbiome, indirectly supporting uric acid management.

**Important Note:** While sulforaphane offers potential benefits, it's crucial to consult your doctor before using it as a gout treatment. It's essential to get a proper diagnosis and discuss whether natural remedies are right for your specific case.

## What is the most effective adaptogen?

**An adaptogen is something that helps you cope with stress and helps your body adjust to its environment. Ashwagandha has a lot of benefits, but we’re going to focus on how it can help you adapt to stress.**

Ashwagandha has helped many people feel calmer and like they can cope with stress easier.

Ashwagandha helps control the HPA axis, which is the communication between your hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenals. These hormonal communications help the body adapt to a stress response.

Once the communication is complete, the hormone is supposed to lower back down, but with chronic stress, cortisol never goes back down and is chronically elevated. Ashwagandha can help reduce these hormones.

**Potential benefits of ashwagandha:**

• It helps lower cortisol in the AM

• It helps lower DHEA (a precursor to cortisol) in the AM

• It helps raise testosterone (stress lowers testosterone)

• It helps increase endurance

• It helps increase strength (stress may cause weakness)

• It has shown significant improvements in emotions

## What is the most effective home remedy for tinea versicolor?

Tinea versicolor is a loss of pigment due to a skin fungus. It looks similar to vitiligo but less intense. This fungus releases an acid that inhibits melanin, causing a loss of pigment. If you get it, you then have an 80% chance of getting it again.

**HOME REMEDY**

1\. Oregano oil

2\. Tea Tree Oil

3\. Thyme Oil

4\. Grapefruit Seed Oil

5\. Coconut Oil

Mix 4 drops of 1 or more of these oils in a tablespoon of coconut oil and mix - then apply it to your skin before bed. However, you need to work on your gut because ultimately, it's a loss of internal microbes that set you up for this condition. Antibiotics, cortisone treatments, being a diabetic, having PCOS, and even malnutrition can all set you up for getting this condition.

\*Please consult with a dermatologist before taking any steps to cure any skin diseases.

## What is the most effective meal for promoting arterial health and potentially reducing arterial plaque?

There is an interesting connection between your microbiome and your arteries. In mice studies, when the mice lack a healthy gut microbiome, they tend to develop a lot of inflammation. Inflammation in the arteries triggers a cascade of damaging effects. An overall imbalance of the microorganisms in the body can also lead to various problems in the arteries.

**One of the most important vitamins for the arteries is vitamin K2.** Vitamin K2 helps keep calcium buildup out of the arteries. The microbes in your gut have the ability to make vitamin K2, but fermented foods and fatty foods are also rich in vitamin K2. Keep in mind that vitamin K2 works better when taken with vitamin D3. For every 100 mcg of vitamin K2, consider taking 10,000 IU of vitamin D3.

Probiotics are crucial to support healthy arteries, and your friendly microbes are your natural probiotics. It’s important to support your microbiome and avoid sterile foods like pasteurized and over-processed foods.

**The best meal to clean out the arteries:**

• Brie cheese

• Fatty pork sausage

• Sauerkraut

Each of these foods is fermented and loaded with vitamin K2. Give them a try, and start adding other alive and fermented foods to your diet.

***

## What is the most effective natural antihistamine for managing allergy symptoms?

• Mucus

• Sneezing

• Runny nose

• Itchy eyes

• Watery eyes

• Red eyes

Certain organs, like your liver and kidneys, have enzymes that help you break down histamines. It’s important to support your liver and kidneys to help get rid of histamines.

**The best remedies for dealing with histamines are:**

1\. Grass-fed beef kidney extract

2\. Grass-fed beef liver extract

3\. Milk thistle

\*\*It’s also important to avoid consuming things high in histamines, including fermented foods and drinks. \*\*

## What is the most effective nutrient for cancer prevention and treatment, and how does it inhibit tumor growth and support cellular health?

Sulforaphane is a phytonutrient that has been studied extensively. You can get sulforaphane from many different plants, but the best source of sulforaphane is broccoli sprouts or broccoli microgreens. Broccoli sprouts or broccoli microgreens have 10 to 100 times more sulforaphane than broccoli. The majority of nutrients in plants, especially phytonutrients, are in the early stages of growth. Sprouts and microgreens also have much fewer anti-nutrients, which can irritate the gut.

Sprouts and microgreens are incredibly nutritious and are great choices if you have a hard time consuming large amounts of vegetables. You can consume fewer of them to get a good amount of nutrients and phytonutrients.

**Potential benefits of microgreens and sprouts (sulforaphane):**

1\. May help prevent chronic disease

2\. Has potent anti-inflammatory effects

3\. May have anticancer effects

4\. May help inhibit carcinogens

5\. Has potent antimicrobial effects

6\. Has powerful blood sugar effects

7\. May be beneficial in preventing heart disease

8\. Has been studied for autism

9\. Has anti-aging effects

10\. Helps support the brain

## What is the most effective remedy for bronchitis?

**You can use salt.** Not necessarily taking salt, but breathing in salt. There’s a machine called a halogenerator, which provides something called halotherapy where you breathe salt air. The machine ionizes the salt and puts it out into the air. You can use it while you sleep.

**Halotherapy** can loosen up the mucus in your lungs, sinuses, and throat. Salt has the capacity to thin out the mucus. It’s antifungal, antibacterial, and it’s also anti-mold. I’ve put links below to some machines that I think are good. (I’m not affiliated with the companies that make them.)

**Another option is to use something called a neti pot to wash out your sinuses with salt water.** Check your house for mold or mildew, which could be why your lungs are constantly filled with mucus. If you change locations, you might be surprised at how your sinus or lung condition goes away.

**From a nutritional standpoint, oregano oil is really good to treat mucus.**

## What is the most effective remedy for clearing plaque buildup in the arteries?

A clogged artery is an artery that’s filled with plaque. In many cases, when a person has clogged arteries, they also have stiff arteries, inflammation, and high blood pressure.

**Many people seek natural alternatives for clogged arteries because the common treatments often have side effects. Potential side effects of these treatments can include:**

• Myopathy

• Erectile dysfunction

• Low testosterone

• Neuropathy

• Dementia

• Hemorrhagic stroke

• Increased risk of cancer

The best natural remedy to unclog your arteries is called nattokinase. Nattokinase is an enzyme in natto (fermented soybeans). Fermented soybeans are also loaded with vitamin K2.

**Potential benefits of nattokinase:**

1\. It may help break up clots

2\. It may help clear up nasal polyps

3\. It may help decrease oxidized LDL

4\. It has anti-inflammatory properties

5\. It may help lower blood pressure

6\. It inhibits the thickening of the artery walls

## What is the most effective remedy for depression?

There is an interesting link between BDNF and depression. It’s been found that there is no way to diagnose depression. But, it was also found that people who are depressed have low levels of BDNF. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important molecule involved in learning and memory.

So an interesting question is how to enhance BDNF. All of the trials delivering BDNF into the central nervous system have failed. So, how can we enhance it naturally?

BDNF is basically a fertilizer for the brain. It helps with nerve growth, nerve differentiation, and the maintenance of the synapse between the nerves.

**Benefits of BDNF:**

* It can help improve learning
* It can help improve long-term memory
* It helps higher thinking
* It helps you think more clearly
* It helps you become more mentally alert
* It can decrease inflammation
* It can increase the absorption of neurotransmitters

**Things to help enhance BDNF and get out of depression:**

* Deep sleep (at least 7 high-quality hours of deep sleep)
* Exercise (the fastest and most effective method of increasing BDNF)
* Sunlight
* Intermittent fasting and periodic prolonged fasting
* Healthy Keto®
* Avoiding sugar
* Magnesium

It has antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-yeast, and anti-mold properties. Salt is also really good for breaking up thick mucus. There are many different ways you can use salt as a remedy for mucus. If you live near the ocean, you could simply drive to the coast and breathe in the salty air. If you’re not near the coast, you can dissolve one teaspoon of sea salt in a glass of warm water and drink it.

**Other ways to use sea salt for mucus include:**

• Going to a salt house

• Using a neti pot

• Using a nebulizer

• Gargling with saltwater

• Halotherapy

Most respiratory infections are viral-related, so antibiotics won’t be helpful. You have to give a viral infection time to go away, but during that time, it’s crucial to support your immune system.

## What is the most effective remedy for the pain in the back?

Sciatica is pain down the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve comes from the lumbar spine all the way down the back part of the leg and into the foot. It’s the longest and biggest nerve in the body. The sciatic nerve needs certain nutrients to function correctly. But, the deficiency that will create the most damage to the sciatic nerve is a vitamin B2 deficiency (riboflavin). But, B12 and B1 are also important. Taking the whole B complex may be the best way to go. Benfotiamine may also be beneficial. Benfotiamine is fat-soluble B1.

A vitamin B2 deficiency can be caused by not consuming enough foods that are high in vitamin B2. But, it can also be caused by a problem with the gut that destroys your ability to absorb nutrients. In this situation, you may just need more than the average amount of B2.

**Foods high in vitamin B2:**

• Liver

• Beef

• Clams (and other shellfish)

• Mushrooms

•Nuts

• Cheese

• Eggs

• Fish

## What is the most effective remedy for the prevention and treatment of dental plaque and tartar accumulation?

Today, I’m going to show you how to make natural toothpaste to help eliminate tartar and prevent it from coming back.

Tartar is a calcified, pale, yellow, hard substance that accumulates on your teeth. It can lead to gingivitis as well as bad breath. Tartar is made up of a colony of bacteria that survives in something called a biofilm.

Biofilms contain bacteria, fungi, yeast, and candida. Tartar biofilms ferment carbohydrates in your mouth and release lactic acid, which can leach away your calcium and cause cavities.

Many ancient cultures used natural toothpaste, but these recipes were very abrasive and wore down the teeth.

This homemade toothpaste recipe is far more gentle yet still effective at removing plaque.

To make this toothpaste, combine the following ingredients:

•3 drops of either clove oil, peppermint oil, or cinnamon oil, or a pinch of turmeric powder

•¼ teaspoon hydrogen peroxide

•¼ teaspoon baking soda

•¼ teaspoon raw honey or manuka honey

•½ cup water

Mix these ingredients and brush your teeth with the mixture using a soft bristle toothbrush twice per day.

Vitamin K2 has also shown promising results in removing and preventing tartar buildup.

## What is the most effective remedy or treatment approach for managing gastric cardiac syndrome?

**Well, I think what I would do is I would take something called betaine hydrochloride with the meals.** I would take probably five of those little guys right before a meal.

There's this interesting connection between your digestive system and the heart and also the liver and the bile ducts and the heart. They're right, kind of connected, close together. So when you have, um, uh, incomplete digestion or maybe even bile sludge in your little bile ducts, which is very common, that can back up, create congestion in the heart and you can start having heart symptoms from your digestion.

**So one great remedy is to make sure that you're not having any indigestion by taking more betaine hydrochloride and that can be taken right before a meal.** But the other thing relates to the bile ducts.

**TUDCA is a great remedy to open up those ducts to make sure that you don't have this backup into the liver, which is causing pressure on the heart.**

TUDCA, you take that in an empty stomach, two, twice a day, and that seems to resolve a lot of problems within your gut, your gallbladder ducts and in that associated area. A lot of people don't even know they have that problem, but they get a lot of bloating and a fullness underneath their right rib cage.

## What is the most effective remedy to reverse wrinkles?

In this video, we’re going to talk about how to reverse wrinkles. GAG (glycosaminoglycan) helps hydrate and repair the skin and collagen, and helps make collagen. The hormone that controls GAG is IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1). IGF-1 is triggered by growth hormone, which is the anti-aging hormone. There are a few things you can do to actually trigger this hormone naturally.

How to reverse wrinkles:

1\. Lower insulin (do healthy keto and intermittent fasting)

2\. Enhance your sleep and lower cortisol

3\. Do HIIT (high-intensity interval training)

4\. Consume a moderate amount of quality protein (3-6 oz. with each meal)

5\. Enhance the liver (avoid alcohol, eat organic, consume a lot of vegetables, take supplements to support the liver)

6\. Do Intermittent fasting (IGF-1 is stimulated when you’re not eating)

7\. Take fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K2)

## What is the most effective vitamin for promoting the shrinking of fibroids?

Up to 80% of women will develop fibroids by age 40. In this video, we'll take a look at the causes of fibroids that could be related to vitamin deficiency. Find out how to help shrink fibroids naturally and alleviate fibroid symptoms with one vitamin. Fibroids decrease in size after menopause, yet pregnancy, exposure to HRT, and birth control pills can cause fibroids to enlarge. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and PCOS also increase the risk of fibroids. Black women have a 3 to 9 times higher risk of developing fibroids.

Estrogen is the primary driver of fibroids and endometriosis. A fibroid is a growth in the uterus, but it differs from uterine tissue in several ways. Fibroids are very sensitive to estrogen and have increased estrogen receptors, more of the enzyme aromatase, less oxygen than the uterus, and more inflammation.

Many health problems and risk factors associated with fibroids are related to low vitamin D. Vitamin D has incredible properties that may help inhibit the growth of fibroids.

There is also a vast amount of anecdotal evidence in support of using vitamin D to shrink fibroids.

Be sure to take vitamin D with the cofactors magnesium and vitamin K2.

It's important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, including vitamin D, to ensure proper dosage and to discuss any potential interactions with other medications or health conditions.

## What is the most effective vitamin?

Leo Pharma and Almirall are two pharmaceutical companies that specialize in dermatology. Many of their products contain synthetic vitamin D for skin problems. Coincidentally, these companies also played a role in the sun-phobia movement. The sun is one of the best remedies for skin problems like eczema and psoriasis.

You need at least 10,000 IUs of vitamin d3 every day to maintain healthy vitamin D levels! Sunbathing was once popular worldwide and was used to prevent tuberculosis and various health conditions. However, after the development of antibiotics, its popularity drastically declined.

Dr. William Grant has done extensive research on vitamin D. He explains that 84,532 papers have been published on vitamin D, the most studied bioactive molecule. Despite the evidence, there is still controversy regarding the health benefits of vitamin D. Tens of thousands of research studies have been conducted on the benefits of vitamin D for cancer.

Big Pharma has influenced studies that discredit the benefits of vitamin D. Only small amounts of vitamin D were used in most studies that do not show favorable outcomes with vitamin D.

Dr. Cicero Coimbra, who developed the Coimbra protocol, has seen a 90% success rate in using vitamin D for autoimmune diseases. Some people have vitamin D resistance, which involves a genetic problem with vitamin D. Blood tests can not accurately determine vitamin D deficiency. It is vital to keep your vitamin D levels over 50 ng/mL to avoid vitamin D deficiency.

## What is the most potent treatment for eradicating candida infections?

Now, we normally have candida living in our bodies without any issue. But when you take an antibiotic, your defenses are lowered and you end up with an overgrowth of candida. This is a fungal infection caused by yeast, the most common being candida Albicans.

If this infection turns your tongue white, that’s a condition called thrush. Sometimes the white patches are on the inside of your cheek; sometimes there are small red patches on your tongue. If the infection is in your vagina, it’s called a yeast infection. If in your esophagus, it’s called candida esophagitis.

Garlic is, hands down, the most powerful fungus killer. It also works on toenail fungus. Garlic has a natural phytochemical called ajoene that’s responsible for its power to kill fungus. Ajoene is also a natural blood thinner; drug companies are researching it to use in medication for blood clotting disorders.

Crush up fresh garlic and put it in your food on a regular basis. But you also have to fix your diet! Lower your sugar intake. Reduce your consumption of milk sugar. I recommend a healthy keto plan with intermittent fasting. If you’re consuming garlic but your sugar and carb consumption is still high, I doubt your fungal infection will go away. You want to starve off the fungus and re-establish the friendly flora in your body.

I also recommend a type of probiotic called effective microbes, to help your gut flora. Garlic has many other phytochemicals that provide you with health benefits. Not only is it anti-fungal, but antibacterial and antiviral as well. Garlic has been shown to be very effective for basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer.

Now you can see how effective garlic is to kill candida.

## What is the most valuable vitamin in handling of high blood pressure?

Vitamin D is the most important vitamin for the inside of the arteries, yet it’s often ignored in cases of hypertension. Ninety percent of hypertension is considered essential, which means the cause is unknown. However, I believe it's likely linked to vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is vital in supporting and protecting the endothelial layer of your arteries.

The benefits of vitamin D for your arteries include:

1\. Potent anti-inflammatory effects

2\. Potent antioxidant effects

3\. Increased nitric oxide

Nitric oxide keeps the arteries in a state of vasodilation and relaxation. Without enough nitric oxide, the arteries become tight, and blood pressure rises. When the endothelial layer of the artery becomes dysfunctional, you no longer produce nitric oxide. You won't absorb much calcium if you don't have enough vitamin D. This can cause your parathyroid hormone to increase to remove calcium from the bone and put it into the blood. If you are chronically low in vitamin D, the parathyroid hormone will continue to rob calcium from the bone, creating osteoporosis.

Many doctors do not recommend large doses of vitamin D in fear of vitamin D toxicity. Clinical data does not support vitamin D toxicity! Dr. Bruce Hollis, a pioneer in vitamin D research, has personally never seen a case. Vitamin K2 can help remove calcium from the arteries and put it into the teeth and bones. Magnesium regulates excess calcium and helps to prevent cardiovascular problems. Vitamin D protects your arteries by decreasing inflammation and supporting the vascular cells. Vitamin D, magnesium, and K2 can help prevent calcium from developing in the wrong places, helping to prevent high blood pressure. Aim for 30,000 IU of vitamin D daily if you have high blood pressure.

## What is the number 1 superfood in the world?

**Red Meat: The Underrated Superfood**

Move over, green powder! While we love the benefits of greens, there's another superfood that deserves a spot on your plate: **grass-fed red meat**.

**Why Red Meat is a Nutritional Powerhouse:**

* **Complete Protein:** Unlike green powders, red meat provides all the essential amino acids your body needs to build and repair tissues, create enzymes and hormones, and support a healthy immune system.
* **Nutrient-Dense:** Red meat is packed with B vitamins, fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), iron, zinc, selenium, and even DHA – an omega-3 fat crucial for brain health.
* **Antioxidant Power:** Red meat is a rich source of glutathione, a master antioxidant, and carnosine, which helps protect against cellular damage.
* **Blood Sugar Control:** The protein in red meat triggers glucagon, a hormone that helps stabilize blood sugar and counter the effects of insulin.
* **Building Blocks for Your Body:** Protein is essential for building and maintaining muscle, collagen, bones, skin, and even your cell membranes.
* **Unique Amino Acids:** Red meat contains taurine, which helps regulate blood pressure, and leucine, an amino acid that stimulates muscle protein synthesis.
* **Energy Production:** Your body can convert protein into glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis, providing a steady source of energy.
* **Appetite Control:** The "protein leverage hypothesis" suggests that we instinctively eat until we meet our protein needs. This explains why protein-rich foods help us feel full and satisfied, reducing the urge to overeat.
* **Oxygen Delivery:** Red meat is rich in myoglobin, an iron-containing protein that helps transport oxygen throughout the body.

**Grass-Fed Advantage:**

Cows, sheep, and goats that graze on pasture have a unique ability to concentrate nutrients from the grass into their meat, making grass-fed red meat even more nutrient-dense.

**The Perfect Pairing:**

Combine the benefits of green powder with the power of grass-fed red meat for a truly optimal nutritional boost.

**Important Note:** While red meat offers numerous health benefits, it's essential to choose high-quality, grass-fed sources and consume it as part of a balanced diet.

It may take up to six months to start seeing benefits from TUDCA. However, some people see results in just four weeks.

Studies lasting up to 12 months have shown TUDCA to be well-tolerated and safe, even in those with liver cirrhosis and people who have had liver transplants.

***

## What is the optimal time to take probiotics for maximizing their effectiveness, and how does timing impact their benefits?

Probiotics are microbes. Microbes are a crucial part of our world. They convert carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur into forms that living things can use. We have ten times more microbes living on and inside our bodies than we have cells.

**Microbes have many functions and help us in various ways, including:**

• Helping to make nutrients available

• Providing immune protection

• Protecting against pathogens

• Supporting detoxification

• Improving digestion

• Helping to make vitamins

Strong hydrochloric acid in the stomach can kill a good portion of microbes. Bile salts also affect the microbiome. But, some microbes are resilient and can even live without oxygen.

**How to support the survival of probiotics in the stomach:**

1\. Take a probiotic supplement or consume probiotic foods at the end of your meal

2\. Consume probiotics earlier in the day

3\. If fasting, drink more water with your probiotics

4\. Don’t take probiotics with lemon water or apple cider vinegar water

5\. Consume raw plants grown in soil

***

## What is the optimal timing for taking specific vitamins to maximize their effectiveness and absorption, and how does timing impact their benefits?

**Optimizing Supplement Timing**

**Morning Supplements**

For energy and metabolism, take B-complex vitamins, especially B12, in the morning with breakfast. Research shows B vitamins can reduce fatigue and improve cognitive performance.

**Evening Supplements**

For relaxation and better sleep, consider magnesium before bedtime. Studies indicate magnesium can enhance sleep quality, particularly in those with sleep disturbances.

**Supplement Intake Considerations**

\- **With Food vs. Empty Stomach:** Iron is best absorbed on an empty stomach, while calcium should be taken with food to increase absorption. A 2015 study showed a 22% increase in calcium absorption when taken with a meal.

\- **Health Conditions:** Adjust supplement timing based on health conditions and medications. For instance, thyroid medication should be taken on an empty stomach, with a wait of 30 minutes before consuming other supplements or food. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.

***

## What is the optimal volume of water required to achieve effective rehydration after dehydration due to factors such as physical exertion or insufficient fluid intake?

How much water it takes to rehydrate depends on how much fluid your body lost. Drinking plenty of water is crucial to rehydrate your body. However, replenishing lost electrolytes is equally important. Without adequate electrolyte levels, water can’t enter cells and tissues, leaving you at risk of dehydration despite drinking water.

## What is the quickest method to alleviate stress and achieve immediate relaxation?

Certain stressors on the body, like exercise, heat therapy, or cold therapy, are in your control and have positive effects on the body. But, negative stress is out of your control and can have harmful effects. This lack of control could be related to a situation, condition, or relationship.

**In a stress state, you have a lot of involuntary glandular secretions and reactions occurring. Two parts of the body have both involuntary and voluntary control: the diaphragm and skeletal muscles.**

Controlled breathing exercises and walking are powerful to put yourself back in control of these systems and pull yourself out of a reactive fight or flight mode.

It’s also important to understand that a vitamin B1 deficiency can mimic mild hypoxia and trigger your stress reflexes. Vitamin B1 is crucial to help pull yourself out of a stress state and even prevent stress.

**Overall, the best things when dealing with stress are:**

1\. Controlled breathing exercises

2\. Walks

3\. Vitamin B1

## What is the recommended daily dosage of strontium citrate for optimal health benefits, and how should it be adjusted based on individual needs?

When it comes to supplementing with individual minerals, especially trace minerals, it is crucial to approach with caution. Long-term supplementation with a single trace mineral can potentially disrupt the balance of other essential minerals in the body. To mitigate this risk, it is advisable to take these minerals as part of a complete trace mineral complex. This ensures a balanced intake and reduces the likelihood of imbalances.

For instance, when supplementing with zinc, it is important to also consider copper and other related minerals. The interactions and synergies among these minerals are complex and not yet fully understood. Hence, taking them in a comprehensive complex can help maintain proper mineral balance and support overall health.

Similarly, when using electrolytes, ensure they include trace minerals as part of the formulation. This holistic approach ensures that all minerals work together synergistically, enhancing their effectiveness and maintaining balance within the body.

In summary, rather than taking individual trace minerals for extended periods, it is more prudent to opt for a balanced mineral complex. This strategy helps prevent potential imbalances and supports the intricate interplay of minerals necessary for optimal health.

## What is the recommended diet for individuals with HIV/AIDS, and how can it support immune function and overall health?

When you have HIV, over time, if the immune system is weak, it can shift to AIDS. AIDS is a condition where you don't really have an immune system anymore. This condition targets a key player in your immune system called the T helper cell. Without the T helper cells, your immune system can't work how it needs to. Without these cells, you can also develop serious secondary problems like tumors or cancer.

Glutathione is the key antioxidant for all your cells, and it's intimately involved with your immune system. However, HIV depletes the precursors to make glutathione. If you were to build up these precursors, and therefore, your glutathione, you could potentially prevent the transition of HIV to AIDS. Other viruses use this mechanism, including hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and coxsackie.

**A potential natural protocol for HIV and AIDS:**

• Selenium (400 mcg)

• Cysteine

• Glutamine

• Tryptophan

• NAC

## What is the recommended protocol for managing and treating calcified plaque in the arteries?

**What you could do for calcification in the arteries:**

1\. Allicin This is a phytonutrient in garlic. There is some interesting research on the association of allicin and decreased artery calcification in animals.

2\. Butyrate This is a compound that the microbes in the gut make when you feed them fiber (vegetable fiber). It’s a type of fat, a small-chain fatty acid. Butyrate has been associated with a decreased risk of artery disease.

3\. Lycopene This is a phytonutrient in certain vegetables. There is some interesting data showing how lycopene can decrease the thickness of the wall of the arteries and decrease the stiffness.

4\. Omega-3 fatty acids You can find this in cod liver oil or fish oils. Omega-3 fatty acids may help decrease inflammation.

5\. GLA (gamma-linolenic acid) This is a type of omega-6 fatty acid that is actually friendly to your arteries. A few examples would be borage oil, black currant seed oil, and evening primrose oil. GLA may help decrease inflammation, decrease the thickness of the arteries, and decrease plaque formation in the arteries.

6\. Vitamin K2 (MK-7 version) You may want to consider consuming 300mcg of vitamin K2 every day. Vitamin K2 can activate a certain protein that inhibits calcium from forming in the arteries.

7\. Tocotrienols This is one form of the vitamin E complex. Tocotrienols can greatly decrease inflammation in the arteries.

8\. Decrease insulin resistance Do whatever you can to decrease and reverse insulin resistance. There is a direct relationship between having insulin resistance and having calcification in the arteries. A lot of these other remedies may not work unless you also fix insulin resistance. You can help fix insulin resistance by doing the healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting.

**The most important combination:**

• Address insulin resistance

• Tocotrienols

• Vitamin K2

• Allicin

• Omega-3 fatty acids

**Secondary**:

• Butyrate

• Lycopene

• GLA

## What is the recommended way to use ashwagandha for normalizing elevated cortisol levels, and how does it contribute to regulating stress hormones?

**Ashwagandha is an herb that has been around for a very long time and has minimal side effects.**

**Potential benefits of ashwagandha:**

• It’s an incredible adaptogen (it helps you cope with stress and depression)

• It may help increase exercise performance

• It may help decrease cortisol

• It may help reduce fibroids

• It has anti-inflammatory properties

• It may help improve the immune system

• It supports cognitive function

• It may help lower blood sugar levels

It seems like natural alternatives are always attacked. Recently, there has been some fear around ashwagandha because, like other natural remedies, it’s not FDA-approved. The committees that approve drugs have a lot of conflicts of interest. Many medications that are FDA-approved have a massive number of side effects, but people take them without hesitation. You may find it beneficial to try ashwagandha and come off of it for a while to see how you feel. Ashwagandha is powerful for stress, but you may not need it after you change your lifestyle and get rid of stress.

Natural remedies are great tools but aren’t meant to be taken for the rest of your life.

## What is the remedy for the liver cirrhosis caused by Hepatitis C?

When you have hepatitis C or some other virus attacking the liver, this may cause high amounts of iron in the body. The iron is inflammatory and creates oxidative damage. Normally your liver gets rid of excess iron in the body. However if your liver is infected, for example with hepatitis C, it will not be able to remove this iron, which will cause further damage. One thing to know is that viruses and bacteria grow by consuming iron. This situation can eventually turn into cirrhosis of the liver.

**Remedies:**

* Consume lactoferrin
* Do an intermittent fasting plan
* Do periodic prolonged fasting
* Consume vitamin D (at least 20,000 IU / day)
* Consume natural antibiotics
  * garlic
  * clove
  * thyme
  * oregano oil
  * grapefruit seed extract

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## What is the significant role of lutein in supporting and enhancing both eye and brain health, and how does it contribute to overall cognitive and visual function?

Lutein is a powerful carotenoid that supports both eye and brain health. Found in many fruits and vegetables, it helps combat oxidative stress and harmful light.

**Protecting Retinal Health**

Lutein accumulates in the macula, enhancing macular pigment optical density (MPOD), which filters out damaging blue light. This helps prevent age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss. Higher MPOD is linked to better visual acuity and contrast sensitivity.

**Boosting Cognitive Abilities**

Lutein also benefits the brain, particularly in regions linked to memory and learning. Higher dietary lutein levels are associated with improved cognitive function and reduced risk of age-related cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease. Its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties may protect brain cells and support optimal brain function.

## What is the underlying mechanism by which hyaluronic acid exerts its effects at the molecular and cellular levels within biological systems?

Having enough [vitamin A](https://www.drberg.com/blog/vitamin-a-functions-and-deficiencies) actually increases hyaluronic acid production. This might be why people who are deficient in this vital vitamin tend to have problems with dry eyes and skin. Even the fluid within your eye contains large amounts of hyaluronic acid.

What many don't realize is that after a certain age, this crucial compound begins to decline in our bodies. You primarily start to see a reduction in hyaluronic acid around your 40s and 50s.

By the time you are 80 years old, you will have lost nearly 80% of your natural hyaluronic acid production. This decline can lead to noticeable changes in the skin, such as wrinkles and sagging.

To give you a better idea of the powerful effects of hyaluronic acid, consider the rare genetic disease called progeria, which causes children to age rapidly.

Kids with progeria experience a 20-fold reduction in hyaluronic acid levels compared to individuals who do not have this rare condition.

When comparing images of young skin to those with older, more mature skin, the differences are easy to spot. Older skin wrinkles and sags, making it usually easy to spot someone who is deficient in hyaluronic acid and doesn’t reap its amazing skin benefits.

## What lifestyle changes can promote longevity, improve health, and reduce age-related diseases?

If we look at risk factors for heart disease, high LDL increases your risk by 38 percent. But insulin resistance increases your risk by 540 percent.

Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, like diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension, can be caused by insulin resistance. This seems to mean that insulin resistance is the biggest risk factor for premature cardiac death.

The most popular mainstream treatment for high cholesterol is statin drugs. Studies have shown that statins can potentially lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. Healthy mitochondria are essential to longevity. Statins may also impair the mitochondria and increase apoptosis (death of the mitochondria).

An interesting study links higher LDL cholesterol to inversely affecting mortality. This means that having higher LDL may help extend your lifespan. Cholesterol is involved in a myriad of functions in the body—it’s essential for a healthy life.

Blood thinners and even the heart-healthy diet recommended by the American Heart Association can also contribute to insulin resistance and high blood sugar. To live longer, improving insulin resistance, making insulin more sensitive, and stabilizing your blood sugar is crucial.

**The most important things you can do to support healthy insulin and blood sugar include:**

1\. Getting on a low-carb diet (the ketogenic diet)

2\. Doing intermittent fasting

3\. Not restricting cholesterol

4\. Consuming vegetables

5\. Exercising

## What remedies or interventions would you recommend for managing dementia?

Lupron is known for suppressing certain cancers by inhibiting luteinizing hormone (LH), which in turn reduces sex hormones like progesterone and testosterone. Recent studies suggest that Lupron may also alleviate dementia symptoms. Elevated LH levels, commonly seen in Alzheimer's patients, contribute to decreased progesterone—a crucial neurosteroid that supports neuron development, reduces brain inflammation, enhances serotonin, and maintains blood-brain barrier integrity.

As progesterone levels decline with age, particularly after menopause in women and around age 70 in men, melatonin, DHEA, and pregnenolone can help mitigate this decline. Melatonin, in particular, can lower LH and indirectly boost progesterone levels. Research indicates that melatonin and exercise may slow dementia progression. To increase melatonin naturally, reduce light exposure before bedtime, increase sun exposure, or use infrared light, which provides about 95% of melatonin's benefits.

## What remedies or treatments are recommended for managing or improving myopia?

**The problem is that you're like me as well. When you do a lot of reading, you eventually need glasses. So getting outside, looking in the far distance, reversing this stuck, fixated view that you and a lot of people have on their computers.**

So I think it's a combination of a lot of screen time and reading and not enough looking in the distance to reverse that, because what happens is a little muscle and the eye that becomes enlarged and it starts to affect the shape of the lens and it can actually create all sorts of issues.

## What role does the liver play in the regulation of LDL cholesterol levels?

The liver plays a crucial role in the production and regulation of cholesterol, including LDL (low-density lipoprotein). Here are the key points that explain the correlation between the liver and high LDL:

* **Cholesterol Production**: The liver is responsible for producing about 75% of the body's total cholesterol. This production is influenced by dietary intake, particularly the consumption of fats, especially saturated fats. When you consume more fats, the liver increases the production of LDL cholesterol.
* **Response to Diet**: The liver's production of cholesterol is not random; it responds to what you eat. Higher intake of saturated fats prompts the liver to produce more LDL cholesterol.
* **LDL's Role**: LDL, often labeled as 'bad cholesterol,' has essential functions, such as ferrying cholesterol to arteries for repair and defense against bacterial toxins. However, high levels of LDL can contribute to the buildup of plaques in arteries, leading to atherosclerosis and increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
* **Bile Production**: The liver also produces bile, which is crucial for breaking down fats and managing cholesterol levels. Adequate bile production helps in the proper digestion of fats and prevents the unnecessary buildup of cholesterol.

In summary, the liver's role in cholesterol production and regulation is significant. Dietary choices and liver health directly impact LDL levels, highlighting the importance of maintaining a balanced diet and a healthy liver to manage cholesterol levels effectively.

## What safety precautions should be observed when consuming dandelions, and how can potential risks be minimized?

**Safety Considerations for Using Dandelions**

1\. **Moderation**: Consume dandelions in moderation to avoid digestive discomfort. Start with small amounts of greens, tea, or roots and gradually increase as tolerated.

2\. **Consult Healthcare Providers**: If you have existing health conditions or take medications, consult with your healthcare provider before incorporating dandelions into your regimen. They may interact with certain drugs, such as diuretics and blood thinners.

For optimal health benefits, work with your healthcare team to integrate dandelions safely and effectively into your wellness plan.

## What should I do if I continue to experience bloating despite drinking apple cider vinegar?

These are the symptoms of low stomach acid:

● Inability to absorb minerals, leading to a potential deficiency of iron, calcium, or any other minerals

● Decreased ability to absorb amino acids, which can show up as hair loss, loose skin, or incomplete digestion of protein, among other things

● Leaky gut, which can lead to allergies

● Bloating, abdominal pain, and acid reflux

● SIBO, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, when bacteria grow where they shouldn’t, in your small intestine, and whenever you consume fiber or probiotics it gets worse

● An infection in your lower digestive tract

● Constipation or diarrhea

● Sluggish gallbladder

You can take betaine hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar to improve stomach acid. Fasting also helps, as does drinking coffee. But so too does taking vitamin B3 (niacin).

Common symptoms of B3 deficiency include anxiety, depression, fatigue, and skin problems, which the B3 you do have will address first, possibly preventing it from making more stomach acid. There’s a condition called B3 dependency, which may be caused by stress or certain microbes. When you’re stressed, your body oxidizes adrenaline and needs B3 to replenish it. And because tryptophan converts to B3, you need enough stomach acid to do so.

As well, you need B3 to produce the energy called ATP from the mitochondria in your stomach cells. If you think you have low stomach acid, I recommend you take 50 to 100 milligrams of vitamin B3 per day, or more if you’re really stressed.

## What should you consume in the first trimester if you’re dealing with nausea and food aversions?

The most important thing is the diet. I would be careful about doing the rice.

I would go back to what I recommend is the basic keto plan and find out maybe instead of doing heavy fatty foods you do. You do like maybe less fatty foods, but you definitely need animal source nutrients for the best bioavailable source of amino acids and nutrition, because this is the time where that that baby is being fortified and developing. And so you don't want to have any deficiencies.

_\*Anything I say is not meant to diagnose or replace your medical care check with a doctor before implementing any of these suggestions._

## What specific nutrients are essential for mitigating plaque buildup in the arteries, and how do they contribute to cardiovascular health?

**Understanding Plaque**

* **Composition:** Plaque consists of cholesterol, calcium, and protein. It forms within arteries in response to inflammation or injury.
* **Types:**
  * **Soft plaque:** Unstable and prone to rupture, leading to serious complications.
  * **Hard plaque:** Calcified, more stable, and less immediately dangerous.

**Testing for Plaque**

* **CAC Test:** The Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) test primarily detects hardened plaque, often underestimating the risk of soft plaque.
* **The CAC Paradox:** After improving your diet, your CAC score may increase. This doesn't mean your condition worsens; it reflects the stabilization of soft plaque into hard plaque, which is less dangerous in the short term.

**LDL and Plaque Risk**

* **LDL Types:**
  * **Small, dense LDL:** Highly damaging, linked to increased oxidation and plaque formation.
  * **Large, buoyant LDL:** Less harmful.
* **Testing:** Measuring myeloperoxidase and Lp-PLA2 levels, or using ultrasound, can indicate the presence of soft plaque.

**Improving Your Lipid Profile**

* **HDL:** Higher levels of "good" HDL help remove harmful LDL.
* **Triglycerides:** High triglycerides often signal excess carbohydrates in the diet.
* **Lipoprotein Insulin Resistance (LP-IR):** This test can be a strong marker for cardiovascular risk.
* **LDL/ApoB Ratio:** Here’s how to determine whether you have small dense LDL or large buoyant LDL. Divide the LDL by ApoB—the part of the lipoprotein that indicates the number of particles. You want your result to be greater than 1.2. This indicates large buoyant LDL.

The following nutrients may help remove arterial plaque buildup naturally:

1. Pycnogenol–150 mg
2. Gotu Kola–450 mg
3. Vitamin K2–Life Extension Mega K2
4. Nattokinase
5. Niacin

Vitamin K2 is the most potent inhibitor of vascular calcification. Tocotrienols, berberine, aged garlic, magnesium, potassium, and vitamin D also help to clean out plaque naturally.

## What specific nutrients are known to support prostate health, and how do they contribute to the prevention and management of prostate-related conditions?

Dr. Berg emphasizes several nutrients and foods that support prostate health. Here are the key points:

1. **Zinc**:
   * Zinc is crucial for maintaining prostate health. A zinc deficiency is associated with inflammation and enlargement of the prostate gland, as well as an increased risk of prostate cancer.
   * Zinc helps regulate the flow of urine and plays an essential role in the production of male sex hormones, including testosterone.
2. **Cruciferous Vegetables**:
   * Vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts benefit prostate health.
   * These vegetables contain indoles, which help detoxify excess estrogen, promoting hormonal balance.
   * Broccoli, in particular, is noted for its cancer-fighting properties and is especially good for breast and prostate cancer.
3. **Healthy Keto Diet**:
   * A well-structured keto meal plan that includes nutrient-dense foods such as lean meats, fatty fish, leafy greens, and cruciferous vegetables supports hormonal balance by reducing estrogen levels over time.
4. **Saw Palmetto and Nettle Root**:
   * Saw palmetto is used to alleviate urinary symptoms related to an enlarged prostate (BPH).
   * Nettle root exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and aids in improving urine flow among men with BPH.
5. **Avoiding Phytic Acid**:
   * Phytic acid in whole grains and cereals can block zinc absorption. Reducing the intake of these foods can help improve zinc absorption.

These nutrients and dietary recommendations are aimed at supporting prostate health and managing conditions like Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). Always consult a healthcare provider before making significant dietary changes, especially if you have other medical conditions.

## What steps can be taken to aid in the dissolution of gallstones?

**Worried about gallstones? Natural remedies might help!**

If you have a few gallstones, natural approaches could be worth exploring. Gallstones form when cholesterol becomes overly concentrated in your bile, lacking enough bile salts to keep it dissolved.

**Here's how to help dissolve gallstones naturally:**

1. **Increase Omega-3s:** Found in fatty fish and fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce cholesterol saturation in your bile. Cod liver oil is a great choice, offering the bonus of vitamins A and D.
2. **Supplement with Bile Salts:** Your body produces bile salts, but you can also take them in supplement form to help dissolve existing stones and prevent new ones from forming.

**Factors that may increase gallstone risk (and how to address them):**

* **High Insulin:** Reduce your intake of carbohydrates to help regulate insulin levels.
* **Elevated Cortisol:** Manage stress through relaxation techniques, exercise, and adequate sleep.
* **Estrogen Dominance:** If you suspect estrogen dominance, consult a healthcare professional to discuss ways to balance your hormones.

**Important Note:** While these natural remedies can be helpful, it's crucial to consult your doctor for diagnosis and to discuss the best treatment plan for your specific situation.

## What steps can I take if I’m so exhausted that I struggle to fall asleep?

While some people have too much energy to fall asleep, others are actually too tired to fall asleep. It takes a healthy amount of energy in your energy factories, your mitochondria, to sleep well. The organs that have the most mitochondria are your heart and brain. This means that both of these organs need a lot of oxygen to function properly. Thankfully, there are several things you can do to increase oxygen into the mitochondria in the brain to help you fall asleep fast and have a good night’s sleep. There is also, essentially, a clock in your brain that tells you when to sleep and when to wake up—we need to get this clock to work better.

**How to sleep better at night:**

• Exercise

• Consume vitamin B1 before bed

• Sleep with the window open

• Put plants in your room

• Consume CoQ10

• Take methylene blue

• Use dim lights after sunset

• Replace certain lights in your house with incandescent lights

• Avoid blue light before bed

• Use red lights

• Use the light from a fireplace if possible

• Use blue blockers

• Don’t consume any food 5 hours before bed

• Take vitamin D3 while traveling

• Go to bed before midnight (around 10 pm works for many people)

## What steps should be taken if conventional acne treatments prove ineffective?

Let's say you've tried everything to get rid of acne, including the healthy version of keto and fasting, but you still have acne. What can you do? If you haven't tried healthy keto and fasting yet, this combination may be very beneficial to help clear up acne.

A spike in androgens, a spike in estrogen, or a spike in both of these hormones could be what's behind your acne. Stress is one thing that can spike androgens and cause acne. It's important to do what you can to lower your stress levels.

DHT is something that can trigger acne. A few potential remedies for acne in this situation are saw palmetto, stinging nettle root, or black cohosh. A spike in estrogen (estrogen dominance) can be behind acne, especially cystic acne. There is an enzyme called aromatase that converts testosterone into estrogen. A few potential natural remedies for acne in this situation are stinging nettle root, cruciferous vegetables, and DIM.

Your liver regulates excessive amounts of hormones, especially estrogen. There could be something going on creating a buffer. A powerful natural remedy for this situation is milk thistle. Of course, the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting may be beneficial too.

High levels of insulin can potentially cause acne and many other symptoms. Consuming a high-carb diet could cause high levels of insulin.

Dairy may also cause high estrogen. If you have a problem with acne, cutting out dairy may clear it up.

**Tips to get rid of acne:**

• Avoid dairy

• Avoid sugar and refined carbs

• Lower your stress

• Take certain herbs based on your situation

• Take zinc

• Take cod liver oil

• Avoid fluoride

## What steps should I take to manage an autoimmune disease, considering treatment options, lifestyle changes, and potential multidisciplinary care?

Autoimmune disease is a condition in which your body is attacking itself.

This means your immune system attacks your body’s own healthy tissues, similar to the body having an allergy to itself. Dr. Royal Lee was a famous nutritionist in the early 20th century. He discovered something known as PMG(proto morphogen), which worked to improve autoimmune disease symptoms.

Dr. Lee took the cells from another species’ thyroid and extracted the DNA using sea salt. He found that the DNA from this thyroid was very similar to ours.

If you consume the PMG (thyroid extract) orally and process it through your stomach, the antibodies that are attacking your thyroid will attack this decoy instead.

This allows you time to deplete the antibody reserve, so you no longer have any destructive attacks on your thyroid. If you have an autoimmune condition, PMGs or a glandular extract for a specific organ can help improve your symptoms over time.

***

## What strategies and interventions are most effective for improving respiratory function and optimizing breathing efficiency?

There’s something called the respiratory quotient, which is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO2) that happens in your body. Fat has the lowest RQ at .7, meaning you’ll get the lowest amount of CO2 but the most amount of oxygen. This is why a lot of people report that they’re breathing better on the ketogenic diet, even if they have COPD, asthma, or emphysema. Plus, they can go longer when they exercise.

Depending on the amount of ketones in your body, the RQ may even be a little lower; potentially as low as .66 then ranging to .73. Protein has a slightly higher RQ at .8. But check this out: carbs are 1.0, meaning they give off the most amount of C02 and the least amount of oxygen.

Now, that being said, I want to bring up the concept of ketoacidosis.

When your body is in an acidic state, you have a difficult time breathing. More CO2 than oxygen is being produced, but for a different reason than I described earlier in this video. If you're concerned about ketoacidosis, I’ll define what it is.

Not only does the pH drop by a slight degree, but your blood glucose will be very high; on the order of 300 or more. When you’re on the ketogenic diet and you’re not a diabetic, your blood sugars are going to be more like 80, 70, 0r 60. In other words, quite low. You’d have to be a diabetic type 1 for it to be as high as it would be in ketoacidosis.

And this situation of extremely high blood sugar occurs when you have no insulin going on. So you’d have to be a type 1 diabetic, who hadn’t taken their insulin, for your blood glucose to get so out of control. Add in a very high level of ketones plus acidic blood, and the dangerous condition of ketoacidosis will result. So I just want to clear this up because sometimes people are confused and concerned that ketoacidosis is a common risk on keto. It’s not.

Another type of acidosis is lactic acidosis; which, ironically, is a side effect of the diabetes drug metformin. If you experience this, take vitamin B1 and calcium.

To summarize, the keto diet has the benefit of generating less CO2 and more oxygen to help you breathe better.

## What strategies and interventions can help protect the brain from cognitive decline and support long-term cognitive health?

While estrogen's role in brain health is well-documented, progesterone also plays a crucial role in supporting cognitive function and neuroprotection.

Progesterone as a Neurosteroid

Progesterone, produced both in the ovaries and the brain, is a potent neurosteroid essential for cognitive health. It promotes neuronal growth and survival, particularly in regions like the hippocampus associated with memory and learning. By stimulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) production, progesterone aids in forming and strengthening neural pathways.

Additionally, progesterone's anti-inflammatory properties help mitigate brain inflammation linked to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, thus protecting against cognitive decline.

Broader Implications for Health

Beyond cognitive health, progesterone shows promise in other areas. Research indicates that it may reduce adverse effects from traumatic brain injury (TBI) and support recovery. Higher progesterone levels have been associated with fewer complications from TBI and lower rates of substance abuse, suggesting potential therapeutic benefits for brain injuries and addiction.

Maintaining balanced progesterone levels could thus enhance brain health and overall well-being, offering a valuable strategy for mitigating neurological conditions and improving treatment outcomes.

Addressing the underlying stress can be a valuable component in overcoming smoking addiction.

***

## What strategies and nutrients can effectively support the liver in metabolizing and eliminating alcohol?

There are various natural remedies that promote liver function and protect liver cells from the detrimental effects of acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolic by-product of alcohol detoxification. You can support alcohol detoxification by consuming a healthy diet rich in egg yolks, organ meats, green leafy vegetables, broccoli sprouts, and turmeric and taking liver-cleansing supplements, including milk thistle, CoQ10, and astaxanthin.

***

## What strategies can be employed to address adrenal fatigue through improved sleep management?

The medical profession doesn’t recognize adrenal fatigue as an actual condition. But, this doesn’t make sense. If a person has too much adrenal function, this is called Cushing’s disease, and if you don’t have enough adrenal hormones, this is called Addison’s disease. So, why couldn’t someone develop wear and tear, breakdown, or fatigue of the adrenal glands?

**The two big symptoms of adrenal fatigue are:**

1\. Chronic fatigue

2\. Chronic inflammation

The most important thing you can do for adrenal fatigue is to get more sleep. Sleep helps improve stress. It’s not always just about the diet. In this situation, it’s about recovering and restoring sleep.

**A few main causes of poor sleep:**

• Pain and inflammation (take vitamin D)

• Nightmares (take nutritional yeast)

• EMF

• A high pulse rate or high blood pressure (take potassium, magnesium, and vitamin D)

• Heart arrhythmias (Take potassium, magnesium, berberine, quinine, and forskolin)

**A few more things that may help:**

• Long walks

• Lower your carbohydrates

• Go to sleep when you’re tired

• Take naps

• Isolate what’s causing your stress and do what you can to improve your stress

## What strategies can be employed to address and combat glycine deficiency?

Glycine, a key amino acid, is vital for various bodily functions. While the body can produce some glycine, stress, poor diet, and certain medications can lead to deficiencies. Ensuring adequate intake through diet and supplementation is essential for maintaining optimal levels.

High-Glycine Foods

For those seeking to boost glycine levels through diet, consider incorporating the following foods:

\- Bone Broth: Rich in glycine from collagen.

\- Gelatin: Another excellent source.

\- Animal Skins: Pork and chicken skin.

\- Seafood: Provides glycine.

\- Vegetables: Spinach, kale, cauliflower.

\- Fruits: Bananas, kiwi.

Supplementation

Hydrolyzed collagen supplements offer a concentrated source of glycine and are highly bioavailable due to their breakdown into smaller peptides. Daily doses typically range from 3 to 5 grams, with some suggesting up to 10 grams for optimal benefits.

Safety and Recommendations

Glycine is generally safe, even at higher doses. Consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions.

***

## What strategies can be employed to alleviate symptoms of seasonal allergies?

Pollen allergies trigger histamine-driven immune reactions, causing symptoms like mucus production and fatigue. Gradual pollen exposure can desensitize the body. Bee pollen, rich in nutrients and anti-inflammatory properties, includes various local pollens.

**Benefits of Bee Pollen:**

\- Anti-inflammatory and wound-healing effects

\- Contains friendly microbes, amino acids, antioxidants, essential fatty acids, hormones, vitamins, and minerals

**How to Use Bee Pollen:**

Start with 2-3 grains daily, increasing gradually over a week. Adults can eventually take 2-5 teaspoons daily, children 1-2 teaspoons. Chew, grind, or soak in water.

**Other Natural Allergy Remedies:**

Include quercetin, onions, and stinging nettle. Support liver health during allergy seasons.

Initiate the pollen exposure protocol before spring, repeating 2-3 times yearly for best results.

***

## What strategies can be employed to effectively stimulate and enhance the process of autophagy for optimal cellular health and longevity?

Autophagy means “self-eat.” This is the state in which your body begins to recycle damaged proteins and pathogens.

When proteins become damaged, they can wreak havoc on your body. To prevent this harm, your body breaks down damaged proteins with enzymes and creates new healthy proteins.

There are several ways you can promote autophagy naturally:

1\. Fasting - Fasting is a fantastic way to induce autophagy. It’s my opinion that fasting for 16-18 hours is ideal for autophagy—although few studies show an exact length of time for peak autophagy.

2\. Exercise - Exercise is another excellent way to promote autophagy.

3\. Coffee - Drinking coffee may help induce autophagy to some degree. I don’t recommend having much more than one cup of coffee each day. Way too much caffeine will affect your sleep, which can actually reduce autophagy.

4\. Sulforaphane - This compound is a phytochemical that has health-protecting effects, including the ability to induce autophagy. You can get sulforaphane from fresh cruciferous vegetables or cruciferous supplements. You should be consuming plenty of vegetables (7-10 cups) every day.

5\. Green tea (EGCG) - EGCG, or epigallocatechin gallate, is a powerful autophagy-inducing compound found in green tea. Additionally, EGCG is great for reducing inflammation and fighting off cancer cells.

6\. Curcumin - Curcumin is a potent autophagy-promoting compound found in turmeric. Turmeric is often found in Indian foods like curry.

7\. Resveratrol - This compound is primarily found in the skin of black grapes and red wine. Resveratrol has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and autophagy-promoting properties.

## What strategies can be employed to facilitate the restoration and regeneration of bone tissue?

Osteoporosis is a loss of bone density and bone mass. This increases your risk of fractures. Osteopenia is the stage that occurs just before osteoporosis. It’s been found that people with osteoporosis have a much higher degree of calcification in the arteries and joints. This means a person has excess calcium, but it’s not going to the right places in the body. When dealing with osteoporosis and osteopenia, we can’t just look at a loss of calcium. We also need to consider vitamin K2 deficiency and vitamin D3 deficiency.

Vitamin D3 supports calcium absorption, and vitamin K2 helps drive calcium into the bones. If you take vitamin K2 as a supplement, it may be best to take the natural form called MK7. Vitamin A (retinol) is another important vitamin to support healthy bones. These essential vitamins for osteoporosis are all fat-soluble, which means supporting your gallbladder and liver is crucial. Bile salts can help support the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients if you have a gallbladder or liver problem. It’s also essential to have strong acid in the stomach to absorb minerals and trace minerals.

I would still take some form of calcium if I had osteoporosis. But I would also take these other nutrients. I would also avoid calcium carbonate, which is less bioavailable than other forms. Try to get your calcium and other nutrients from food.

**Other important minerals and trace minerals for strong bones:**

• Magnesium

• Potassium

• Zinc

• Copper

• Boron

Be sure you’re also consuming high-quality sources of protein and are exercising consistently to help with osteoporosis and osteopenia.

***

## What strategies can be employed to mitigate the potentially adverse effects associated with elevated levels of vitamin D?

Vitamin D helps absorb the calcium in the blood by 20x. The only toxic effect of vitamin D has to do with too much calcium in the blood.

**Hypercalcemia Symptoms**

• Constipation

• Kidney Stones

• Frequent Urination

• Dementia

• Depression

• Ulcers

• Abdominal Pain

**Recommendation:**

1\. Vitamin K2 (MK7 version) – it triggers the protein that could signal the calcium to go into the bone. Ratio: For every 10,000IUs of D3 – 100mcg of K2

2\. Avoid Dairy

## What strategies can effectively reduce elevated ammonia levels in individuals with liver cirrhosis?

Ammonia is a byproduct of protein metabolism. Normally, in the digestive tract you break down protein from the stomach that turns into amino acids that are supposed to go through the liver and there are certain byproducts that occur with those amino acids; ammonia and urea. Urea is the less toxic form of ammonia.

**Symptoms of Ammonia**

• Confusion

• Mood Changes

• Personality Changes

• Nerve Damage / Brain Dysfunction

• Comma (Possible)

**Possible Reasons Why Ammonia Buildup in the Body**

1\. Cirrhosis (Scar tissue of the liver)

2\. Hepatitis

3\. Alcohol

4\. Carnitine Deficiency – Carnitine is a protein that is carrier-like that delivers to the mitochondria for energy. So if you have a carnitine deficiency, you can build up too much ammonia.

5\. Dehydration

6\. SIBO – Too much bacteria growing in the small intestine and not in the large.

**What Things You Can Do?**

1\. Start cutting down protein.

2\. Take glutamine (L-glutamine)

3\. High potassium foods (Vegetables)

4\. Chlorophyll (Wheatgrass juice powder)

5\. Probiotics 6. Garlic

7\. Cruciferous

8\. Apple Cider Vinegar

9\. Celery / Celery Juice

## What strategies can effectively remove kidney stones and excess oxalates to improve kidney function and health?

**Signs your oxalate levels are high:**

• Kidney stones

• Gout

• Headaches

• Eye pain

• Urinary pain

• Genital pain

• Muscle pain

• Intestinal pain

**Foods high in oxalates:**

• Almonds

• Peanuts

• Spinach

• Chocolate

• Kiwi

• Strawberries

• Beets

• Tea

• Bran

Dietary oxalates aren’t correlated with oxalates in your urine. Just because you consume foods high in oxalates doesn’t mean you will develop any problems. But, preexisting damage to your kidneys, liver, or metabolism can cause you to be unable to process oxalates like you should. Diabetes, prediabetes, insulin resistance, and carb consumption can lead to kidney problems. A lack of certain microbes can also prevent you from breaking down oxalates, causing them to end up in the kidneys. Many people who go on the ketogenic diet no longer have a problem dealing with oxalates. But if you’re still experiencing issues, you can try these tips.

**What to do if you have high oxalate levels or are prone to kidney stones:**

1\. Limit foods high in oxalates or consume them with cheese

2\. Take a probiotic with a mixture of lactobacillus

3\. Maintain higher levels of magnesium and citrates (by consuming magnesium and lemon)

4\. Get plenty of vitamin D

5\. Drink at least two and a half liters of fluid a day

## What strategies can ensure sufficient potassium intake on a carnivore diet, given its inherent dietary restrictions?

You need 4700 mg of potassium each day, more than any other mineral.

Potassium is important for the sodium-potassium pump present in all of your cells, which allows the contraction and relaxation of your nerves.

Too much potassium is known as hyperkalemia, and too little is known as hypokalemia. Symptoms of high potassium include diarrhea, muscle pain, and muscle numbness. Symptoms of low potassium include constipation, muscle cramps, and fatigue.

Potassium is vital for exercise performance. If you don’t have enough, you’ll probably feel weak or tired. One of the causes of low potassium is low magnesium.

Kidney disease can cause high potassium. If the kidney is not functioning properly, it won’t be able to get rid of potassium. It’s very rare to develop too much potassium in the blood from dietary intake.

Blood pressure medications or side effects of an adrenal condition known as Addison's can also cause high potassium.

Diuretics and steroids can cause low potassium. Surgeries and injuries can also cause low potassium.

The following vegetables are some of the best sources of potassium:

•1 cup of beet leaves 1300 mg

•1 cup of Swiss chard 900 mg

•1 cup spinach 840 mg

•1 avocado 500-700 mg

•1 cup of beets 520 mg

•1 cup of salad 350-500 mg

Bananas contain around 300 mg of potassium but have too much sugar.

Here are some of the best sources of potassium on the carnivore diet:

•1 cup of bone broth 500 mg

•3 ½ oz beef 350 mg

•3 ½ oz octopus 650 mg

•3 oz salmon 300 mg

•1 large egg 63 mg

•3 oz beef liver 125 mg

•3 oz chicken 300 mg

## What strategies can help address the hardening of heart walls, including lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, and medical treatments?

**If anything could actually extend the longevity of your heart it's the combination of keto and intermittent fasting and doing it healthily. The heart muscle and the inside of the arteries of your heart respond best to vitamin E.** So you should get something called tocotrienols which will immediately help any type of inflammation going on in those areas of your body. Your heart also will carry more oxygen, the heart muscle itself if it has enough vitamin E.

If we're talking about hardening of the arteries, we want to keep things elastic. And with aging, of course, you have more hardening. So there's a couple of things that I would focus on. **First is consuming the high potassium diet on this keto. The potassium and magnesium are going to make your arteries more flexible for sure. And being on a low carb is going to reduce any type of inflammatory condition because it's really all about inflammation that the body then responds as a band-aid and make things really stiff.**

There's some other things you can do to support the heart. Vitamin B3, like niacin with that flush. Also make sure you get enough sleep. And then the one last thing I would recommend is that I wouldn't be afraid of fatty foods. I'd be afraid of carbs because the fatty foods you'll have a lot of vitamin K2 which can help to decalcify the arteries if there is calcium in it.

## What strategies can help balance Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids in the diet, and why is this balance important for overall health?

The omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is way off in the average diet. The average American is at a 20:1 and sometimes a 70:1 or more omega-6 to omega-3 ratio!

**We need both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, but we need significantly more omega-3 fatty acids to avoid inflammation.** The source is important! You don’t want to get your omega-6 fatty acids from seed oils.

Omega-6 consumption from seed oils directly correlates with chronic illnesses like heart disease. Very recently in human history, seed oils replaced saturated fat in the diet and are in every ultra-processed food. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids include fatty fish, cod liver oil, cod liver, sardines, and shellfish.

**Grain-fed animals are much higher in omega-6 fatty acids. This is one of the reasons people are turning to grass-fed, grass-finished beef.**

Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids go through the same biochemical pathways and compete with each other in the body. If there’s any problem in these biochemical pathways, you can end up with dysfunctional fats that your body will be unable to benefit from.

Co-factors for these biochemical pathways include magnesium, vitamins B2, B3, B6, vitamin C, and insulin. Many people are insulin resistant, which means they’re deficient in insulin. Seed oil consumption paired with insulin resistance causes a lot more compound damage.

**Intermittent fasting and a low-carb diet can correct insulin resistance so you’re better able to utilize fatty acids within the body and don’t end up with dysfunctional fats.**

Omega-3 fatty acids fall into two categories: DHA and EPA. EPA helps reduce inflammation, and DHA helps support cognitive function. ALA is a precursor to EPA.

There’s a simple blood test that can measure your omega-3 to omega-6 ratio.

## What strategies can help facilitate sleep when overtired, and how do they address hyperarousal and fatigue-induced insomnia?

Create a soothing sleep environment and find relaxing techniques that work for you to calm an overstimulated and exhausted nervous system.

***

## What strategies can help induce sleep when experiencing insomnia, and how do behavioral and environmental changes contribute to restful slumber?

Forcing yourself to fall asleep can be counterproductive, as trying too hard to fall asleep can increase stress and anxiety and make it even more challenging to relax.

***

## What strategies can help protect yourself from common winter illnesses and boost your immune system during the colder months?

75% of infections are viral, the vitamin D can reduce viral infection up to 50% and when you consume vitamin D, always consume vitamin D3. Taking 20,000 IUs will greatly improve cold sores. Vitamin D deficiency will increase the susceptibility to viruses and make you more susceptible.

**Vitamin D Benefits:**

• Improves autoimmune conditions

• Hormone precursor – almost considered as a hormone and also a precursor to cortisol (stress hormone)

• Broad Spectrum Antibiotic (Natural) \*also add: zinc, vitamin A and selenium

***

## What strategies can I employ to effectively extricate myself from any stressful situation and regain composure?

This simple stress-release technique works fast, is free, and has many health benefits. It will help balance the parasympathetic nervous system, which is all about “rest and digest.” This easy breathing technique is based on a book called Heart Coherence 365.

**What you need to remember is 365, which stands for:**

• 3 times a day

• 6 breaths per minute

• 5 minutes

Three times a day, you’re going to take six breaths per minute for five minutes. It’s important to make sure you take deep, even breaths through your nose using your stomach. You should feel your diaphragm going out and in. This breathing technique for stress can also help improve HRV (heart rate variability). HRV has a lot to do with your health and fitness reserves. An HRV (heart rate variability) device can help you better understand and improve your health and nervous system balance.

***

## What strategies can I employ to enhance the diversity of my gut microbiome, including dietary adjustments, lifestyle changes, and probiotic or prebiotic supplementation?

Ideally, you want a rich microbiome with a lot of different species. Without this diversity, you’ll provide the perfect space for harmful bacteria to thrive.

This lack of diversity is called dysbiosis, and it’s associated with many different serious health conditions.

**How to increase the diversity of microbes in your gut and boost your health:**

1\. Consume food that has been grown on soil that has a diverse microbiome

2\. Increase the diversity of plant foods in your diet

3\. Exercise

4\. Get plenty of quality sleep

5\. Do intermittent fasting

6\. Consume phenols

7\. Consume sprouts or microgreens grown on soil

8\. Consume probiotic foods

9\. Consume raw foods

***

## What strategies improve probiotic survival in the stomach and boost their effectiveness in digestion?

Probiotics are microbes. Microbes are a crucial part of our world. They convert carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur into forms that living things can use. We have ten times more microbes living on and inside our bodies than we have cells.

Strong hydrochloric acid in the stomach can kill a good portion of microbes. Bile salts also affect the microbiome. But, some microbes are resilient and can even live without oxygen.

How to support the survival of probiotics in the stomach:

1\. Take a probiotic supplement or consume probiotic foods at the end of your meal

2\. Consume probiotics earlier in the day

3\. If fasting, drink more water with your probiotics

4\. Don’t take probiotics with lemon water or apple cider vinegar water

5\. Consume raw plants grown in soil

## What strategies or interventions can assist someone struggling with excessive carbohydrate consumption?

Carboholic is someone that is addicted to carbohydrates. This is a physical problem and a cellular level where the body is driving you to not think about the future consequences, logically it doesn’t help you to understand that.

Insulin is the hormone that allows the sugar fuel into the cell, which could lead to insulin resistance where the insulin doesn’t work anymore and that makes your body crave sugar.

Every time you consume sugar there is a spike of beta-endorphins, which is the chemicals in the body that are 30x stronger than morphine for pain and stress.

Dopamine which is a pleasure hormone that is stimulated when you take drugs is also triggered when you consume a lot of sugar and carbohydrates.

**The difference between addiction and a habit:**

• Addiction: Completely out of control and cannot say no. The more you can’t have it, the more you want it.

• Habit: Something that you can say no to. It is just like a routine you get into.

**Ways to Overcome Addiction to Carbs:**

1\. Understand what is happening in the body

2\. Heal insulin resistance

3\. Do things gradually: Start consuming keto bombs (sweet cookies that do not affect insulin)

4\. Start consuming a lot of nutrients – It is the nutrients that protect the cell against high levels of sugar

## What strategies or practices are most effective for enhancing learning and cognitive performance?

**It all starts with the hippocampus.** Your hippocampus is the structure in your brain that has to do with learning and spatial memory. The omega-3 fatty acid called DHA makes up 20% of your brain’s grey matter (including your hippocampus).

**DHA also helps…**

• Support your retina

• Lower oxidative stress/acts as an antioxidant

• Reduce inflammation

• Increase BDNF (this helps your brain grow)

• Boost the volume of the hippocampus

As you age, the structure of your hippocampus shrinks. In turn, this can affect your ability to learn and maintain spatial memory. If you’re DHA deficient, your hippocampus will get even smaller. Taking omega-3 fatty acids can greatly benefit the hippocampus and improve your ability to learn. DHA is involved with the synapses—these allow communication between neurons. Low levels of DHA can even cause ADHD and dyslexia. The brain and retinas depend on DHA.

**If an infant is not breastfed, the makeup of their retina may be abnormal due to low levels of DHA. In fact, DHA can even influence a child’s IQ.**

**The best sources of DHA are:**

• Fatty fish

• Cod liver oil

• Algae

## What strategies or substances can effectively enhance insulin sensitivity?

To understand insulin sensitivity, you need to understand insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a situation where the receptor for insulin in your cells is blocking insulin. It’s not allowing insulin to go into the cells. You don’t have the function that insulin should have normally. Because of this, the body starts putting out more insulin.

Insulin is very important to help regulate the blood sugars and to help with the absorption of nutrients. But, the more insulin resistance you have, the more insulin you’re going to have, and the more problems you’re going to have. For example, in the presence of insulin, you can’t lose weight.

We want to improve insulin resistance by making insulin more sensitive.

**Help improve insulin sensitivity naturally by doing these things:**

1\. Resistance training

2\. Fasting

3\. Decrease inflammation

4\. Reduce glucose (do healthy keto)

5\. Increase sleep

6\. Decrease stress (cortisol)

7\. Consume more vegetables (fiber)

**A few additional things to help increase insulin sensitivity:**

• Apple cider vinegar

• Cinnamon

• Omega 3

• Vitamin D

## What stretching exercises are best for relieving stiffness, and how do they improve flexibility and range of motion?

Many of us have been taught to stretch by holding a position for 30 to 60 seconds—this is called static stretching. But this is the worst way to stretch your muscles. Tight muscles are weaker and are more susceptible to injury and inflammation. When you stretch incorrectly, you can easily strain or pull a muscle. Motion is all about the coordination of contraction and relaxation of the muscles. One of the best ways to stretch is a method from a book called The Whartons’ Complete Strength Book, and it’s called Active Isolated Flexibility.

**How to stretch correctly (using Active Isolated Flexibility):**

1\. Identify the muscle you want to stretch

2\. Contract or tighten the opposite muscle as you stretch

3\. Stretch to a comfortable limit and hold for two seconds and then relax

Repeat this method of stretching eight to ten times per muscle. This would be a great warm-up before you exercise. You may also want to consider a version of this as part of the rehab process for a less severe injury.

## What supplements and natural strategies can be used to help manage depression and bipolar disorder without the use of medication, and how effective are these approaches?

To combat depression and bipolar disorder naturally, consider these steps:

1\. **Diet and Fasting:** Start with a healthy ketogenic diet combined with intermittent fasting. This foundational change can significantly improve your mood and overall well-being.

2\. **Targeted Nutrients:** Once your diet is optimized, supplement with higher amounts of vitamin D, which has been shown to support mental health.

Addressing nutrient deficiencies without first improving your diet may not be effective, so prioritize dietary changes and then adjust with specific supplements as needed.

_**We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**_

## What supplements are recommended for supporting skin health in individuals with vitiligo, and how do they contribute to the management of this condition?

Vitiligo is a depigmentation problem. You lose your skin pigment in certain areas of your body. The cells in control of the skin pigment—known as melanocytes—have stopped functioning properly.

This condition is often associated with autoimmunity. Those with vitiligo may have other autoimmune conditions. Vitiligo is associated with a large amount of free radical damage. ROS and hydrogen peroxide cause a lot of oxidation.

Zinc and copper are involved in a very powerful antioxidant called SOD (superoxide dismutase).

Light therapy may be used to combat vitiligo. A pilot study showed that when vitiligo patients take 35,000 IUs of vitamin D, 14 out of 16 see significant repigmentation.

**There are three supplements you can take for vitiligo:**

1\. Zinc - 100 mg

2\. Vitamin D - 35,000 IUs

3\. Copper - 1500 mcg

**Fasting may also benefit those with vitiligo since it’s related to autoimmunity.**

## What techniques can quickly reduce blood pressure, and how do they help regulate hypertension?

High blood pressure, a prevalent condition, can significantly impact your overall health. Grasping its intricacies is key to effective management. Let's delve into the causes and strategies to control blood pressure levels.

Your autonomic nervous system plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure. Stress can trigger an increase, leading to elevated systolic and diastolic readings, indicating the force exerted by your heart during and between beats.

Controlled breathing exercises offer a natural way to manage blood pressure. The "5-Second Breath Rule," involving slow and deliberate inhales and exhales, signals your autonomic nervous system to relax, potentially reducing blood pressure.

Incorporating breathing exercises into your bedtime routine can enhance sleep quality. Consistent practice fosters relaxation and promotes better rest, ultimately contributing to blood pressure management.

Beyond breathing, lifestyle changes are pivotal. A balanced diet low in salt and rich in whole foods, coupled with regular physical activity, can significantly impact blood pressure regulation. Dietary approaches like keto and intermittent fasting may also aid in managing hypertension.

Additionally, turmeric, known for its anti-inflammatory properties, has shown potential in lowering blood pressure. Its active compound, curcumin, may influence blood pressure regulation.

By understanding the causes of high blood pressure and adopting a holistic approach encompassing breathing exercises, dietary adjustments, physical activity, and lifestyle changes, you can empower yourself to achieve better blood pressure control and overall well-being.

## What to do for Alzheimer's Disease if nothing is working?

Interestingly, smoking cigarettes and ibuprofen reduce LH and Alzheimer's risk. Now, I'm definitely not saying you should start taking ibuprofen and smoking cigarettes to prevent AD.

The drug Lupron—which is used for endometriosis, fibroids, prostate cancer, and breast cancer—also decreases the risk of Alzheimer's. Lupron also happens to lower LH. However, Lupron has numerous adverse side effects.

There is one drug without side effects that can also decrease LH: melatonin. Melatonin is stimulated by darkness, and it helps you get into a deep sleep. It also helps stimulate your immune system and offers powerful antioxidant properties.

Melatonin has significant effects when it comes to reducing Alzheimer's risk in women. Men can also see some benefits when taking much larger amounts of melatonin.

Here is what the book recommends for reducing Alzheimer's risk.

* Females: 75mg of melatonin per day
* Males: 120 mg of melatonin per day
* 300mg pregnenolone
* 3tsp MCT oil
* Regular exercise
* Fasting

Always check with your doctor before applying any of this information. This is just to educate you on these interesting links between hormones and Alzheimer's disease.

## What treatments or interventions are most effective for managing and alleviating facial neuropathy?

**This little nerve bundle called the ganglion,** it could be a viral latency is called a virus that kind of comes out in remission back and forth that can then stir up inflammation on that nerve. There's a couple of things that I would do.

**Number one, I would massage on the left side, the opposite side.** I don't know if you tried that yet exactly where it originates from and you press on the mirror image that may help you a little bit.

**The other thing that I would recommend in case there was some related dental work,** you need to find a dentist that specializes in how the teeth actually close to make sure that they're perfectly closing. Because I'll tell you if that one tooth is just a little bit higher or a little lower, it can affect the entire jaw, the neck, the nerve.

**The other situation is there, if they did a root canal, there could be a deeper infection, which is really hard to find sometimes.** And for example, when they do an extra, they can see certain types of bone loss underneath the tooth because there's an infection there deep in the tooth that can literally keep that thing active.

## What type of diet is beneficial for someone experiencing pulsatile tinnitus, and how might dietary choices impact symptoms and overall management?

Pulsatile tinnitus may be linked to potassium deficiency, often exacerbated by a ketogenic diet due to water and glycogen loss. To address this, ensure adequate potassium intake—about 4,700 mg daily—by incorporating potassium-rich foods like meats and salads. Additionally, complement your diet with B vitamins and electrolytes to support overall health and alleviate symptoms.

## What type of yogurt does Dr. Berg recommend, and what are the key characteristics or qualities that make it a preferred choice for health benefits?

**Trimona is a type of yogurt that I think is very special.**

A few reasons why I like Trimona:

• It’s grass-fed

• They use cows that generate A2 protein versus A1 (less allergies)

• It’s organic

• It’s whole fat

• It’s fermented for 30 hours

• It’s non-strained

• There are no thickeners or additives

• It’s plain

• It’s non-GMO

**Trimona has:**

• 10g of carbs

• 6g of sugar

• 8g of protein

• 8g of fat

**Trimona also has friendly bacteria, including lactobacillus bulgaricus. A few potential benefits of lactobacillus bulgaricus:**

• Could help improve lactose intolerance

• Stimulates the immune system

• Supports the liver

• Could help decrease diarrhea

• Could help decrease inflammation in the gut

• Could help decrease constipation

The pH of this yogurt is more acidic than other products out there. Also, because it’s grass-fed, it’s going to have higher amounts of a certain type of fat called CLA. Even though it’s an omega 6 fatty acid, it doesn’t create inflammation. It may actually help the immune system, help build muscle, and even help promote weight loss. This product also has a good amount of omega 3 fatty acids, vitamin A, and even vitamin K2.

## What viral health tips should I not try?

1\. Ear candling - This treatment has been debunked by a doctor of audiology! There is absolutely no difference in ear wax before and after ear candling.

2\. Gallbladder flush - This almost killed me! A gallbladder flush involves drinking 12 ounces of olive oil followed by beet tablets to eliminate gallstones. This really eliminates bile, causing you to become deficient. TUDCA is a much better remedy to help prevent and eliminate gallstones and bile sludge.

3\. The master cleanse - This cleanse combines lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and maple syrup, which won’t cleanse your body but will mess with your blood sugar.

4\. Foot detox pads - You can not pull toxins and heavy metals out of your feet as there are no detox pathways through the skin.

5\. Foot detox bath - Similar to foot detox pads, a chemical reaction changes the water's color during a foot detox bath, leading you to believe it’s pulling toxins out of your body.

6\. Ab belts - Stimulating the stomach muscles or sweating will not remove fat from your midsection. Visceral fat must be removed through diet and exercise.

7\. The blood type diet - This diet is not supported by credible research. Blood types relate more to an immune difference rather than a digestive difference.

8\. EMF blockers - A sticker on your cell phone can not block the EMF radiation it omits.

9\. Carb blockers - Carb blockers contain an extract that can inhibit the digestion of a minimal amount of starch, not sugar. You would need to take several bottles to inhibit the digestion of the starch from one donut.

10\. Psychiatric medication - The effectiveness of psychiatric medication can be comparable to placebo outcomes. They may also come with serious side effects and can be highly addictive.

## What will happen if you take Omega-3 fish oil for a month?

Both cod liver oil and fish oil contain omega-3 fatty acids, with the addition of vitamin A and vitamin D in cod liver oil. Around 25% of the fat in your brain is the omega-3 fatty acid, DHA. Most of this fat is in the frontal cortex, which supports memory, focus, concentration, and attention. DHA supports the integrity of the membranes around the neurons and supports the retina. It also protects against inflammation, UV radiation, and macular degeneration.

Omega-3 fatty acids keep skin smooth and protect against acne, psoriasis, eczema, dry skin, red skin, and ultraviolet light. They can also help remineralize bone, decrease the risk of osteoporosis, and improve arthritis and joint inflammation.

Taking cod liver oil or fish oil for 30 days has even more potential benefits, including the following:

•Supports liver health

•Helps regulate blood sugar

•Helps reverse insulin resistance

•Supports inside of the arteries

•Reduces symptoms of asthma and allergies

•Supports fertility

•Helps eliminate soreness and inflammation after exercise

Avoid choosing fish oil based on price alone. Some fish oils are poor quality and may be rancid or oxidized. Know the source of your fish oil to avoid getting a product contaminated with heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, or mercury. Fish oil and cod liver oil may taste like fish, but they shouldn’t have a rancid taste. To minimize the taste, try looking for supplements in pearl form. Omega-3 foods include fatty fish such as wild-caught salmon, herring, mackerel, and sardines. Shellfish and grass-fed dairy products also contain omega-3 fatty acids.

## What's the #1 best food for brain?

It’s a misconception that the brain can't regenerate—certain parts of the brain can regrow.

**The top foods to avoid to support a healthy brain are:**

1\. Omega-6 fatty acids (soy oil, corn oil, canola oil, and cottonseed oil)

2\. Sugar

3\. Refined carbs

The best food to support brain health is wild-caught salmon.

**Wild-caught salmon can help enhance the brain in many ways, including supporting:**

• Memory

• Focus

• Thinking

• Problem-solving

• Learning

It may also be beneficial for those with mood disorders or brain inflammation. Consuming more wild-caught salmon may even help reduce insulin resistance, which is at the core of many brain problems. The brain is the fattiest organ in the body. Omega-3 fatty acids are the healthy fats your brain needs. They’re the building blocks of your brain. Wild-caught salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids.

Wild-caught salmon is keto-friendly. It’s low-carb and has a good amount of protein and nutrients. But, to get these incredible benefits for the brain, be sure the salmon you choose is wild-caught and not farm-raised. Try having your salmon with a kale salad topped with olive oil and unfortified nutritional yeast to take your brain health to the next level.

## What's the best fibroid shrinking vitamin?

Fibroids decrease in size after menopause, yet pregnancy, exposure to HRT, and birth control pills can cause fibroids to enlarge. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and PCOS also increase the risk of fibroids. Black women have a 3 to 9 times higher risk of developing fibroids. Estrogen is the primary driver of fibroids and endometriosis. A fibroid is a growth in the uterus, but it differs from uterine tissue in several ways. Fibroids are very sensitive to estrogen and have increased estrogen receptors, more of the enzyme aromatase, less oxygen than the uterus, and more inflammation.

Many health problems and risk factors associated with fibroids are related to low vitamin D. Vitamin D has incredible properties that may help inhibit the growth of fibroids. There is also a vast amount of anecdotal evidence in support of using vitamin D to shrink fibroids. Be sure to take vitamin D with the cofactors magnesium and vitamin K2.

## What's the best meal to clean arteries and keep them plaque-free?

The endothelial layer is the innermost layer of your arteries. It controls blood pressure, acts as a filter, prevents clots, and supports immune function. The inside of your arteries is very susceptible to problems with insulin. Most people have insulin resistance, which is caused by chronic carbohydrate consumption and constant snacking.

Nitric oxide relaxes the blood vessels and is vital for the health of the endothelial layer of the arteries. Vitamin D triggers nitric oxide, which is why many people who are low in vitamin D also have high blood pressure. Arginine, testosterone, and magnesium also trigger nitric oxide.

Vitamin D and magnesium can help prevent calcium from building up in the arteries, and vitamin K2 also helps to prevent calcium buildup.

Foods like whole grains and seed oils are deemed “heart healthy,” but they spike insulin. We’re also told to avoid saturated fats because of the cholesterol content. There’s a lot of false information regarding a diet that’s truly healthy for your heart.

The best meal to clean your arteries would involve foods that don’t spike insulin. A low-carb ketogenic diet is best for your heart. The primary part of the best meal to clean out your arteries should be grass-fed red meat. If you’re having a burger, melt raw cheese on top because it’s high in vitamin K2. Red meat is loaded with zinc, which can directly improve your testosterone. Include a salad with your meal. Arugula is a great addition to any salad, as it can increase nitric oxide and is rich in vitamins C and E. Pumpkin seeds are also beneficial due to their high magnesium, zinc, and selenium content. Vitamin D3 is vital for a healthy heart. Sunlight is the best source, but you may need to take a supplement in the winter. Take at least 10,000 IU daily as a maintenance dose.

***

## What's the best probiotic for an autoimmune condition?

An autoimmune disease is a condition in which the immune system attacks its own tissues. It is typically characterized by low regulatory T-cells and high Th17 and Th2 cells. T-reg cells prevent autoimmune diseases by supporting an appropriate immune response. There are natural ways to support your immune system so that it operates at an optimal level. Poor gut health and gut inflammation can block the function of vitamin D3. Without enough vitamin D, T-reg cells do not work properly.

The majority of the population is vitamin D-resistant. To support the immune system, you need 8,000 to 10,000 IU of vitamin D daily, but even more to overcome resistance. Poor gut health, inflammation, and low vitamin D are a perfect storm for developing an autoimmune condition.

B. infantis and L. reuteri are vital for your immune system, but many people don’t have them because these probiotics are very sensitive to antibiotics. These two important microbes help prevent autoimmune diseases, greatly affect T-reg cells, and suppress inflammatory immune cells.

L. reuteri helps increase oxytocin, one of the most potent anti-stress hormones. High cortisol levels mean high stress, which suppresses the immune system. The best way to consume l. reuteri is to cultivate it in a dairy product.

If you’re low in selenium, you will have higher amounts of inflammatory immune cells. Selenium helps lower Th17, Th2 cells, and auto-antibodies involved in autoimmune disorders. Prolonged fasting can improve your immune system by increasing T-reg cells and creating new stem cells.

## What's the important purpose of magnesium?

Magnesium is needed in a lot of different functions in the body, but its primary purpose is to act as a calcium antagonist. Calcium is very toxic in the body unless it’s in normal amounts. Taking 500mg or more of calcium per day could potentially increase your risk of a heart attack or stroke.

Calcium is essential, but we need it in smaller amounts. Calcium doesn’t exit the body very easily. There are even many different disease processes out there that involve the accumulation of calcium. Magnesium is the key mineral to help prevent this.

Hypercalcemia is a condition where there is too much calcium in the blood.

Symptoms of hypercalcemia:

• Arrhythmias

• Abdominal pain

• Paralytic ileus

• Vomiting

• Excessive or reduced urination

• Psychosis

• Strong desire for sleep

• Constipation

## What's the most important electrolyte?

Your heart, your fluid, your energy, and your nutrients in and out of the cell is dependent on the sodium and potassium pump. However, potassium is the most difficult to get from the diet. High levels of cortisol (stress), insulin, sugar, diuretics, excessive salt, and surgery, all can deplete potassium. However, you need between 7-10 cups of salad or veggies to get your daily requirement of 4700mg.

## What's the most workable remedy to drain sinuses?

Keep in mind that a high-carb diet can feed the microbes that cause sinus problems. Natural remedies can help provide relief, but unless you change your diet, your sinus problems could come back.

**The top natural remedies to drain your sinuses:**

1\. Spanish black radish

• You can consume these throughout the day or take them as a supplement. If you take them as a supplement, you can take three every hour for eight hours.

2\. Black seed oil

• Take this on a regular basis. Consider tripling the regular dosage.

3\. Kimchi juice

• Put a tiny amount of the juice on your finger and apply it to the inside of the nostrils, no more than 1/4 inch deep.

4\. Do a nasal rinse with saline solution and colloidal silver

• Get a nasal rinse kit and pour out some of the saline solution. Mix 1/4 teaspoon of colloidal silver into 1/2 cup water and add the mixture to the saline solution.

## What's the one vitamin that reverses nerve damage?

Viruses can hide in the ganglia (a nerve cell cluster) and turn off autophagy, a state in which the body recycles damaged proteins. Here, the viruses can lie dormant until stress levels rise, which increases cortisol and weakens the immune system. Emotional stress can significantly weaken the immune system. This is why many dormant viruses come out of remission after a stressful event, such as losing a loved one.

The herpes and shingles viruses are often seen after a significant stressor. These viruses need the amino acid arginine to survive. Lysine can block arginine and stop the reproduction of these viruses. You need at least 1000 to 3000 mg of lysine to block arginine.

Sciatica typically stems from a disc problem. Copper deficiency is at the root of many disc problems, so it can be an excellent solution for sciatica. A copper supplement or copper cream can help reduce sciatica pain.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is usually caused by a vitamin B6 deficiency. Along with increasing vitamin B6, you also need more vitamin B12 to support the myelin sheaths of your nerves.

Adequate vitamin D3 is vital for conditions like multiple sclerosis and helps reduce inflammation within the nerve cells. To put conditions like MS into remission, you need to take large amounts of vitamin D3—at least 50,000 IU.

The Coimbra Protocol is a well-researched method of using high doses of vitamin D3 to effectively reduce the symptoms of autoimmune conditions. Many people with diabetes develop a condition called peripheral neuropathy that causes numbness in the toes and feet. Vitamin B1 in the form of benfotiamine can penetrate the myelin sheath and help reverse nerve damage caused by high blood sugar. For vitamin B1 to work, you need the cofactor magnesium.

***

## When do I avoid consuming large amounts of magnesium?

This is when to avoid consuming large amounts of magnesium:

* If you have kidney disease (chronic kidney disease, diabetic nephropathy, you’re on dialysis, or if you see low GFR on your kidney test)
* If you have hypothyroidism
* If you have Addison’s disease
* If you’re taking certain medications like Fosamax, certain antibiotics, diuretics or lithium

***

## When is the best time to take vitamin D?

If you have a sleep problem, you may want to try taking your vitamin D before bed. Vitamin D may help increase your non-REM sleep. This is the deep delta wave sleep that occurs in the first half of sleep. Vitamin D may also help reduce your cortisol (stress) levels.

Most people will sleep fine, if not better, when they take vitamin D before bed. However, a small percentage of people may find that taking vitamin D before bed wakes them up. These people may need to take vitamin D earlier in the day.

Other great vitamins for sleep problems:

* Vitamin B5
* Folate
* Vitamin B1 (especially if you can’t turn your brain off at night)

***

## When is the optimal time to take Magnesium Glycinate to maximize its potential benefits for improving sleep quality?

Magnesium Glycinate can help with sleep if taken 30 minutes before bed.

***

## When is the optimal time to take probiotics to maximize their effectiveness?

Probiotics are microbes. Microbes are a crucial part of our world. They convert carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur into forms that living things can use. We have ten times more microbes living on and inside our bodies than we have cells.

**Microbes have many functions and help us in various ways, including:**

• Helping to make nutrients available

• Providing immune protection

• Protecting against pathogens

• Supporting detoxification

• Improving digestion

• Helping to make vitamins

Strong hydrochloric acid in the stomach can kill a good portion of microbes. Bile salts also affect the microbiome. But, some microbes are resilient and can even live without oxygen.

**How to support the survival of probiotics in the stomach:**

1\. Take a probiotic supplement or consume probiotic foods at the end of your meal

2\. Consume probiotics earlier in the day

3\. If fasting, drink more water with your probiotics

4\. Don’t take probiotics with lemon water or apple cider vinegar water

5\. Consume raw plants grown in soil

## When should I take aspirin?

Aspirin is a common drug used for relieving minor aches, pains and fevers. However it’s not as good as it’s being promoted to be. One thing to know is that Dr. Berg is not telling you to come off aspirin. He does suggest that you do your own research about it and really make the best choice based on your health.

**Problems with aspirin:**

* Taking one aspirin a day provides no significant health benefits; it’s not a preventive thing
* Increased risk of hemorrhage (bleeding internally)
* Higher all-cause mortality
* Depletes vitamin C
* Depletes vitamin E
* Depletes folic acid
* Depletes zinc
* Depletes melatonin
* High risk of liver problems
* High risk of kidney dysfunctions
* High risk of cataracts
* High risk of erectile dysfunction
* High risk of ulcers
* Natural substitutes:
* Cod liver oil
* Vitamin E natural complex
* Stinging nettle root
* Potassium
* Intermittent fasting and Healthy Keto® diet

## When should magnesium not be taken for sleep and anxiety, and what are the potential risks or contraindications to consider?

Sometimes, low magnesium is not the cause of your anxiety or sleep problems, and taking it can even worsen your symptoms. The second part of sleep is called REM sleep. People with higher levels of adrenaline and cortisol tend to wake up around 2:00 am during REM sleep. Magnesium will not fix this problem because the high cortisol levels are not caused by low magnesium.

Stress and lack of exercise can cause poor sleep. Exercise, long walks, and physical labor can reduce stress and improve sleep. If you find that you have difficulty getting to sleep because of racing thoughts and overthinking, you may be low in vitamin B1. Carbs, sugar, and caffeine can deplete vitamin B1. Taking B1 before bed can provide an immediate sense of calmness. Always choose a natural B1 supplement, not synthetic.

Instead of taking a melatonin supplement, it can be more beneficial to address why you do not have enough melatonin in the first place. Melatonin is inhibited by blue light. Darkness and infrared light recharge melatonin, so try getting sunlight or sitting by a fire. Vitamin D before bed can help you sleep. Magnesium will not work if you're very low in vitamin D and vice versa.

If you're new to fasting and you go to bed hungry, it can interfere with your sleep. If fasting triggered your sleep problem, scale back, and begin fasting more gradually over time. Try incorporating more carbs at your last meal and increasing your carb intake to 50 grams per day. Having plenty of sea salt on keto and intermittent fasting is vital. Salt causes your body to retain fluid, so not only will it help you sleep, but it can also help prevent waking to use the bathroom. If you do need magnesium, try taking magnesium glycinate to help support sleep and reduce anxiety.

## Which acne treatments are most effective for addressing hormonal acne specifically, and how do their mechanisms of action differ from those targeting other types of acne?

The most effective treatment for hormonal acne often involves a combination of dietary and lifestyle changes. Low-carb diet, intermittent fasting, and stress-reducing techniques can lower the risk of menstrual acne and contribute to clearer skin.

***

## Which air purifiers would you recommend, particularly for individuals seeking effective filtration for allergens, pollutants, or improving overall indoor air quality?

For effective air purification, consider the following:

1\. **HEPA Filters**: Look for air purifiers with HEPA filters that can capture airborne particles and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

2\. **Ionizers**: Consider units with ionizing capabilities to help remove additional pollutants.

3\. **Reviews and Research**: Research and review options to find models that best meet your needs for removing toxins and improving air quality.

Investing in a high-quality air purifier is crucial for maintaining a healthy indoor environment.

## Which categories of foods are considered the most deleterious to cardiovascular health, potentially exacerbating the risk of heart disease?

**Consuming trans fats increases the risk of several serious health issues, including:**

• Heart attack

• Stroke

• Type 2 diabetes

• Cancer

• Increased LDL

• Decreased HDL

• Inflammation

• Autoimmune diseases

• Infertility

• Tendon and bone degeneration

Partially hydrogenated oils contain trans fats, but products that contain either partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated fats should be avoided to help protect against heart disease and other health problems.

It turns out that animal feed still contains trans fats. This means that you could consume trans fats indirectly by consuming animals fed trans fats. Restaurants also commonly serve foods containing trans fats.

There's even a loophole that allows half of a gram of trans fats in one serving size to claim that a product has zero trans fats. Overall, it's crucial to read food labels and be aware of what you're eating, especially at restaurants.

***

## Which component of the lemon—such as the juice, pulp, zest, or seeds—contains the highest concentration of nutrients and health benefits?

The most nutritious part of a lemon is the rind and the white pith beneath it, which are rich in flavonoids and other beneficial compounds. For optimal nutrition, blend the entire lemon, including the rind and seeds, rather than just juicing it. This method significantly increases nutrient intake. You can enhance the flavor with a few drops of stevia or blueberries for a healthier alternative to sweetened lemonade.

***

## Which dietary sources are most effective in naturally enhancing testosterone production?

Button mushrooms, celery, and cruciferous vegetables can all inhibit an enzyme called aromatase. This enzyme turns your testosterone into estrogen and for a guy, we don't want this. Aromatase can be increased by being overweight, drinking alcohol, having higher insulin, etc.

## Which eggs are healthier: white or brown?

Dr. Berg discussed if brown eggs are healthier than white eggs. The answer is NO. The reason why an egg has a certain color is because of the type of chicken. And the reason why the brown egg is more expensive than the white one is that the chicken is bigger and they have to feed the chicken more. It is important that the egg you consume is pasture-raised and organic.

**Types of Eggs**

• 100% natural

• Cage free / free range

• Pasture-raised

• Pasteurized

• Vegetarian-fed

• Organic Yolk Nutrients

• Choline

• Selenium

• Biotin

• Vitamin A, D, E, and K2

• B12

## Which foods should I prioritize to support and enhance liver detoxification?

**Cruciferous Vegetables**

Kale, broccoli, and cabbage enhance liver detoxification by stimulating enzyme production and reducing inflammation through their sulfur compounds.

**Blueberries**

Blueberries aid in reducing liver fibrosis and inflammation. Their low sugar content enhances their effectiveness in liver health.

**Choline-Rich Foods**

Eggs and fatty fish, rich in choline, help eliminate fat from the liver, supporting its detoxification processes.

**Probiotic Foods**

Sauerkraut and kefir improve detoxification and reduce inflammation by promoting gut health and bolstering liver function.

## Which fruits have anti-cancer properties, and what compounds contribute to their protective effects?

**Fruit: A Powerful Ally Against Cancer**

Many fruits contain compounds that have evolved to protect the plants themselves from environmental threats. These same compounds can offer significant benefits to humans, including powerful cancer-fighting properties. Here are some standout examples:

* **Berries**: Blueberries and blackberries are packed with anthocyanins, which have been shown to inhibit cancer growth and support a healthy gut microbiome, crucial for a strong immune system.
* **Citrus Fruits**: Lemons, limes, and grapefruits are rich in vitamin C and flavonoids, both of which boost the immune system and aid the liver in detoxifying harmful substances.
* **Pomegranates**: These unique fruits contain ellagic acid, known for its ability to protect DNA, reduce inflammation, and combat oxidative stress.
* **Grapes**: The phytonutrient resveratrol found in grapes has been extensively studied for its anti-aging and health-promoting effects. It helps protect your cells from damage that can lead to cancer.
* **Tomatoes**: Lycopene, the compound that gives tomatoes their red color, is a potent cancer fighter. Cooking tomatoes actually increases their lycopene content.
* **Avocados**: These creamy fruits are a good source of glutathione, a powerful antioxidant, and contain phytonutrients that may target cancer stem cells.
* **Olives**: Olives boast compounds like oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, which protect against cancer cell growth and may even promote cancer cell self-destruction.

While fruit does contain natural sugars, the fiber and phytonutrients they provide help mitigate any negative effects. Incorporating a variety of these cancer-fighting fruits into your diet is a delicious and effective way to support your overall health and potentially reduce your cancer risk.

## Which has a stronger anti-cancer effect: broccoli sprouts, microgreens, or radish sprouts, and how do their benefits compare?

There's some new research out which I just created a video on that talks, compares these two sprouts. And apparently the radish sprout has a more potent effect on cancer. I'm sure they're both great. But radish sprouts have that X factor.

Radishes are interesting because they tend to pull mucus from the body. They're very high in sulfur and they pull mucus from the deeper parts of the lung, the lymphatic system. They're a great cleaner. They're great for sinus congestion.

***

## Which herb is most effective for alleviating water retention, and how does it help manage this condition?

**Best Herbs for Water Retention**

The most effective herb for water retention can vary based on individual needs, but dandelion greens are often considered the best due to their liver support and high potassium content. They help the body eliminate excess water while providing essential nutrients.

**Other Effective Herbs:**

\- **Uva Ursi**: Known for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.

\- **Horsetail**: Contains silica, which strengthens tissues and acts as a diuretic.

\- **Garlic**: Helps reduce water retention by improving circulation and reducing inflammation.

\- **Black Tea**: Contains caffeine, which has natural diuretic effects.

\- **Parsley**: Acts as a mild diuretic and helps expel excess water from the body.

## Which is more advantageous for health: sardines or cod liver oil, and what are the key benefits of each?

Sardines are excellent for your health and a great source of omega-3s, but so is cod liver! You should consume both foods because they each have their own strengths.

**Cod liver and sardines contain omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. EPA helps reduce inflammation, while DHA supports the brain, nerves, and heart.**

**Sardines contain .9 to 2 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per serving while cod liver contains 9 to 11 grams per serving. Cod liver also contains significantly more vitamin D.**

**Sardines and cod liver contain vitamin A in its active form, retinol.** Vitamin A supports vision, vision at night, and the inner mucosal membranes of your mouth, throat, sinuses, and lungs. It’s also important for your thyroid. Sardines contain 32 mcg of vitamin A, and cod liver contains 5100 mcg!

**Cod liver does not surpass sardines in all aspects. Sardines are a better source of protein.** Cod liver is a rich source of folate at 300 mcg, while sardines only contain 10 mcg. Sardines contain 392 mg of calcium and 545 mg of phosphorus and cod liver contains 10 mg and 100 mg respectively.

**Cod liver and sardines contain about the same amount of B12 at 10.6 mcg and 11 mcg respectively.**

When comparing sardines to salmon, both fish contain B vitamins, but sardines are a better source of calcium, phosphorus, selenium, iron, magnesium, and zinc.

## Which is more effective for managing hormonal imbalances: hormone therapy or glandular therapy, and what are the benefits and limitations of each approach?

**Organotherapy uses organ extracts from animals. Hormone therapy uses synthetic versions of isolated hormones. Hormonal therapy has a myriad of potential complications and side effects.**

**Glandular therapy supports the endocrine system as a whole. When you take a glandular supplement, you’re getting:**

• Nutrients

• Growth factors

• Proteins

• Amino acids

• Peptides

• Cofactors

• Minerals

## Which is more efficacious in promoting digestive health: the alkalizing effects of baking soda or the acidifying properties of apple cider vinegar?

**Baking soda vs. Apple cider vinegar:**

Baking soda - Baking soda for indigestion will make you feel better because it’s going to help remove some of that excess acid in your esophagus. But, the next time you eat, you’re still going to have the same symptoms because it’s not corrective. Baking soda also contains a tremendous amount of sodium. When you increase sodium, you deplete potassium, which is connected to many different conditions. You also deplete chloride. This can cause you to deplete hydrochloric acid in your stomach and then cause you to need more baking soda.

Apple cider vinegar - Apple cider vinegar is a great natural remedy for indigestion. You need to dilute it. Mix one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water and take it before you eat.

The fluids in your stomach should be acid, but the blood in the body should be slightly alkaline. Alkalizing the body is not the best thing to do in every situation.

Consider using baking soda when you have symptoms of acidosis. Consider using apple cider vinegar when you have symptoms of alkalosis. You may also want to use calcium, magnesium, or potassium for acidosis type symptoms. For indigestion, try apple cider vinegar.

## Which key nutrient is most critical for enhancing collagen synthesis and maintaining its structural integrity within the body?

Copper is essential for collagen synthesis, as it is a crucial cofactor in the enzyme responsible for creating connective tissue. A deficiency in copper, often caused by excessive zinc intake, can lead to weakened collagen, resulting in skin sagging and increased susceptibility to hernias and aneurysms. Ensuring adequate copper levels is vital for maintaining healthy collagen.

## Which method of vegetable preparation—raw or cooked—provides superior health benefits and nutritional advantages?

Vegetables have numerous health benefits. They are packed with important vitamins and minerals and are high in fiber. Vegetables are also loaded with phytonutrients, which are hard to get from other types of foods. Phytonutrients have a range of incredible health benefits, from protecting against inflammation to fighting cancer.

Raw vegetables grown on soil even contain probiotics, which are friendly bacteria. Organic vegetables have a higher diversity of friendly microbes than non-organic vegetables. But keep in mind that the more you cook a vegetable, the more you’ll lessen the probiotic effects.

It’s important to note that not everyone can tolerate high amounts of vegetables. If you are immune compromised or have any inflammatory condition in the gut, you may have difficulty consuming vegetables. If you consume raw vegetables and you feel worse, you may do better on the carnivore diet for a while. However, you could also try fermented vegetables or cooked vegetables.

However, if you lightly steam or sauté your vegetables, you won’t lose minerals or as many vitamins. Steaming or sautéing vegetables may actually enhance the phytonutrients—but the data on this is inconsistent.

**As far as raw vegetables vs. cooked vegetables, I believe it’s best to consume a good portion of your vegetables raw. But, certain vegetables should be cooked, like Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cauliflower. The worst thing you can do as far as preserving the nutrient content in your vegetables is to fry them. You can still consume fried vegetables but don’t think you’re getting a lot of nutrients from them.**

## Which specific foods should individuals with diabetes avoid to effectively manage their condition, and what are the underlying reasons for these dietary restrictions?

Diabetics should avoid high-carb and sugary foods such as refined grains, sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, and processed snacks. In addition, it’s recommended to limit starches, such as white rice, flour, pasta, bread, and crackers, as these foods cause rapid blood sugar spikes, which contribute to insulin resistance and diabetes.

***

## Which specific stretching exercises are most effective in alleviating stiffness and improving flexibility in targeted areas of the body?

Many of us have been taught to stretch by holding a position for 30 to 60 seconds—this is called static stretching. But this is the worst way to stretch your muscles. Tight muscles are weaker and are more susceptible to injury and inflammation. When you stretch incorrectly, you can easily strain or pull a muscle.

Motion is all about the coordination of contraction and relaxation of the muscles. One of the best ways to stretch is a method from a book called The Whartons’ Complete Strength Book, and it’s called Active Isolated Flexibility.

**How to stretch correctly (using Active Isolated Flexibility):**

1\. Identify the muscle you want to stretch

2\. Contract or tighten the opposite muscle as you stretch

3\. Stretch to a comfortable limit and hold for two seconds and then relax

Repeat this method of stretching eight to ten times per muscle. This would be a great warm-up before you exercise. You may also want to consider a version of this as part of the rehab process for a less severe injury.

## Which type of carbohydrate is most effective at lowering cholesterol levels, and how does it contribute to improved cardiovascular health?

In some cases, it’s not a problem if cholesterol is a little bit higher. This can happen when you first start the keto diet because you’re mobilizing cholesterol from the fat cells. But what can you do if you need to lower bad cholesterol naturally? There is one specific food that can really help you.

Your body makes cholesterol. Excess cholesterol is eliminated through the bile ducts with the help of bile salts. Bile salts have a lot of important roles in the body.

Typically, carbohydrates will increase cholesterol and triglycerides. There are three types of carbohydrates: sugar, starches, and fiber. Fiber can actually help reduce your cholesterol, but it has to be the right type of fiber. We’re talking about the fiber in vegetables.

Vegetables have low amounts of sugar and high amounts of fiber. They’re also rich in nutrients, phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals.

Fiber helps bind with cholesterol and modify the absorption of lipids and fats. It also increases the production of bile and eliminates bile connected to cholesterol.Fiber has zero effect on blood sugar and insulin, which will help lower your cholesterol. Feeding your microbes fiber also decreases the production of cholesterol.

If you have high cholesterol, consume more vegetables to help increase the release of bile and feed the microbes. At the same time, be sure to avoid sugar and starch in your diet.

***

## Which type of carbohydrate lowers LDL cholesterol quickly, and how does it work?

Ever wondered why doctors recommend vegetables for high cholesterol? The secret lies in vegetable fiber! It's like having tiny bodyguards fighting cholesterol in your system.

**Understanding Cholesterol and Bile Salts**

Your body produces more cholesterol than you consume. Bile salts, produced by the liver, act as a detergent, breaking down fats and escorting excess cholesterol out of your body. Insufficient bile production can lead to constipation and increased cholesterol levels.

**Vegetable Fiber: The Cholesterol-Lowering Champion**

Vegetable fiber is superior to other fibers for reducing cholesterol. It acts like a sponge, soaking up bile salts and preventing their reabsorption into the bloodstream. Unlike other fibers, vegetable fiber doesn't raise insulin levels, making it an ideal choice.

**Nutritional Powerhouses**

Vegetables are low in sugar, high in fiber, and packed with phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals, making them essential for overall health and cholesterol management.

**How Fiber Works its Magic**

* **Binds with Cholesterol:** Fiber traps cholesterol in the gut, preventing it from entering the bloodstream.
* **Increases Bile Production:** Fiber encourages the liver to produce more bile salts, further aiding cholesterol elimination.
* **Stabilizes Blood Sugar and Insulin:** Fiber doesn't spike blood sugar or insulin levels, unlike simple carbs.
* **Nourishes Gut Microbes:** Fiber feeds beneficial gut bacteria, which produce short-chain fatty acids that reduce inflammation and promote gut health, crucial for managing cholesterol.

**Dietary Recommendations**

* **Increase Vegetable Intake:** Aim for at least five servings of fiber-rich vegetables like broccoli, carrots, and Brussels sprouts daily.
* **Avoid Sugars and Starches:** Reduce consumption of sugary drinks and refined carbohydrates, as they raise blood sugar and indirectly contribute to high cholesterol.

**Conclusion**

Lowering cholesterol naturally starts with adding more vegetables to your diet. They are your allies in the battle against high cholesterol, thanks to their fiber content and nutritional benefits. By making simple dietary changes, you can take control of your health and enjoy a cholesterol-friendly lifestyle.

## Which vitamin is most effective for promoting healthy skin, and how does it contribute to skin health and appearance?

**If you are deficient in vitamin B3, you can end up with pellagra. However, there’s also a subclinical version of this B3 deficiency. This is a situation where you have dermatitis—dry, brittle, scaly, and red skin.**

**Vitamin B3 helps protect and restore your DNA, which results in your skin feeling and looking vibrant and healthy.**

Studies show that those with pellagra see amazing results when taking vitamin B3. Those with pellagra often consume too much corn, flour, rice, and alcohol. To fix this problem, people started adding synthetic vitamin B3 to enhance these foods. The problem is, synthetic vitamins don’t have the same effects as natural ones.

**A healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting eliminate this problem. You should know that the best form of vitamin B3 is niacinamide.**

**Vitamin B3 can also help with:**

• Brown spots

• Skin cancer

• Anti-aging

• Decreased acne

***

## Which vitamin or mineral is most likely to produce toxic effects when taken in excessive amounts, and what are the potential health risks associated with high doses?

Out of all the vitamins and minerals, which one produces the most toxic effect if taken in large amounts? - Iron is the worst thing to take in excessive amounts because we don't have real any biochemical mechanism to get rid of iron. So when the cells take an iron, the cell dies off and then it gets eliminated through the bowel. Iron in high amounts, we don't need a lot of it and we can get anemia without of it, if you're deficient in it. But if you get too much way, it can create all sorts of problems and you never want to take iron when you have an infection.

***

## Which vitamins and minerals are most effective at neutralizing free radicals, and how do they contribute to reducing oxidative stress and supporting overall health?

Several vitamins and minerals play a crucial role in removing free radicals:

1\. **Vitamin C Complex**: Natural sources of vitamin C, as found in whole foods, provide effective antioxidant protection.

2\. **Zinc and Selenium**: These essential minerals support the body's antioxidant defenses.

3\. **Cruciferous Vegetables**: Rich in phytonutrients, these vegetables help neutralize free radicals.

4\. **Herbal Antioxidants**: Curcumin and garlic are notable for their powerful antioxidant properties.

5\. **Fasting**: Promotes the body's natural production of antioxidants.

6\. **Ketogenic Diet**: Ketones act as antioxidants, making a ketogenic diet beneficial for reducing oxidative stress.

Incorporating these nutrients and practices can significantly enhance the body's ability to combat free radicals.

***

## Which vitamins help prevent diabetic complications, and how do they support blood sugar, nerve health, and metabolism?

**Today I’m going to share five vitamins that can help with the complications of diabetes. High blood glucose affects four main tissues, including:**

1\. The eyes

2\. The arteries

3\. The nervous system (including the brain)

4\. The kidneys

However, the damage to these tissues can lead to a myriad of health problems. Glycation is a combination of sugar and protein in the body, and it can lead to this dysfunction of tissues. An A1C score is basically a number that represents glycated hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells) to help tell how bad someone’s diabetes is. Glycation can also occur when someone consumes a combination of sugar or carbs and protein or fat. When glycation occurs, it can build up into advanced glycation end products (AGEs). With AGEs comes a lot of free radical damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress.

**The good news is that there are natural things that can inhibit glycation. Vitamins that inhibit glycation:**

1\. Benfotiamine

2\. Vitamin C

3\. Vitamin D

4\. Vitamin E (tocotrienols complex without tocopherols)

5\. Vitamin B6

***

## Who should avoid taking vitamin K2 supplements, and what specific health conditions or medications may contraindicate its use due to potential interactions or adverse effects?

## Why do we need magnesium?

**These are some of the most commonly known benefits of magnesium:**

1\. Leg cramps

2\. Relaxation & calmness

3\. Sleep

4\. Inflammation

5\. Blood sugar

6\. Electrolyte

7\. Bone health

8\. Energy (ATP)

Magnesium has a significant effect on the cardiovascular system. However, it’s also important that you consume a healthy diet. Taking magnesium won’t make much of a difference if you’re eating an unhealthy, carb-loaded diet.

The best sources of magnesium are vegetables. The average person only consumes 1.5 cups of vegetables each day—but you need 7 to 10 cups of vegetables daily for optimal health.

**Other sources of magnesium include:** • Grains (avoid!) • Green vegetables • Nuts and seeds • Seafood • Meats • Berries

## Why is lemon juice beneficial for managing gout arthritis but potentially detrimental for osteoarthritis?

Well, it’s actually both. In this video, I want to explain why lemon juice is both good and bad for arthritis.

Gout arthritis - High levels of uric acid. Gout symptoms get better when you make things alkaline. When you consume lemon juice and it’s metabolized, it turns into an alkaline substance. This makes lemon juice a good remedy for gout. But, the lemon juice remedy for gout is really just a quick fix. It will help you feel better, but you still need to work on the real cause of the issue.

Osteoarthritis - Calcium deposits within the joints. Osteoarthritis symptoms get worse when things are more alkaline. When you alkalize the body, you can create a flare-up of osteoarthritis. With osteoarthritis, you need to acidify the body by taking apple cider vinegar.

As a side note, when doing intermittent fasting, your body will produce more uric acid. If you’re sensitive to uric acid, it may cause a flare-up of gout. In this case, you can take lemon juice or potassium citrate to alkalize the body.

## Why might eating grapefruit help alleviate symptoms of GERD, and what are the mechanisms behind this effect?

Grapefruit contains phytonutrients that can aid digestion and act as a natural antacid, potentially alleviating GERD symptoms. Additionally, incorporating foods like broccoli sprouts or cabbage may offer similar benefits. GERD often relates to a valve issue or insufficient stomach acid, which can sometimes be addressed with betaine hydrochloride supplementation.

***

## Why should I breathe through my nose?

When you restrict airflow by breathing through the nose, some very interesting things occur. You actually get more oxygen delivered to your tissues when nose breathing than when you breathe through your mouth. When you breathe through your nose, the sinuses help moisten the air as it goes into the lungs. This protects the lungs from irritation and inflammation. Your nose also helps filter the air as it goes into the lungs and can protect the lungs against pathogens. CO2 isn’t just a waste product. It’s essential. It takes CO2 to push oxygen from your blood into your cells. A few potential side effects of sinus surgery are dry sinuses and difficulty breathing. You need the mucous membranes to balance out oxygen and CO2. Oxygen therapy and certain conditions can also cause low CO2. Low CO2 can cause the body to be more alkaline, which can cause low calcium in the blood. Both of these issues can lead to a myriad of symptoms. When you breathe through your nose, you can increase the amount of oxygen in your cells by about 20%. Nose breathing helps increase the right amount of CO2 in your body to push oxygen into your cells. This will help oxygenate your brain and muscles, especially when you sleep and exercise. Increasing the oxygen in your cells can also help with stress.

***

## Why should I choose benfotiamine over allithiamine and thiamine?

**Why Choose Benfotiamine Over Allithiamine or Thiamine?**

* **Choose Benfotiamine:** As a form of Vitamin B1, Benfotiamine supports the health and function of the nervous system. Its lipid-soluble nature allows it to be utilized effectively within nerve tissues, including penetrating the myelin sheath, which is crucial for normal nerve structure. It also contributes to normal cardiovascular function and energy production.
* **Choose Allithiamine** As a naturally sourced form of Vitamin B1, Allithiamine contributes to meeting daily thiamine requirements. Adequate Vitamin B1 supports normal energy production, brain function, and the health of the nervous system.
* **Choose Thiamine** if you need a basic, water-soluble form of Vitamin B1 for general supplementation.

Ultimately, the choice depends on your specific health goals and needs. If you're unsure, consulting with a healthcare professional can help determine which form of Vitamin B1 is best for you.

***

## Why should you never take Vitamin A supplements?

Vitamin A toxicity is rare, but taking a synthetic vitamin A supplement may increase your risk. Synthetic vitamin A may also increase the risk of lung cancer. Accutane, a form of synthetic vitamin A, has serious potential side effects. I suggest getting your vitamin A from food sources or natural food-based supplements.

Foods high in vitamin A (retinol):

• Cod liver oil

• Egg yolks

• Grass-fed butter

• Grass-fed cheese

• Liver

Beta carotene is the precursor to the active form of vitamin A (retinol). Beta carotene is in foods like carrots and spinach. But, If you’re relying on beta carotene alone to get your vitamin A or if you have a liver or gallbladder issue, you could be deficient in vitamin A.

## Worse than Sugar

**Hidden Sugars: The Dangers of Synthetic Starches in Ultra-Processed Foods**

Don't be fooled by "sugar-free" labels! Many ultra-processed foods are loaded with synthetic starches that can be even worse for your blood sugar than sugar itself. These hidden sugars can lead to:

* **Insulin Resistance and Diabetes:** Repeated blood sugar spikes from synthetic starches can lead to insulin resistance, where your body can't properly use insulin to control blood sugar. This can progress to diabetes, a serious health condition.
* **Nutrient Depletion and Inflammation:** These starches lack essential nutrients like protein, fiber, and vitamins. They can even deplete your body of vitamin D and B1, leading to inflammation, fatigue, and impaired energy production.
* **Gut Health Issues:** Synthetic starches can disrupt your gut microbiome, feeding harmful bacteria and potentially contributing to conditions like SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth).

**Common Culprits:**

* **Modified corn starch:** Used as a thickener and flavor carrier.
* **Maltodextrin:** Often used as a filler in processed foods and even protein powders, with potentially damaging effects on your cells.

**Protect your health by:**

* **Reading labels carefully:** Don't be fooled by "sugar-free" claims. Look for hidden starches like modified corn starch, maltodextrin, and others.
* **Minimizing consumption of ultra-processed foods:** Limit your intake of packaged snacks, processed meats, and ready meals.

**Key takeaway:** Synthetic starches are hidden sugars that can wreak havoc on your health. Be aware of their presence in ultra-processed foods and make informed choices to protect your well-being.
