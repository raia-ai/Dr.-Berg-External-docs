## Are all the recipes keto-friendly?

Yes! These recipes are 100% keto-friendly!

## Are brown rice cakes keto?

No, brown rice cakes aren’t keto-friendly, either.

While brown rice offers some nutritional advantages over white rice - such as more dietary fiber - these benefits are minimal. Brown rice-based products still contain considerable amounts of carbs that can interfere with fat-burning and push you out of ketosis.

Additionally, brown rice-derived snacks like crackers or chips often include other ingredients such as sugars, flour, or syrups, increasing their net carb content.

Rice cake net carbs:

* White rice cakes: 7g per piece
* Brown rice cakes: 6g per piece
* Caramel rice cake: 11g per piece

Rice cakes aren't a good option for individuals on a keto diet due to their considerable carb content and the adverse effect on glucose levels.

Instead, exploring [keto-friendly snack alternatives](https://www.drberg.com/blog/keto-snacks-guide) that align with your dietary goals is best.

## Are celery and nut butter good on Keto?

Absolutely, yes! Celery and nut butter can be a good alternative to salad for some people. It’s hard for some people to consume the amount of salad that they need, but eating celery with peanut butter is easier.

The peanut butter or nut butter should be organic and shouldn’t have any added sugar. There also shouldn’t be any extra oils in the peanut butter other than peanut oil. If you do choose celery with peanut butter instead of salad, you may want to consume a good amount of it. Celery is low carb, but high fiber. Fiber is a carb, but it doesn’t affect your blood sugar.

**A few celery nutrition facts:**

• Starch—0

• Potassium (per cup of celery)—262mg

• Sodium (per cup of celery)— 80mg

**A few benefits of celery with nut butter:**

1\. An alternative to salad

2\. It can help pH and reduce the risk of gout

3\. It can help reduce hunger (because of the fat in the nut butter)

4\. It can help lower stress

5\. It can help a person sleep

6\. It can help support healthy blood pressure levels

## Are dates keto-friendly?

More and more of these sweet fruits and sweet things you see them in certain keto plans. And unfortunately now it's so many other even synthetic carbohydrates and stuff that are being put in to these so-called healthy keto friendly meals.Dates even though it's natural. It just has a lot of sugar. It has the vitamins and minerals but it has a lot of sugar. It's definitely not keto friendly.

***

## Are granola bars keto-friendly and safe to consume?

No.

When you see a box of granola bars, you may note that the packaging says it’s 100% natural and organic, and it contains no artificial flavoring or coloring. That means that it must be healthy – right?

If you read the back label of the granola bars, the “healthy” granola bar may not seem so healthy. Here’s what is in a typical granola bar:

* Whole oats
* Sugar
* Canola oil
* Yellow corn flour
* Soy flour
* Brown sugar syrup
* Baking soda
* Natural flavoring

Keep in mind that the first few ingredients on a particular label typically make up the majority of the product.

These ingredients make up 29 grams of carbohydrates per serving. They are very high on the glycemic index, which means they have the potential to contribute to blood sugar issues and weight gain.

In summary, granola bars are not keto-friendly at all. They contain a massive amount of sugar that will knock you out of ketosis very quickly. Avoid these products at all costs.

## Are hot dogs safe to consume on Keto?

If you’re going to get a hot dog, get an organic grass-fed hot dog that has sea salt and celery powder instead of preservatives and make sure it doesn’t have any sugar.

## Are Keto snacks safe to eat on a Ketogenic Diet?

**There are so many different kinds of keto snacks available now, like protein bars, keto bombs, and much more. But, these keto snacks can actually decrease your results significantly. You’re going to plateau.**

The goal of keto is to decrease and normalize insulin. Every time you eat anything of significant calories, you will spike insulin. So, the more frequent the meals, the more insulin you’re going to have, and the less progress you’re going to make with weight loss and your overall health.

Low-calorie foods like vegetables won’t spike insulin too much, especially if it’s filled with fiber, like leafy greens. So, this could be an exception.

Let’s say you’re doing intermittent fasting, and your first meal is at 12 pm, and your next meal is at 7 pm. But, you have a snack in between because this time is technically your eating window. I don’t recommend doing this. I don’t recommend eating anything during the day except for during your first meal and second meal. So, after 7 pm, you would fast again until 12 pm the next day. To really see some significant changes, you may want to work up to an 18 hour fast. However, some people may need to go up to 20 hours or even 23 hours of fasting.

A lot of keto snacks and keto bombs are okay to have, but you should only eat them with your meal.

## Are Konjac noodles keto-friendly?

Other names for konjac noodles are miracle noodles or shirataki noodles. Konjac noodles are keto-friendly. They are 97% water and 3% fiber. Fiber is a carb, but it doesn’t have any effect on insulin.

**This type of fiber can have some interesting effects, including:**

• It may act as a detox

• It may help support weight loss

• It may help loosen mucus

Something to keep in mind about these noodles is that they are flavorless. So, you’ll have to add things to them to make them flavorful. These noodles do not have the same texture as pasta noodles, but they’re similar. You may also get very thirsty if you consume these noodles.

**Benefits of konjac noodles:**

• They can decrease hunger

• They may help stabilize your blood sugars

• They may help decrease constipation

• They don’t have any calories

**Other keto pasta alternatives:**

• Spaghetti squash

• Zucchini noodles

***

## Are my ketone levels elevated beyond a safe range?

Ketone levels become a concern when they reach 9 or 10 mmol/L, which is typically only seen in individuals with diabetes who may neglect their insulin regimen. For most individuals, normal ketone levels range from 0.5 to 3 mmol/L. Engaging in fasting can elevate ketone levels, often reaching around 4 mmol/L, while exercise can push levels to approximately 5 or 6 mmol/L. However, it is unlikely for levels to exceed this range in healthy individuals. If you have concerns about your ketone levels, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

***

## Are Xanthan and Guar Gum keto-friendly?

**What is xanthan gum?** Xanthan gum is an additive used in a lot of different foods as a thickener and to provide texture. It’s used in a lot of bread recipes because it can replace gluten.

**Is xanthan gum keto-friendly?** Xanthan gum usually made from corn, glucose, or soy. It’s technically keto-friendly. It has zero net carbs, and it won’t affect your blood sugars. But, if you were to consume this, you would want to make sure the product you’re buying is non-GMO.

**What is guar gum?** Guar gum comes from the guar bean.

**Is guar gum keto-friendly?** Guar gum has zero net carbs, and it is keto-friendly.

Xanthan gum vs. guar gum Xanthan gum and guar gum are very similar. The big difference is the source. Guar gum is going to be non-GMO naturally. But, Xanthan gum could be GMO, so it’s important to make sure the product you buy is non-GMO.

***

## As someone with elevated cholesterol, is keto even possible while I eat only fish?

Absolutely because here's some data that you may not know. Cholesterol many times especially the kind that can invade your arteries is converted from carbs. So if you're doing the fatty fish hence you're going to be fine. Then do the rest vegetables, not the grains, not the sugar because the fatty liver can be coming from nonfat sources. It could be coming from vegan carbohydrates. And so they found that if you do a low carb diet the fat on your liver potentially can reduce to 50% in two weeks.

I would combine the healthy keto with the fish and do an intermittent fasting together. That'll be your best bet. I'd probably add into the mix the milk thistle because that's one of the best remedies for supporting liver and improving liver enzymes. The cruciferous vegetables are great for the liver.

**\*Please keep in mind that the above is not a medical advice. You should see your doctor about any possible medical conditions.**

## Best Keto Crackers

I believe the best keto cracker is the “Finn Crisp Thin Rye Crispbread.” You might be able to find these at a health food store or online. You could add sour cream, cheese, guacamole, or hummus with these as well.

These keto crackers are whole-grain rye crackers. They have a very small amount of gluten, but if you’re gluten-sensitive, these might not be an option.

**Finn Crisp Thin Rye Crispbread (per slice):**

Total carbs — 5g

Fiber — 1g

Net carbs — 4g

## Can a ketogenic diet help reverse kidney disease?

High levels of glucose and insulin create oxidative damage to four tissues; brain (nerves), heart, eye, and kidney. B-hydroxybutyrate that is in ketone can provide an alternative fuel, it also has benefits for the kidney and decreases oxidative stress. Ketosis can counter the damage from a high-carb diet.

**Important Points:**

• Potassium is protective of the kidney

• Certain amino acids can slow progression of kidney damage

• It is important to consume nutrient-dense foods – it protects against the side effects and complications of the oxidation

• low carb diet – it is very beneficial to the kidney

_**We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**_

***

## Can alcohol-induced gastrointestinal damage be corrected with keto and IF?

To a large degree it can. But I think you're going to need some additional things to help correct it. If you do the healthy version of keto and you include more probiotics, and get a nice diversified group of microbes living in your intestine testes that can actually help fortify and help build up the mucus layer that's needed in the GI tract. That mucus layer is really what's missing with so many people and their health problems. And that mucus layer is generated by eating healthy and having enough microbes and making sure they're doing their job. When you lose the mucus layer, you lose your immune system because then you have less of a buffer for these pathogens to invade. And then you start getting autoimmune diseases and inflammatory diseases. That mucus layer is going to be really key to maintain your health and you can have a good start by doing the healthy keto.

***

## Can anyone do Keto?

The ketogenic diet is generally considered safe and well-tolerated by most people and has been found especially beneficial for obese individuals and those with type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, PCOS, metabolic syndrome, and elevated cholesterol levels.

However, individuals with eating disorders and those taking medications that impact fat metabolism should consult a healthcare provider before starting a ketogenic diet to minimize the risk of side effects.

***

## Can following a ketogenic diet lead to high LDL cholesterol levels?

LDL (low-density lipoprotein) serves as a transporter for cholesterol, delivering it where needed, while HDL (high-density lipoprotein) functions as a cholesterol scavenger, returning it to the liver. Cholesterol is essential for bodily functions. On keto, fat cells initially hold onto cholesterol, leading to a temporary spike in LDL. However, over time, stored cholesterol is released and processed. Increased dietary fat on keto can elevate cholesterol levels. LDL comes in two types: Type A (large and harmless) and Type B (small and inflammatory). Keto may promote more Type A LDL. To manage LDL, focus on fiber-rich veggies and moderate fat intake.

***

## Can Healthy Keto help with psoriasis?

Yes, the Healthy Keto® diet can help with psoriasis. Here are some key points from Dr. Berg's recommendations:

\- **Anti-Inflammatory Foods**: Incorporating anti-inflammatory foods such as berries, vegetables, fatty fish, and nuts into your diet can help reduce inflammation, which may alleviate symptoms of psoriasis.

\- **Healthy Fats**: Consuming healthy fats like avocados, nuts, and fatty fish provides essential fatty acids for maintaining healthy skin. These fatty acids help moisturize your skin, reduce inflammation, and protect against sun damage.

\- **Vitamin D and Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Supplementing with vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, found in cod liver oil, can help manage psoriasis symptoms. Vitamin D helps regulate T-cells, and omega-3s are potent anti-inflammatories that can reduce dry, scaly, and red skin.

\- **Bile Salts**: Bile salts stimulate vitamin D receptors, allowing vitamin D to work more effectively in the body, which can benefit psoriasis.

\- **Intermittent Fasting**: Combining intermittent fasting with a ketogenic diet can significantly lower insulin levels and improve skin conditions. Limiting your eating window each day gives your body a chance to rest and repair, which can benefit skin health.

By taking charge of your diet and incorporating these elements, you can actively manage symptoms of psoriasis and improve overall skin health. Remember, always consult with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for your individual needs.

## Can I add carrots to my salad on keto?

Yes in moderate amounts.

**What is the glycemic index of carrots?**

It’s 72, which is high.

**What is the glycemic index?**

It’s a scale of carbohydrates and how fast each carbohydrate will raise your blood sugar. Below 55 is low, above 70 is high.

But, we need to look at the whole picture.

The glycemic load is the concentration of carbohydrates in a food. The glycemic load will take into consideration the fiber, as well.

The calculation for glycemic load is:

The glycemic index multiplied by the number of carbs divided by 100. Less than 10 would be low, over 21 would be high.

**For carrots:**

72 multiplied by 4 g divided by 100 = 2.88 (very low)

Even though carrots are high on the glycemic index, they have a lot of fiber which inhibits the glycemic reaction.

But, different variables, like taking the carrot juice out of the carrot fiber, or cooking the carrots, can raise the glycemic index.

Overall, are carrots healthy? Yes.

Are carrots one of the keto-friendly vegetables? Yes.

Can I eat corn on keto? No, due to the high carbohydrate content.

Corn nutritional profile: Potassium 476 mg Carbohydrates 123 g Sugar 1 g Protein 16 g

***

## Can I add honey to the apple cider vinegar drink for keto?

No. About 56% of honey is fructose and 44% of it is glucose. Honey has a glycemic index of 78, which is high. The problem with fructose is that only the cells in the liver can deal with it. So, fructose puts a lot of stress on the liver and can create a lot of additional problems. If you had to choose between honey and sugar, honey might be the better option because it has some antioxidants and some antimicrobial properties. It may also help with certain allergies. But, overall, honey is low in actual nutrients. It may be better than refined sugar, but not by much.

***

## Can I be in ketosis despite no ketones in urine?

**The first thing you need to know is that there are three types of ketones:**

1\. Acetate

2\. Acetoacetate

3\. Beta-hydroxybutyrate

**The specific type of keto that keto urine tests test for is acetoacetate.** Keto urine tests do not test for the other two forms of ketones. As you adapt to keto, you convert acetoacetate to beta-hydroxybutyrate. The problem is that keto urine tests cannot test for beta-hydroxybutyrate, so they may give you a false reading.

Keto urine tests can’t tell you what’s going on in the blood and other places in the body.

If you want to check for beta-hydroxybutyrate, you can get a blood test. Unfortunately, these tests can be expensive. Look for other signs that you’re in ketosis. Are you losing weight? Are you feeling good? Is your waist size getting smaller? These are signs that you’re in fat-burning mode. If your carbs are 20 grams or less each day, you’re likely in ketosis.

***

## Can I be thin and have insulin resistance?

Insulin resistance can affect individuals of all body types, including those who are thin and struggle to gain weight. It can impact blood sugar levels, mood, cognitive function, and may lead to fatty liver, which isn't always apparent physically.

When following a ketogenic diet, especially when combined with fasting, maintaining weight can be challenging.

***

## Can I consume agave nectar on keto?

No. Agave nectar is 90% fructose and 10% glucose. It’s not recommended.

Fructose is metabolized very differently in the body compared to glucose. Concentrated fructose puts tremendous stress on the liver because the liver is the only part of the body that can deal with fructose. Where the liver is concerned, metabolizing fructose is almost identical to consuming alcohol.

Fructose can potentially lead to:

* A fatty liver
* Insulin resistance
* Bad cholesterol (high LDL)
* High uric acid (gout)

When you consume fruit, the fiber and nutrients in the fruit help buffer the fructose. This means fruit doesn’t have near the effect that concentrated fructose (like agave nectar) has on the liver.

The main problem with fruit is that it can potentially slow down weight loss.

***

## Can I consume American cheeses on keto?

Many people prefer European cheeses over American cheeses.

The cheeses that contain the most probiotics are aged cheeses that aren’t heated. Keep an eye out for raw milk cheeses – these are the ones that you want.

Make sure the cheese you buy is organic and from grass-fed cows. Soft cheese has more friendly bacteria than hard cheese. Here are some cheeses you should try:

* Cheddar
* Parmesan
* Swiss
* Gruyere
* Gouda (best probiotic cheese)

Keep in mind that you should consume only a moderate amount of cheese. Cheese can contain hormones that may affect your prostate or contribute to fibroids in high amounts. Don’t overdo it and you should be fine.

***

## Can I consume asparagus on keto?

Yes. It has a lot of nutritional benefits:

* Prebiotic – a fiber that doesn’t break down until it hits the large intestines; the microbes in the large intestines live on this fiber, which helps you build up your friendly bacteria
* High in vitamin K, folate, and B1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 – good for stress and energy and calming your nervous system down
* High in phosphorus – a great way to improve your energy
* Diuretic – gets rid of excess fluids because asparagus is low in sodium and high in potassium so it is a mild kidney detoxifier
* Protection from kidney stones and dissolving them
* High in chromium – a mineral that helps repair insulin resistance. It makes your cells more insulin-sensitive, helping nutrients to go through the cell wall and regulating glucose. Great for diabetics, good for hypoglycemic people, and definitely helps insulin resistance

***

## Can I consume beets on keto?

Yes. beetroot and beet tops themselves are great for the diet. Although beets contain more sugar than some vegetables, the fiber they contain binds to the sugar, which helps prevent blood sugar spikes.

You can consume beets in your salads and beet tops in your smoothies. They are fantastic for promoting a healthy body.

* Beets are amazing for boosting your liver detoxification process. They help with the enzymes that break down and eliminate toxins. If you have a fatty liver, it’s a good idea to add plenty of beets to your diet.
* Beets can support healthy testosterone levels and estrogen levels.
*   Beets promote a healthy cardiovascular system by helping support healthy blood pressure levels.

***

## Can I consume berries on keto?

Yes, in moderate amounts.

Berries are loaded with phytonutrients. These phytonutrients have some really interesting potential health properties.

A few potential health benefits of berries:

* They’re antioxidants
* They can help blood sugars
* They’re high in fiber
* They’re high in vitamin C
* They can help reduce inflammation

The best berries to have on keto (1 cup):

* Strawberry – net carbs 8.1 g, sugar 7 g
* Blueberry – net carbs 17.4 g, sugar 15 g
* Blackberry – net carbs 6 g, sugar 7 g
* Raspberry – net carbs 7 g, sugar 5 g

Dried berries can have as much as 132 g of net carbs and 80 g of sugar per cup. So fresh and frozen berries are keto-friendly, but dried berries are not keto-friendly and should be avoided.

***

## Can I consume blue cheese on keto?

Yes! Make sure you get a high-quality version of it.

***

## Can I consume breakfast on Keto?

Many people say it’s the most important meal of the day–right? Some people will say that there are a lot of negative health consequences associated with skipping breakfast.

The idea that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and that skipping breakfast is a bad thing basically started with a fear campaign to get people to eat more cereal and bacon.

Dr. Berg believes it’s false that eating breakfast is important. If you skip breakfast, you could potentially help prevent certain health problems.

The real benefits of skipping breakfast:

* Weight loss
* Less appetite
* Mental clarity
* Faster metabolism
* Fewer cravings
* Better mood
* Less tendency toward metabolic syndrome

***

## Can I consume broccoli on keto?

Yes. It is very healthy and keto-friendly. Consume broccoli as long as you don’t have a sensitivity to it.

***

## Can I consume burger patties on keto?

Yes, ideally 100% grass-fed and grass-finished organic burger patties.

On the package of grass-fed burger patties it will often say:

* Natural
* Handcrafted
* Fresh
* Free-range
* 100% pure beef

***

## Can I consume butternut squash on keto?

**Yes.**

100 grams of squash is about 3 grams of carbs, 2 grams of sugar, 1 gram of fiber, and 1 grams of protein. It has a low glycemic load which means it has a good amount of fiber to buffer the carbohydrate. Squash is very keto-friendly.

**Nutrients in Squash:**

• Vitamin C

• Vitamin A

• Magnesium

• Manganese

• Potassium

**Types of Keto-Friendly Squash**

• Butternut

• Winter

• Spaghetti

• Acorn

***

## Can I consume cabbage on keto?

Yes.

**Benefits of red cabbage**

* 10 times more vitamin A than green cabbage
* More vitamin C than green cabbage
* 2 times more iron than green cabbage
* Anthocyanins (anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, reduces free radical damage)

**Benefits of green cabbage:**

* More vitamin A than red cabbage

Both green cabbage and red cabbage contain

* Phytonutrients
* Sinigrin – sulfur (anti-cancer)
* Polyphenols
* Flavonoids
* DIM

One of the biggest health benefits of cabbage (both types) is for ulcers and gastritis (juice of the cabbage, sauerkraut, coleslaw).

Sauerkraut has about 10 times more vitamin C than non-fermented cabbage)

**More cabbage benefits:**

* Cabbage is good for the blood sugars
* Cabbage can help balance estrogen dominance

**Which type of cabbage is healthier?** Both red cabbage and green cabbage are healthy. Red cabbage has a little bit more nutrient content. Both types of cabbage are highly recommended.

***

## Can I consume canola oil on keto?

No. It is not recommended, as most canola oils are highly refined products that can cause a lot of inflammation.

***

## Can I consume coconut oil on keto?

Some people are a little nervous about consuming coconut oil, based on false information. By the way, it’s not bad for your heart, nor is it a poison. It’s been used for hundreds of years by many cultures without problems. In fact, there are some cultures whose diet is 60 percent coconut-based, who are quite healthy. Coconut oil will boost HDL, the so-called good cholesterol.

The coconut is the largest seed on earth. It takes 3 years to break the soil it is in, so that the seed can actually grow.

The three significant benefits of coconut oil are:

* Supports your brain. A significant part of coconut oil is what’s called MCTs, or medium chain triglycerides – a type of fat that turns into ketones. Your brain cells love ketones. Ketones protect the nerves and brain cells against stress. They’ve been shown to boost cognitive function and to help people with dementia as well as Alzheimer’s.
* It’s antibacterial and antimicrobial. Its 3 main fatty acids are caprylic, capril and lauric, and they’re responsible for these properties, along with being antifungal, anti-candida, anti- yeast and antiviral. Monolaural, the precursor to lauric acid, has the capacity to dismantle the fatty layer around certain viruses. So it’s beneficial for your immune system.
* Provides you with more energy, because MCT oil doesn’t require digestive enzymes. It gets absorbed directly into your body. You get fatty acids and ketones for fuel, which are much more efficient than glucose. You’ll get more of what’s called ATP, the body’s energy currency, than you do from carbs.

***

## Can I consume cream cheese on keto?

Yes, as long as it is organic and doesn’t have any added sugar.

***

## Can I consume flaxseed oil on keto?

Not really. It is a highly refined product and is not recommended on keto.

Although flax seeds are loaded with omega-3, ligands, fiber, B1, etc. the problem is that flax has enzymes and enzyme inhibitors that prevent the absorption of nutrients. If you consume sprouted flax, you will absorb nutrients much better.

***

## Can I consume green apples on keto?

No. If you look up the nutritional profile of an apple, this is what you’ll find:

* Saturated fats – .1 g
* Cholesterol – 0 g
* Carbohydrates – 25 g
* Fiber – 44 g
* Sugar – 19 g

Apples have enough sugar to stop fat burning for at least one to two days. At least until you’re at your ideal weight, consuming apples (or any fruit) is probably not a good idea.

What should you snack on? You actually shouldn’t snack at all. Any time you eat, especially sugar, you spike insulin. In the presence of insulin, you can’t burn fat. It’s good to keep insulin very low. If you can’t go without snacking, you need to increase the amount of fat you consume in your meal. Fat helps keep you satisfied and helps keep insulin low.

***

## Can I consume green tea on keto?

Yes! Green tea has phytochemicals, plant-based chemicals that give unique health properties – ones that go beyond vitamins and minerals.

Benefits:

* Anti-cancer effects
* Anti-inflammatory effects
* Anti-radiation effects
* Cardiovascular support
* Blood sugar stability
* Blood pressure help
* Cholesterol balance
* Weight loss support

***

## Can I consume high-fructose syrup?

**If you follow keto and an intermittent fasting plan – no.**

The problem with high-fructose corn syrup is that it is 53% glucose and 42% fructose–the rest is composed of different types of sugars. The fructose can do some serious damage to the liver. All of your cells have receptors for glucose, but not fructose. Only your liver can break down fructose. If you consume a lot of fructose, you can overload the liver and create all sorts of health problems.

High fructose corn syrup is also made in a lab with cornstarch. Corn is GMO, so you’re getting that added glyphosate.

Thankfully, high-fructose corn syrup and even sugar are becoming less popular. This may have something to do with the awareness caused by the keto diet.

***

## Can I consume Italian dressing while on keto?

Often the salad dressings at the store, even if they’re organic, contain GMO soy, GMO corn oil, MSG and sugar. It’s really best to make your own salad dressings.

This recipe for homemade Italian dressing can be used for salad and much more. It’s natural,

it’s keto-friendly, it’s easy, and best of all it’s really delicious.

**Homemade Italian Dressing Ingredients:**

1 cup olive (or avocado) oil 1⁄4 cup white vinegar

2 Tbsp red wine vinegar

1 Tbsp chopped garlic

2 Tbsp finely chopped onion

2 Tbsp finely chopped red bell pepper

1 tsp Dijon mustard

1 tsp salt

1⁄4 tsp oregano

1⁄4 tsp marjoram

a pinch of red pepper flakes

ground black pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

Combine all ingredients in a jar and shake. Refrigerate for several weeks.

## Can I consume lobsters on keto?

Yes. Lobsters are keto-friendly.

***

## Can I consume olives on a ketogenic diet?

Yes you can.

Features of olives:

* High in vitamin E, iron, copper and calcium
* Keto-friendly: 74% oleic acid (monounsaturated fat)
* 4% to 6% carbohydrates, fiber 70%, net carbs 1.5 g per 10 olives
* Phytonutrients: anti-inflammatory, anticancer, good for heart support and repairing liver damage

One of the drawbacks of olives is that they contain lectins, which are large protein molecules that are a defense mechanism in plants, nuts, seeds, etc. They can go into our bodies and create a lot of inflammation. The way to lessen lectins is through fermentation and most olives are fermented.

Olive leaf extract is a good remedy for viruses. It has antihistamine properties which are good for rhinitis or sinus congestion.

## Can I consume pineapples on keto?

No, they are high in sugar and carbs.

***

## Can I consume raisins on keto?

No, they are high in carbs and sugar.

***

## Can I consume Red Bull on keto?

No. In theory, energy drinks are supposed to help increase brain energy, exercise performance and endurance. However, most energy drinks will actually cause brain fog and reduce exercise performance – and the ingredients will deplete the cells.

The big problem with energy drinks is that the ingredients don’t give you real energy. These drinks are composed mostly of caffeine and sugar. Caffeine is not a fuel, it’s a stimulant. It makes you think you have energy, but really it’s just revving up your adrenal glands. There are also crazy amounts of sugar in energy drinks, which will later make you more tired and grumpy, and will make you want another energy drink. A lot of this sugar is not just glucose. It’s fructose.

These drinks also contain a lot of sodium and not enough potassium. You need to look for an energy drink that has all of the electrolytes, the electrically charged minerals that really do help to energize your cells. Potassium helps recharge the batteries in your cells. Magnesium feeds the mitochondria.

## Can I consume rice on keto?

**Not really. Different types of rice and their features:**

**White rice**

• No hull, no bran, no germ (pure carbohydrate)

• Glycemic index: 77

• It’s enriched with synthetic vitamins – B1, B2, B3, folic acid, iron

One of the problems with consuming white rice is that you’re at risk of potentially developing a condition called Beri Beri (vitamin B1 deficiency). This is a neurological disease that can create all sorts of problems with the nerves, pulse rate, memory and blood sugars.

**Brown rice**

• Has no hull

• Has bran and germ (less refined)

• Glycemic index: 68 Wild rice

• It has the hull, the bran and the germ

• It has a lot more nutrition than other rice types

• Glycemic index: 52

## Can I consume salt on keto?

Yes. Add Himalayan sea salt to your keto regime.

You need around 1 to 2 tsp of salt per day. This depends on your activity level. If you sweat a lot, this can increase your need for sodium. If you’re on keto, you want a bare minimum of 1 tsp of salt a day. This is because, as you lose fat, you also lose water weight and electrolytes. Salt is a vital electrolyte.

Himalayan salt is actually very different from standard sea salt. Here’s why. Although both Himalayan salt and sea salt have trace minerals, generic sea salt also has microplastics. One study found that 90% of sea salt products had small amounts of plastics. However, Himalayan salt has zero microplastics. Why? Himalayan salt is sourced from an ancient sea that existed before humans and pollution.

## Can I consume shrimp on keto?

Yes. Shellfish are among the most important foods that you should be eating on a ketogenic diet.

***

## Can I consume SlimFast products on keto?

The main issues with SlimFast products are:

1\. **Poor Ingredients**: They contain high-glycemic sugars (maltodextrin, dextrose), GMOs (soy, canola oil, beet sugar), synthetic vitamins, and caffeine, which aren't suitable for a ketogenic diet.

2\. **Snack-Based**: These products are marketed as snacks, leading to frequent blood sugar spikes that hinder weight loss and are incompatible with intermittent fasting.

3\. **Lack of Integrity**: SlimFast still produces products with high sugar content (18g per serving), which contradicts their mission to improve health during an ongoing sugar consumption epidemic.

Overall, SlimFast seems to be capitalizing on market trends for profit, rather than genuinely promoting health.

## Can I do Keto and Intermittent Fasting if I'm a diabetic on metformin and insulin?

Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, both conditions involve high blood sugar and insulin. Metformin makes insulin receptors more responsive, while insulin replaces what the pancreas lacks. In type 1 diabetes, insulin is used to control unstable blood sugars, often resulting in high insulin levels. High insulin is more dangerous than high sugar, as it can damage the retina, kidneys, arteries, and brain. The goal is to minimize insulin use. For type 1 diabetes, despite potentially irreversibly damaged beta cells, it's crucial to reduce insulin use by focusing on diet and intermittent fasting to lower carb intake and improve insulin resistance. Work with your doctor to adjust medications accordingly.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Can I do keto even if I don’t like vegetables?

Not healthily, and here’s why.

The problem is that you will be burning a lot of fat, and you need to keep the fat going through the liver and gallbladder. Vegetables are going to provide you with needed nutrients and they are going to help organs like the liver to work better.

Dr. Berg recommends 7 to 10 cups of vegetables a day. Without vegetables it will be hard to flush out those organs.

If you aren’t in love with veggies you can try kale shakes with added berries to hide the taste, or take wheatgrass juice; you can use dips, fermented veggies, green powders, food concentrates, steamed spinach with protein, etc.

Health benefits from consuming a lot of vegetables will support your body while in ketosis and will prevent any potential keto side effects.

## Can I do keto if I have an allergy to nutritional yeast and nuts?

For individuals with allergies to nutritional yeast and nuts, it is still possible to pursue a ketogenic diet, though careful consideration of food choices is necessary. For those looking to increase their intake of vitamin B1, sunflower seeds may serve as a suitable alternative, provided there are no allergies to them.

While some individuals experience sensitivities to nuts, soaking them in water for 24 hours and subsequently drying them in an oven or dehydrator may help reduce enzyme inhibitors, potentially enhancing their digestibility. However, for those who cannot consume nutritional yeast, this does limit their options for obtaining certain nutrients. It is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to tailor a ketogenic plan that accommodates dietary restrictions while ensuring adequate nutrient intake.

## Can I drink alcohol on a ketogenic diet?

It’s not recommended. A lot of people think that alcohol is keto-friendly. They say “I drink hard liquor like whiskey, vodka, brandy, tequila, a dry martini – alcohol has no carbs, it has antioxidants and doesn’t turn to sugar, etc. so it’s okay, right?”

Most people do not drink pure ethanol. They consume beer, wine, mixed drinks and coolers that have added carbs.

Alcohol has 7 calories/gram and carbohydrates have 4 calories/gram. These calories have to go somewhere. Despite the fact that alcohol doesn’t turn into sugar or raise your insulin, the alcohol calories will turn into fat. Within one minute, alcohol is already in your bloodstream, up to your brain and to your liver.

Alcohol is a solvent. Your liver considers it to be a toxin. In the liver you have this enzyme that breaks alcohol down into a highly toxic chemical called acetaldehyde. It acts as a poison, killing brain cells and liver cells, causing oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis – and it leads to a fatty liver that is difficult, even impossible, to reverse.

Alcohol depletes your vitamins, dehydrates you, and blocks fat burning. Additionally, ethanol takes priority over burning fat. The liver focuses on ridding the body of alcohol instead.

There are no health benefits to drinking. It actually increases death. If you are okay with these risks, and understand that alcohol will also slow your weight-loss progress, then at least do not drink frequently, and do things to make up for the damage.

If you need a healthy alcohol substitute, you can consume kombucha tea.

***

## Can I drink beer on Keto?

Beer is very keto-unfriendly. When you consume beer, you deplete your nutrients, including:

***

## Can I eat apples on keto?

No, if you are on keto. Apples are high in carbs and sugar.

Apples content

* Saturated fats – .1 g
* Cholesterol – 0 g
* Carbohydrates – 25 g
* Fiber – 44 g
* Sugar – 19 g

Apples have enough sugar to stop fat burning for at least one to two days. At least until you’re at your ideal weight, consuming apples (or any fruit) is probably not a good idea.

***

## Can I eat bananas on keto?

No, due to high sugar and fat content.

Many people think that bananas are the best source of potassium. Although bananas do have some potassium, you would have to consume 12 bananas, on average, to get the amount of potassium that your body needs on a daily basis.

We need about 4700 mg of potassium each day and bananas only have between 300 and 400 mg. To put this amount of potassium in perspective, that would be 7 to 10 cups of salad per day.

***

## Can I eat cauliflower on Keto?

What’s cool about cauliflower is that its low carb, and it tastes like a potato! It seems like a starchy food but without the starch. One cup has 2.6 grams of carbs, but 1.4 grams of fiber makes it a net carb amount of 1.2 grams.

Besides being low carb, cauliflower has a lot of vitamins, especially B vitamins and vitamin C, vitamin E, and vitamin K1. It also has many minerals and trace minerals, especially manganese which is a great antioxidant. But that’s not all. Cauliflower has some serious amounts of phytonutrients (as do all cruciferous vegetables). Phytonutrients act as specialized antioxidants that help with turning certain genes on and off, as well as the maintenance of your DNA.

Keep in mind that the longer you cook cauliflower, the more you destroy its nutrients. 3 minutes of boiling, for example, equals ten minutes of steaming. So steam it for just 5 minutes; but, the way I recommend is to saute it. Ultimately, even if you cook it for a relatively long time, you still get the benefits of cauliflower being a low-carb food along with its fiber. Sometimes when I go to a restaurant I find they have the entire head of cauliflower roasted with cheese on it! And I pretty much eat the whole thing. Cauliflower truly is the ultimate keto food!

Make sure it is wild-caught (Pacific) and not farm-raised (Atlantic), because the chronic consumption of farm-raised salmon has been proven to dramatically increase visceral fat, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. It has been detected that pesticides, dioxins, and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls, which are highly toxic industrial compounds) in farm-raised salmon were the cause.

Also, an important point is that salmon has a good amount of selenium, a trace mineral involved in the key enzymes that detoxify heavy metals – including mercury. Selenium-based enzymes protect the brain and nervous system.

However, spinach has oxalates, which can cause kidney stones.

To counter oxalates, you can steam your spinach, you can add lemon juice and potassium citrate. You can also consume some calcium-rich food together with the spinach (in the same meal, not separately); this will allow calcium to bind with oxalates in your digestive system so they are prevented from forming stones in the kidneys.

Make sure spinach is organic to avoid unwanted chemicals.

## Can I eat wasabi on keto?

Yes. Wasabi has various phytonutrients that, when combined either by grating, shredding, or crushing the plant, stimulate a very special phytonutrient in the plant called isocyanates, which is responsible for the pungent taste of mustard, radish, horseradish, and wasabi. This phytonutrient is 3,000 times more concentrated in wasabi than cabbage and may have anticancer effects.

Potential health benefits of wasabi:

• May have anti-cancer effects

• Has potent antimicrobial properties

• Can support the cardiovascular system

• Can support the respiratory system

• Has anti-inflammatory effects

• A powerful antioxidant

• Can help thin mucus

You should know that true wasabi is very hard to grow and is very expensive. Most wasabi available is fake. 95% of the wasabi sold at sushi restaurants is made from other ingredients – not wasabi. They use either green food coloring or spinach juice to give it the green color.

***

## Can I eat watermelons on keto?

Yes, in small amounts.

There are two factors you need to know. One is the glycemic index, which is the speed at which your blood sugars are elevated after you eat the food item. The second is the glycemic load, which is a measurement of the quantity of carbohydrate in a given food.

A glycemic load of less than ten is on the low side. Watermelon is four, which is good. But its glycemic index is fairly high at 72. If you consume larger amounts of watermelon (or any food) the glycemic load multiplies. If you eat a small amount of watermelon on a keto diet, you’ll be okay as long as you keep within your net carbs.

If your metabolism is really slow, you want to avoid watermelon and even berries. But if your metabolism is good, you’ll be fine with a little bit of watermelon.

***

## Can I eat yogurt on keto?

The problem with most yogurt is that the sugar content is way too high. But you can find some low-carb yogurts as well. Be careful with dairy in general especially if it’s not organic and non-grass-fed because non-organic dairy can contain a lot of hormones.

***

## Can I eat zucchini on keto?

Yes, it has less than 3 carbs per cup.

***

## Can I follow the keto diet if I’m prone to kidney stones?

Number one, you have to keep your fluids a little higher because you're gonna lose a lot of fluid on the ketogenic diet, right? So we want to keep the fluids to at least two and a half liters of fluid a day, and then you'll be good.

The most common type of kidney stone is the oxalate version, and so making sure that your urine is acidic would be a smart thing, okay? Because when you become too alkaline, that's when you can start developing more stones. But if you have a uric acid stone, you want to do the opposite, and you want to alkalize the body.

And then one last point. Make sure that you avoid spinach, almonds, chocolate, because they're very high in oxalates.

***

## Can I gain weight from antibiotics?

Yes, antibiotics can contribute to weight gain. You have approximately 1,000 trillion microbes living in and on your body. When antibiotics eliminate beneficial bacteria, it can increase hunger, lead to cravings for unhealthy foods, and cause inflammation. This inflammation can then result in insulin resistance and subsequent weight gain.

***

## Can I get rid of kidney stones on keto?

The ketogenic diet itself doesn't directly counter kidney stones, but certain remedies can help prevent them:

1\. Phytic acid can prevent calcium crystallization, a common cause of kidney stones. Increase intake by consuming moderate protein and plenty of vegetables.

2\. Take vitamin C to bind with calcium and prevent stone formation.

3\. Stay hydrated and add electrolytes to your fluids, especially if sedentary.

4\. Drink lemon water and ensure adequate intake of vitamin B6 and calcium-rich foods like grass-fed dairy.

5\. Consider calcium orotate as a supplement, as it may reduce calcium buildup in the kidneys.

6\. Address magnesium deficiency, but if consuming ample vegetables, additional supplementation may not be necessary.

If you've strayed from the keto plan, simply resume it along with intermittent fasting. Gradually transition into ketosis, reduce snacking, and supplement with potassium, sodium, and nutritional yeast. Additionally, take the opportunity to deepen your understanding of the ketogenic diet to enhance self-control and success.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Can I still eat ice cream and do a Ketogenic diet?

The answer is yes/no. Regular ice cream contains a lot of sugar and carbs which can spike your insulin levels, and it will kick you out of Ketosis. However, there are a lot of Keto version ice creams on the market. You will need to look for ice creams where carb levels are low and in which sugar substitutes are used like erythritol, stevia, etc.

## Can I take branched chain amino acids on Keto and IF while exercising?

This will spike insulin, but it's a minor point since the insulin spike is small. The real question is WHY are you taking it in the first place.

If you are taking it for recovery, then realize that those amino acids take several hours before they are turned into protein and you would be much better off taking B-vitamins (nutritional yeast) and minerals (electrolytes), since they are the cofactors or helps in the repair of muscles and the creation (synthesis) of muscle.

If you are taking BCAA to build muscle realize that intermittent fasting, in general, will already give you a protein-sparing effect and this protects you from the loss of protein. Growth hormones are spiked too, which helps with this.

Autophagy also occurs which is the recycling of proteins from the cell, thus reducing the need for taking extra protein.

I’m not recommending taking melatonin–unless you are using it for a specific condition. Your body can make its own melatonin naturally.

It’s true that your melatonin levels will drop with age, but you can support them through your diet and other lifestyle choices.

Here’s how you can improve your melatonin levels:

* Avoid light at night
* Get plenty of sun and vitamin D during the day
* Decrease your exposure to blue light in the evening
* Avoid eating before bed
* Get your glucose under control (low-carb keto diet!)
* Avoid TV before bed

The best foods for improving melatonin are mushrooms, eggs, fish and nuts.

## Can I use balsamic dressing for my salad?

Most salad dressings are filled with GMO soy, corn oil, sugar and MSG. Even some of the salad dressings that are advertised as healthy or organic may have some of these things.

You can make balsamic dressing yourself though. This is an incredibly easy recipe, it’s super healthy, and you might really enjoy it.

Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing Ingredients:

1⁄4 cup balsamic vinegar 3⁄4 cup olive oil 1 Tbsp chopped garlic 1 Tbsp Dijon mustard salt and pepper to taste

(suggestion: add 2 tsp of roasted sesame seeds!) Instructions:

Mix all ingredients in a jar and shake well. Refrigerate. This will last for several weeks.

## Can I use cassava flour on keto?

No. Cassava is very high in carbohydrates. It’s also very high on the glycemic index. Cassava is a starch – a root vegetable. It’s not keto-friendly. Cassava is also used to make tapioca, which is not keto-friendly, either. Another name for cassava is yuca. Cassava or yuca are not keto- friendly.

Cassava also contains very small amounts of vitamin B1 (thiamine). This is a problem because any time you have something with a lot of carbs and low vitamin B1, you can create a vitamin B1 deficiency. This happens because you use up vitamin B1 to metabolize carbs.

## Can keto burn fat?

Of course! As long as you do it correctly.

***

## Can Keto cause diarrhea?

Diarrhea on a ketogenic diet can occur for several reasons. One common cause is that your body may not be accustomed to digesting the higher levels of saturated fat required on keto. To address this, consider reducing your intake of oils such as MCT oil, butter, and coconut oil to see if symptoms improve.

Additionally, excessive consumption of certain vegetables can overwhelm gut microbes. It's advisable to stick to more easily digestible options like lettuce, cucumber, tomato, and bell pepper, gradually reintroducing other vegetables as your gut adapts. Incorporating fermented vegetables can also support gut health.

With time and appropriate dietary adjustments, diarrhea should subside as your body adapts to the ketogenic diet.

***

## Can keto cause high blood pressure?

No, providing you are following a healthy version, or the Healthy Keto® diet. Healthy Keto should actually improve it.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

***

## Can keto improve borderline hypothyroidism?

Adopting a ketogenic diet can significantly benefit your thyroid and overall endocrine system. High-carb diets increase insulin levels, leading to insulin resistance, which can severely impact the thyroid and other endocrine functions. Some people believe they can't follow a keto diet due to conditions like diabetes or Hashimoto's, but these are actually reasons to consider it. Keto can reduce inflammation, which is particularly beneficial for autoimmune thyroid disorders. Therefore, implementing a ketogenic diet may improve your situation.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

***

## Can Ketogenic diet cause an allergic reaction to wheat and gluten?

No, it's not going to create an allergy. You're going to be aware of the allergy more because as you clean up your diet some of these other things are going to show up more before it might've you just been numb to it. The other thing too is with the wheat and stuff is that it actually has a morphine effect so it can numb you. And so now you clean up your diet and then you go back to it and you might notice it more because you don't have all these other factors triggering it.

## Can older people do keto?

Of course! This will support their health and longevity. It’s recommended that they start it very gradually to avoid any keto-adaptation side effects. Watch some of Dr. Berg’s videos on keto to learn how to do it correctly.

***

## Can the ketogenic diet have an impact on thyroid function?

When following a well-structured and healthy ketogenic diet, thyroid function is generally not compromised. In fact, a properly implemented ketogenic approach can enhance metabolic efficiency, potentially reducing the need for higher levels of thyroid hormones. While you may observe slight decreases in T4 or T3 levels, these fluctuations typically remain within the normal range.

Hypothyroidism is commonly diagnosed through measurements of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is regulated by the pituitary gland. TSH levels are likely to remain stable when following a nutritious, low-carbohydrate diet. Therefore, there is usually no cause for concern regarding thyroid function while adhering to a healthy ketogenic lifestyle. If you have specific concerns about your thyroid health, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

## Can the ketogenic diet lead to feelings of fatigue?

It can, during the transition period or if you do it incorrectly. It can mean:

* You need more B vitamins (especially B1 and B5) – these 2 vitamins are crucial in the metabolism and the ability to make energy
* A need to increase potassium (eat large quantities of vegetables)
* Deficiency of stomach acids (apple cider vinegar, sea salt, betaine hydrochloride )
* Hidden carbohydrates in your food
* Decreased blood sugars (feeling tired)
* High blood sugar (tired after eating)
* Need for more sleep

There might be other reasons behind tiredness that are not keto-related. It could be connected to digestion, or stress or inflammation, for example. Try to handle the root cause while following a Healthy Keto® plan.

***

## Can the Ketogenic Diet spike cortisol?

Insulin resistance is a situation where the body compensate the excess carb and sugar in the diet and it is protecting itself against it. When you have higher insulin, it is going to push the blood sugars on the lower side.

**Functions of Cortisol:**

1\. Protect against hypoglycemia or low blood sugar.

2\. It stimulates Gluconeogenesis.

## Can you drink sheep milk on keto?

No. Sheep milk contains 13 grams of carbohydrates per cup, which can easily kick you out of ketosis. To remain in ketosis, keep your carbohydrate consumption between 20 and 50 grams per day.

***

## Can you eat as much as you want on keto?

A keto diet does not necessarily say how large you should make the meals you consume. It is recommended, though, that you consume enough to feel satisfied.

If you eat too much and snack often, even using keto-friendly ingredients, you will slow down your weight loss, as your insulin will be high. For the best results, it’s recommended that you follow the Healthy Keto® diet with an intermittent fasting plan.

## Can you eat Rice Cakes on a no-carb diet?

Rice cakes should not be eaten on a no-carb diet as they contain around 7-9 grams of carbohydrates per cake.

***

## Can you eat seeds and nuts on Keto diet?

**Let’s take a look at the best nuts and seeds on keto:**

1\. Macadamia nuts (get them fresh—they go rancid!)

2\. Pecans

3\. Walnuts

4\. Cashews (but only in small amounts!)

5\. Chia seeds

6\. Flax seeds

7\. Hemp seeds

8\. Sunflower seeds

**Worst nuts and seeds on keto:**

1\. Peanuts

2\. Peanut butter (unless no added sugar or MSG)

3\. Cashews in large quantities (too many carbs)

4\. Any nut butter with added sugars You want to stick to 2-3 oz of nuts and seeds per meal. Any more can cause gallbladder irritation and right shoulder pain.

## Can you share tips, because I think I am doing something wrong on keto?

Here are some key tips for navigating the ketogenic diet: First, seek out substitutes for foods you enjoy but can't have on keto to satisfy cravings. Consistency is crucial, so aim to stick to the diet for as long as possible and work on strengthening your self-control. Opt for nutrient-dense foods and prioritize Healthy Keto® over dirty keto to ensure you're getting essential nutrients. Consider supplementing with B vitamins, electrolytes, and other necessary nutrients to support your body during keto and fasting. Additionally, incorporating bile salts can aid in digestion and nutrient absorption.

## Cauliflower "Non-Potato" Pancakes Recipe

One of the biggest comfort foods for Karen growing up in Pennsylvania was potato pancakes. She really wanted to find a low-carb alternative to potato pancakes, and cauliflower works perfectly.

This is a really easy recipe. You don't have to steam the cauliflower, you just mix up the ingredients, and it fries up really nicely. We love to make them in a cast iron pan and serve them warm with sour cream. This is another great recipe to help you get plenty of cruciferous. I think you're really going to love it.

**Cauliflower 'Non-potato' Pancakes**

**Ingredients:**

* 1 cup shredded cauliflower
* ½ cup shredded mozzarella
* 1 egg (If small, use 2.)
* ¼ cup almond flour
* ¼ cup finely chopped onion
* 1 tbl parsley
* 1 tsp salt,
* ½ tsp pepper

**Directions:**

* Mix all ingredients.
* Heat skillet and add oil until hot. I love the cast iron skillet for this.
* Drop a mound in the hot pan (about ¼ cup) and press down gently. Let one side become fully brown before turning. Brown second side.
* Move to a plate with a paper towel to remove excess oil.
* You may want a little more salt on top.
* Serve warm with a dollop of sour cream.

These are AMAZING!!!

## Chocolate Chia Pudding Recipe

This is another great recipe made with chia seeds. Chia seeds are very nutritious, and it's always great to find new delicious ways to include them in your diet. They are packed with omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids. These fatty acids are especially good for dry skin.

We like this homemade chocolate chia pudding with a lot of chocolate. You can play around with the amount of cocoa powder you put in it to make it more or less "chocolatey." This is a fantastic, easy, and healthy chocolate pudding. Give it a try!

Remember, if you're on the healthy keto diet, this is a perfect little keto dessert—not a snack.

Chocolate Chia Pudding Recipe:

**Ingredients:**

30oz almond/coconut milk (or your favorite)

1 tbsp cocoa powder (less if you like milkier chocolate)

½ cup chia seed (or more for thicker texture)

¼ tsp chocolate stevia (The more cocoa you use, the more stevia you'll need.)

1 quart mason jar

**Directions:**

Pour milk into the mason jar, leaving about an inch of room at the top.

Add cocoa powder and stevia.

Put on top and shake vigorously to mix the cocoa.

Add chia seed and immediately put on top and shake.

Leave on its side on counter or in fridge for about 10 minutes, and shake again.

Any cocoa clumps will be breaking down and you need to mix the chia with a good shake.

Then put in fridge for a few hours to thicken. Enjoy!

## Do I have to exercise to get results on keto?

It is not a must, but it is recommended that you exercise on a keto diet.

Diet contributes to 85% of your progress with weight loss and 15% comes from exercise.

You can see that exercise is a small percentage that does have benefits to help you hit your goal. However, it has many other benefits as well.

## Do I really need carbs for healthy living?

All your life you've been told that you need carbohydrates for energy or that your brain can only run on glucose made from carbs, a type of sugar. That is a myth, as evidenced by the countless healthy, happy individuals on low-sugar or low-carbohydrate diets. Instead, you can run your body on other fuel sources, such as fatty acids and ketones produced by fat-burning. While your body does need a very tiny amount of glucose (sugar) to function, it can produce all the glucose it needs internally from fat or protein, not carbs. For more information, watch this video:

## Do Rice Cakes contain bad carbs?

Rice cakes contain simple carbohydrates that can cause a spike in blood sugar levels, making them less ideal for weight loss and overall health. They also lack essential nutrients and fiber.

***

## Do the same rules of Keto apply to a type 1 diabetic?

I just interviewed someone on this one topic. But he was a fascinating interview, this doctor who actually not, not only was he a type one diabetic, but he ran 20 miles five days in a row and on no calories. He fasted for five days and he did fine.

**So the same rules apply, same rules apply. There's all this false information that we need more carbs if we're a type one diabetic for some reason, but then you're going to just take more insulin. The whole goal is to take the least amount of insulin because that extra insulin creates more problems.**

So yeah, it's the same, same rules. But of course, because you don't have insulin, then you have no way of controlling your carbs when you eat. So you have to monitor that level.

**And there's one condition with type one diabetes that we should bring up. It's called diabetic ketoacidosis.** And that's a situation where you forget to take your insulin and you're a type one and your ketones are out of control.They go way, way, way too high. But that condition is not going to occur if you control your blood sugars with your medication. And it's definitely not going to occur if you're not a diabetic.

## Do women need more carbs on a keto and intermittent fasting plan?

No. It’s the same for men and women.

***

## Do you feel lightheaded on Keto and IF?

The reason is a low blood volume and pressure issue so now that you not retaining fluid from the carbs any longer the new way to keep the fluid is to add sea salt to your water. Make sure you keep taking your potassium and electrolytes then the lightheaded feeling will go away.

***

## Does alcohol increase ketosis on a Ketogenic Diet?

No, alcohol doesn’t increase ketosis. In fact, drinking alcohol inhibits your body’s ability to burn fat and generate ketones, and even small amounts of alcoholic beverages can affect ketosis.

***

## Does brain need to adapt to ketosis too?

**The brain has the capacity to run on ketones immediately. It even prefers ketones as its fuel source.**

• 1/3 of the brain will always run on glucose, but 2/3 of the brain runs on ketones.

• 23% of all the energy that is generated is used by the brain.

**Sources of ketones:**

1\. Endogenous ketones – Meaning the body can make them if you lower your carbohydrates.

2\. Exogenous ketones – Meaning ketones outside of the body like ketone salts and MCT oil.

Your blood ketone level is what determines how many ketones are in the brain—this level should be high. Your blood ketone level is determined by your insulin and glucose levels. Your insulin levels should be on the low side of the normal range, and your glucose levels need to be low.

The more ketones you have in the blood, the better and faster the brain will be able to use them. The brain does not need time to keto adapt. Still, you can assist this process and prevent brain fog or keto fatigue by taking ketones or MCT oil.

Another situation where it would be a good idea to start taking exogenous ketones is if you need to improve brain function or improve memory. For example, in cases where you have memory problems or even Alzheimer’s.

**Parts of the brain that use ketones:**

1\. Cerebral Cortex

2\. Hypothalamus

3\. Pituitary Gland

4\. Pineal Gland

***

## Does drinking alcohol kick you out of Ketosis?

Yes, drinking alcohol can kick you out of ketosis. Your body perceives ethanol as a poison, and your liver prioritizes alcohol detoxification which stops your metabolism from converting fatty acids into ketones. And, what’s more, alcohol can trigger powerful carb cravings, and you may find it hard to resist enticing carb-rich foods while under the influence.

***

## Does fat put me in ketosis on keto?

Many people think it takes consuming more fat to put your body into the state of ketosis.

The truth is, you don’t necessarily need to consume more fat. Instead, you need to lower your carbohydrates. Carbs affect insulin, and insulin blocks ketosis. The key is to lower your carbs.

Ketosis is also not a high-protein diet. You want to consume only a moderate amount of protein. 3-8 oz of protein is fine. You also don’t want to consume lean protein—low-fat protein can exacerbate insulin spikes. Always consume full-fat foods.

***

## Does gluten-free count as Keto?

I believe gluten is harmful, and a person should try to avoid it. However, just because something is gluten-free, this doesn’t mean it’s not going to raise your insulin.

For example, grains like wheat might be gluten-free, but it’s still going to affect your blood sugars. Gluten-free grains are better, in my opinion, than grains with gluten. But, it’s important to consume a low-carb diet (20-50g of carbs per day). A person could consume gluten-free grains in small amounts as long as they stick to only having 20-50g of carbs per day.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/is-gluten-free-okay-on-a-ketogenic-diet-drberg-on-gluten-free-foods-on-a-keto-diet)

***

## Does keto cause headaches?

The phrenic nerve goes underneath the diaphragm on the right and left sides and it extends all the way up to the neck and head. On the right side, the phrenic nerve is very close to the gallbladder. If there is any type of congestion with the gallbladder, or bloating, it will put pressure on that nerve. So, if you have a headache on the right side of your head or neck pain on the right side, it could be related to the gallbladder.

When you’re on a ketogenic diet, you’re going to be consuming more fats. When you consume more fats, your body has to adapt to digesting them. You have to have enough bile for the process of digesting the fats. So your gallbladder could be a little overloaded – causing a headache. But it usually goes away pretty fast as your body adjusts to the fat-burning.

***

## Does Keto diet make you gassy?

Keto itself should not cause gas, but you may have preexisting gastrointestinal problems that do cause it.

Colon cells have “roots” that absorb the nutrients passing through the intestines. If you have pre-existing problems with your colon cells, they wouldn’t absorb nutrients and that would prevent the combination of certain enzymes with food particles to break down the food for absorption into the cells. You could end up having undigested food particles in the intestines. The undigested food then would either rot or ferment, causing gases.

Sources of this problem:

* Antibiotics – destroy some of your body’s microbes and cause the body to make more of the unfriendly microbes
* Antacids – when you lose the acidity of the stomach and as you age, you lose the stomach acids
* Junk food
* Small intestines (overgrowth of bacteria entering small intestines can cause gases)

Recommendation:

* Adjust the type of fiber that you consume
* Adjust the quantity of fiber – start with small amounts and gradually increase over time.

***

## Does Keto help with candida infection?

A few symptoms of Candida are achiness of joints, fatigue, itchiness of the body, and digestive issues just to name a few. You want to stay away from sugar, birth control pills can accelerate it as well as stress.

Doing intermittent fasting for at least 18 hours or more will put your body in an autophagy state in which the body would eliminate yeast, mold, fungus, and candida. Adding Thyme oil, grapefruit, and seed extract can help with the healing process.

## Does keto make your pee smell?

It can, during the keto adaptation period.

If you are on a keto diet, the smell usually comes from the ketones that aren’t being burned. This often happens if you’re still adapting to keto. Keto adaptation can take several weeks. Over time, you will burn those ketones and they won’t cause an odor.

If you are not on a ketogenic diet and you’re not doing intermittent fasting, but you’re getting a stinky urine odor, it could be a urinary tract infection, liver damage, eating the wrong foods, or not having enough vegetables.

Here’s what you can do for a strong urine odor:

* Liver support – consume plenty of healthy vegetables (like beet tops and dandelion greens)
* Fluids – drink plenty of water throughout the day
* Adjust proteins – lower your protein (3 to 6 oz is plenty)
* Chlorophyll – wheatgrass juice powder is a great source of it

***

## Does keto require you to eat a lot of fat to lose weight?

You would consume more fat than usual on the ketogenic diet, compared to the standard American diet.

On average, you would have to get about 70% of your calories from fat. Healthy fats allow you to remain satisfied until your next meal and will support your body with needed fat-soluble vitamins.

On average, consume 20 to 40 g of fat every meal. This will supply you with needed nutrients and calories so it’s easier to keep winning with the keto regime.

***

## Does Ketogenic diet increase or decrease heart disease?

One of the main causes of heart disease is high insulin, and the ketogenic diet is designed to lower insulin. To take it to the next level and lower your insulin, even more, you may want to also do intermittent fasting.

## Does looking at sweets spike your insulin?

**The answer is no – not in a fasting state.** Looking at sweets and carbs will not cause an insulin spike. The primary triggers of blood sugar are glucose and things that turn into glucose. But, anything you eat has the potential to trigger insulin just for the fact that you ate it. If it’s more carbohydrate, it will trigger your blood sugar more. If it’s less carbohydrate and more fat, it will trigger your blood sugar less.

**Chronic high insulin can lead to insulin resistance. Other triggers that can cause a blood sugar spike:**

• Cortisol – Stress

• GIP

• Protein – especially if it’s low fat

**Common symptoms of insulin resistance**

1\. Can’t go long without eating

2\. Not satisfied

3\. Cravings

4\. Need for snacks

***

## Does stress affect my weight loss on keto?

Stress may actually prevent ketosis. When you spike cortisol, which is a stress hormone, you could start to break down your protein and turn it into glucose.

Basically, when you have a lot of stress, your blood sugars rise, which will cause insulin to spike to lower the elevated blood sugar.

Over time, this could create insulin resistance, which could lead to diabetes. Synthetic cortisol, like prednisone, may have the same effect.

**What may help:**

* Start increasing your exercise
* Consume vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast)
* Consume potassium (vegetables)
* Consume magnesium (vegetables)
* You can also get Dr. Berg’s Adrenal & Cortisol Support supplement
* You can also get Dr. Berg’s Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula supplement

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Does the keto diet raise cholesterol?

It may temporarily increase cholesterol.

This is an oversimplified talk and for more detailed data see Dr. Eric Berg’s video on LDL. However, as your fat cells shrink, the fat cell not only releases triglycerides, but cholesterol too. Many people do not know that fat cells are filled with both. The excess cholesterol either has to be eliminated through the liver and gallbladder (bile) or be recycled. This is all a normal process in ketosis; therefore it may increase cholesterol, but it’s a temporary effect.

As the fat cell shrinks, you can burn the triglycerides for fuel but you cannot burn the cholesterol because it is not a fuel source. It is going to be eliminated as you lose weight. As the fat cell is squeezed, the cholesterol is going to increase in the blood and is going to go into the liver and come out with the bile. As long as your liver is healthy and you’re eating a lot of vegetables, and as long as you have enough bile, you are totally fine even if your LDL is high.

The key thing is to make sure that your triglycerides are low because if you are not using your triglycerides as a fuel then there is a problem – you are probably eating too much sugar. When you are on a ketogenic diet and you are doing it correctly, and your triglycerides are low and your HDL and LDL are high, all that means is that you are burning more LDL and there are no bad effects that are going to happen. Just keep your vegetables high and as you come closer to your weight-loss goal, that will level out and come back to normal.

## Does the ketogenic diet result in a loss of muscle tone?

If implemented correctly, the ketogenic diet should not result in a loss of muscle tone. However, muscle loss can occur if the diet is not followed properly, particularly in conjunction with inadequate nutrition. For instance, if one engages in prolonged fasting, such as eating only every third day, muscle mass may be affected unless sufficient amino acids are consumed over time.

The most significant factor in maintaining muscle mass is regular exercise, which serves as a potent stimulus for muscle growth. As long as you are consuming adequate amino acids, engaging in consistent physical activity, and ensuring a well-rounded intake of essential nutrients, you should not experience muscle loss. Conversely, adopting a "dirty keto" approach, combined with improper fasting and lack of exercise, can lead to muscle degradation. Therefore, it is crucial to follow a balanced diet and maintain an active lifestyle to preserve muscle tone while on a ketogenic diet.

If you're looking for a keto pie crust recipe that's not only nutritious but also delicious, you should give this a try. You can make this simple pie crust to go with sweet pies or a savory quiche. Check out one of my low-carb recipes below so you can make it at home with or without an occasion.

**My Keto Pie Crust Recipe:**

**Ingredients**

• 1 ½ cup almond flour

• ¼ tsp baking soda

• 1 ½ tbsp melted butter from grass-fed animals

• ¼ tsp salt

• 1 organic egg

• ¼ tsp vanilla

• 1 tbsp powdered sweetener (This is if the crust is used for the pie. If for the keto quiche, don't add sweetener or a sugar substitute.)

**Directions:**

1\. Preheat oven at 350 °F.

2\. Mix all ingredients in a food processor, not in a mixing bowl. Mix until it balls up. Dump the keto pie crust dough onto the pie plate and spread thin.

3\. The almond flour pie crust thickens, so you can press it quite thin.

4\. Bake the crust at 350 °F for 8-10 minutes.

5\. This can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days if made in advance.

## Fats or carbs - what do I crave on Keto?

Do you crave proteins, carbs, or fats? If you crave protein, it could be you need more recovery because you are exercising. Just make sure you do high-quality protein like eggs. If you crave fat, it could mean you need more fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K.

Vitamin E is important in muscle and female hormones, especially during menopause. If you crave more vegetables, it usually means you need more minerals or vitamins. It could mean you have a congestive gallbladder or liver. If you crave starch, then we know you have a blood sugar problem and you need to realize it will take more time.

## Fiber Supplements and Keto Diet Compatibility

### **Fiber Supplements and Keto Diet Compatibility**

If you're struggling to get enough fiber on a keto diet, consider a keto-friendly fiber supplement.

**Identifying Keto-Friendly Fiber Supplements**

**-** Look for low net carbs and high fiber options like:

\- Psyllium husk powder

\- Ground flaxseed

\- Chia seeds

\- Acacia fiber

**Impact on Weight Management**

\- Fiber supplements can aid weight loss by promoting fullness and reducing calorie intake.

\- Some may cause temporary water retention, but this isn't fat gain.

**Consult your healthcare provider to choose the right supplement and dosage for your needs.**

## Healthiest Keto Cookies

The recipe for the healthiest cookies in the world:

**Ingredients**:

8 ounces (2 sticks) of butter (Organic -- or my favorite; Kerrygold Irish Butter)

4 Tbs. of xylitol (sweetener) (get on amazon.com or at the health food store)

2 cups of almond flour

2 cups of crushed pecans

1 chocolate bar (3.5 ounces) -- must be diabetic chocolate (I like Simply Lite® -- from Trader Joes)

1 pinch of sea salt

2 tsp. of vanilla extract

**Where to get:**

**Kerrygold butter:** most grocery stores, but Trader Joes, BJs, and health food stores have it. But any European butter or organic butter will work.

**Almond Flour:** most health food stores or on amazon.com

**Pecans:** you can find them at any grocery store, but on amazon.com they are less expensive.

**Xylitol:** you can find it at the health food store or amazon.com

**Simply Lite Chocolate:** Trader Joes or online.

**Directions:**

* Preheat oven at 325. Leave butter out of the refrigerator overnight -- must be soft. Mix the butter (8 ounces) with the xylitol (4 Tbs) with a mixer (or by hand) until very smooth. For time sake, mix with fork until a smooth consistency.
* Crush the pecans (in grinder, food processor or in a bag with a rolling pin). Make sure it's 2 cups after crushing.
* Breakdown (or grind) the chocolate bar (3.5 ounces) in a food processor or other means.
* Mix thoroughly the now sweetened butter, almond flour (2 cups), crushed pecans (2 cups), crushed chocolate bar, pinch of sea salt, 2 Tsp of vanilla extract in a bowl. You could, as an option, have your food processor mix it instead.
* Form little balls with your hands and roll them in some almond flour (to coat them), putting them on a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
* Cook for 13 minutes at 325 degrees, then let them sit out of the oven for 10 minutes.
* Transfer to the freezer until frozen. Then store them in the refrigerator.

Enjoy!!!!!!!!

**Mistakes:**

1\. Let them completely cool down or they will crumble and disintegrate when you try to pick one up. I also put them in the freezer, make them solid and we're good to go. Consuming them cold and slightly frozen is much tastier than consuming them warm.

2\. I also found that using the "no sugar added" diabetic chocolate works better with milk chocolate, not dark chocolate.

3\. Almond flour works better than almond meal.

4\. I also found that if you substitute crushed pecans with crushed macadamia nuts or crushed cashews (same amounts), it will add a different flavor, be very rich, and also crazy delicious. If you do this, make sure you do not add that pinch of salt, because macadamia nuts and cashews may already come with salt.

5\. Using vanilla extract.

6\. Leave the butter out of the refrigerator overnight.

## Healthy Keto Diet for Healthy Teeth

### **Healthy Keto® Diet: A Delicious Way to Better Oral Health**

[The Heathy Keto® diet](https://www.drberg.com/the-healthy-keto-diet-for-beginners) can be a tasty solution to dental problems. Replacing sugary foods with nutrient-dense alternatives can improve oral health and protect against tooth decay.

#### **What Is A Healthy Keto Diet?**

A keto diet is a low-carb, high-fatdiet that can help with weight loss, diabetes control, and heart health. Lowering carbs and augmenting healthy fats leads to your body entering a ketogenic state.

A [Healthy Keto diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/healthy-keto-plan-start-here) emphasizes whole foods like vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats such as avocados and olive oil.

#### **Benefits Of A Healthy Keto Diet For Your Teeth**

* **Sugar Reduction:** A keto diet is low in sugar, which can help prevent cavities and gum disease. Bacteria in your mouth feed off sugar, producing acids that erode enamel and cause decay.
* **Balancing Your pH:** Limiting carbs can maintain a balanced pH level in your mouth, preventing bacterial growth and promoting healthier teeth and gums.
* **Nutrient-Rich Foods:** A healthy keto diet includes nutrient-rich foods like leafy greens, which provide essential vitamins and minerals for strong teeth and gums.

Switching to a keto lifestyle can be intimidating, yet proper meal planning and new recipes may prove both tasty and satisfying. Plus, the benefits extend beyond your teeth - you may experience increased energy, improved mood, and better concentration.

While natural remedies like clove oil can provide temporary relief, they should not replace regular dental visits and proper hygiene practices. By making mindful food choices, you can dramatically improve your oral health and reduce the need for short-term solutions.

## High-Carb Vs. Healthy Ketogenic Diet

### **High-Carb Vs. Healthy Ketogenic Diets**

A diet abundant in refined carbs can lead to a heightened need for vitamins B1 and C. This is because refining strips away much of their nutritional value, leaving you with empty calories that do little to nourish your body.

#### **Why Does Consuming Refined Carbs Increase Our Need For Vitamins?**

The more processed carbohydrates you take in, the harder your body has to work to break them down. This increased metabolic activity requires additional nutrients for support - hence the heightened need for vitamins such as B1 (thiamine) and C (ascorbic acid).

Thiamine is crucial in converting food into energy, while ascorbic acid helps protect cells from damage.

#### **Transitioning From Carb-heavy Meals To Balanced Ketogenic Plates**

A healthy ketogenic lifestyle is a diet focused on low-carb, high-fat foods that promote balanced nutrition without overloading your system with unnecessary sugars.

By reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with healthy fats, the keto diet puts your body into a metabolic state known as ketosis, where fat becomes its primary fuel source instead of glucose derived from carbohydrates.

This helps maintain steady blood sugar levels and reduces insulin resistance, promoting better nutrient absorption. To make transitioning easier, gradually reduce your carb intake while increasing healthy fats.

[Incorporate healthy fats into your diet](https://www.drberg.com/ketosis-approved-foods), such as avocados, nuts/seeds, and fatty fish, and include plenty of green leafy vegetables.

### **Conclusion**

Healthy Keto is excellent for weight loss and promotes overall health. A high-fat diet can lower the risk of insulin resistance, help balance hormonal levels, and promote digestive health.

## How can a pro athlete transition to keto and fasting safely without having the risk of kidney stones?

There's a couple of factors that make up the stone. One is the consumption of food that has a lot of oxalates in it. You want to avoid those foods. It's very high in almonds and almond flour. A lot of Keto products contain almonds or almond flour. Spinach also has high levels of oxalates. As well as chocolate and even sugar-free chocolate. Kiwis are also on the list. Try avoiding these foods.

But the other thing too, is that it's impossible to get a kidney stone unless there's a super concentrated urine in your bladder or your kidneys. One solution is to make sure you have at least two and a half liters of fluid a day.

***

## How can I address body odor while on Keto?

There are a few things that could cause an odor in your urine or breath, like:

* Liver damage
* Infection
* Dehydration
* Asparagus
* Too much protein

As you transition to keto and intermittent fasting your ketones are going to go up. There are three types of ketones, but the one that creates the most detectable odor on breath and in urine is acetone. If your urine is darker, cloudy, and has a strong odor chances are it’s going to be acetone (not the nail polish remover; that is different). Your sweat and breath can also have a strong odor as a result.

Your body actually makes acetone as a natural consequence of consuming more fat and less carbohydrate. It is a normal thing and not a concern at all.

To get rid of the odor, increase chlorophyll in your diet. It is a deodorizer that comes from leafy greens. Increase your fluids, and not just by drinking water, but using electrolytes with your water to become more hydrated.

Lastly, as long as you are consistent with your diet, the odor will go away as your body gets adapted to ketosis.

We also recommend trying Dr. Berg's Electrolytes Powder drink. This drink is a perfect keto-friendly beverage! Here is the link: [https://shop.drberg.com/electrolyte-powder-raspberry-lemon-100-servings](https://shop.drberg.com/electrolyte-powder-raspberry-lemon-100-servings)

## How can I adjust to incorporating more fat into my diet while on keto?

You may have started eating too much fat or added more too suddenly – more than your digestive system is used to. Cut back a little bit, and gradually increase it. Gallbladder or liver problems could cause difficulties with digesting fat as well.

Taking purified bile salts, choline, or lipase can help with fat digestion.

***

## How can I avoid keto side effects?

For common keto side effects:

\- Brain fog: Use nutritional yeast and MCT oil.

\- Gout/high uric acid: Consume green drinks and regulate pH.

\- High cholesterol: Increase bile salts intake.

\- Kidney stones: Ensure hydration and potassium citrate intake, avoid high-oxalate foods.

\- Digestion issues: Adjust vegetable intake, take bile salts, avoid lectins, and use betaine hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar.

\- Acne: Avoid dairy products.

\- Palpitations and muscle cramps: Increase magnesium, potassium, and sea salt.

\- Irritability: Increase vitamin B1 intake.

\- Gallbladder pain: Avoid nuts and peanut butter.

\- Bad breath: Increase leafy greens and lower protein.

\- Rash: Increase B vitamins with nutritional yeast.

\- Fatigue or keto flu: Increase sea salt and potassium.

\- Sleeplessness: Increase calcium intake with supplements and use more sea salt.

## How can I convince my kids to do Healthy Keto®?

It's challenging to break habits formed by exposure to sweets and sugars. One approach is to educate children continuously about healthy choices until it becomes ingrained. Avoid exposing them to sugary treats to help curb the habit. Ultimately, they might need to experience the negative effects themselves to understand the importance of change.

***

## How can I do a vegetarian version of the keto diet?

A vegetarian keto diet is achievable with careful planning. Key nutrients like zinc, vitamin A (retinol), B12, and DHA are challenging but can be sourced from specific foods:

1\. **Zinc and Vitamin A**: Focus on beta-carotene-rich vegetables, though retinol may require supplementation.

2\. **B12**: Consider fortified foods or supplements.

3\. **DHA and Omega-3**: Obtain from algae or spirulina.

For protein, combine sources like:

\- Spirulina

\- Nuts (e.g., walnuts)

\- Sprouted legumes

\- Organic tofu or tempeh

Keep net carbs under 50 grams per day by avoiding grains and focusing on low-carb vegetables and protein sources. With careful planning, a vegetarian keto diet can be both nutritious and effective.

## How can I do keto on a budget?

Is it expensive, doc? Not if you add intermittent fasting and you can keep the same quality of you can increase the quality because you're not eating as frequent. You're going to save money.

An average person who does one meal a day or two meals a day would save between, you know, two or three to $400 a month. So I think you can reinvest that in increasing more quality, but, um, you know, people think that junk foods or less healthy foods are cheaper. Not necessarily.

You could go, you can get healthier foods. And I just don't, I look at the grocery store and it's, I mean, even going to a fast food restaurant, it'sreally expensive. But being a college student at one time, I would live on like two burgers for a buck. And yes, there are different ways you can cheap out, but you know, you're going to have to maybe do dirty keto if you do that. But I think I would just do intermittent fasting and then keep the quality higher as you find a better job so you can afford more food.

***

## How can I fix water retention on keto?

Possible causes of water retention and their fixes:

* Low in vitamin B1 (thiamine) – vitamin B1 deficiencies will create fluid retention and edema in the ankles. Add nutritional yeast to your diet.
* Low potassium – not consuming enough vegetables can keep potassium low. But if you are consuming a lot of vegetables and still have fluid retention, it’s because you can’t digest all the fiber and that it is too much for the microorganisms that you have. Your potassium source must be from among the leafy greens and it is needed to push out the fluids.
* Fiber – a hidden source of fluid retention. It retains fluid and the body will demand fluid to bulk up the fiber, to make the stool form and go through the system.
* High salt consumption
*   High-carb diet – or too many carbs, because carbohydrates retain fluid.

## How can I increase fat intake on keto?

To ensure sufficient fat intake on keto and intermittent fasting:

1\. Incorporate healthy fats into your diet, such as:

\- Avocado

\- Olive oil

\- Coconut oil

\- Nuts and seeds

\- Fatty fish

2\. Listen to your hunger cues rather than focusing solely on reaching a specific fat percentage. Eat until satisfied, adjusting fat intake accordingly.

3\. Allow your body to utilize its own fat stores for energy by gradually reducing fat intake as weight loss progresses.

4\. During maintenance phases, increase dietary fat to maintain weight, but adjust intake as needed to align with energy requirements.

***

## How can I interpret food labels and identify hidden sugars?

Many supposedly "sugar-free" items can still contain hidden sugars, disguised under names like "real cane sugar," "brown sugar," or "coconut sugar." Even terms like "organic" or "made with real fruit" can be misleading, as the products are still heavily processed and contain added sugars. "Whole grains" and "brown rice sugar" may sound healthier, but they can still impact blood sugar levels. "Natural" doesn't necessarily mean healthy either. Always check labels carefully and be aware of hidden sugars in seemingly "healthy" foods.

***

## How can I maintain a keto diet for my family while accommodating food allergies?

Maintaining a keto diet while accommodating allergies involves focusing on acceptable foods and utilizing resources like the food list available for download on my website. There are many options to explore.

Additionally, incorporating intermittent fasting and periodic prolonged fasting can help alleviate allergies by strengthening the immune system. Avoid allergenic foods temporarily and gradually reintroduce them to build tolerance. Fasting can also benefit those with environmental allergies and autoimmune conditions, offering a comprehensive approach to managing allergies.

## How can I prevent adrenal fatigue or keto flu on the keto diet?

If you are suffering from fatigue and keto flu, you may need to consume more sea salt. Low blood pressure and lightheadedness are two more signs you may be suffering from a lack of salt. Starting a keto plan prompts significant water loss, as high-carb diets typically lead to water and sodium retention. Opt for sea salt over table salt; Himalayan pink sea salt, being unrefined, is preferable. Table salt often contains additives like dextrose, making natural salts like Himalayan pink sea salt a better choice for overall health.

Himalayan pink sea salt is beneficial because it:

• Is unrefined

• Has 84 minerals

• Is unpolluted

• Contains trace minerals

• Is antimicrobial

• Can help support healthy blood sugars

## How can I prevent muscle loss? I’m a senior.

Sarcopenia, or age-related muscle loss, can worsen due to immobility, nutritional deficiencies, lack of exercise, and certain diseases. To combat it, focus on routine exercise, especially resistance training, and consider supplements like vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, amino acids (especially leucine), and HMB (B-hydroxy B-methylbutyrate).

***

## How can I reduce my blood sugar levels on keto?

To improve lower blood sugar on keto, start by reducing your carbohydrate intake and incorporating fasting into your routine. Regular exercise is crucial, and ensure you get adequate sleep while also spending time in the sun to boost your overall well-being. Manage stress effectively, and increase your fiber intake by eating more vegetables. Consider adding apple cider vinegar (ACV) to your diet and ensure you’re getting enough potassium and Vitamin B1 to support your health.

***

## How can I relieve muscle cramps that I'm experiencing while on keto?

Add a potassium supplement and make sure you are getting enough potassium-rich greens. It may be a magnesium deficiency and is rarely a sodium deficiency. I recommend getting my Electrolyte Powder for this.

Watch this video where Dr. Berg explains the reasons for muscle cramps on Keto.

[See Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/qOyhxTVr5w4)

***

## How can I reverse insulin resistance?

In Dr. Eric Berg’s opinion, it takes about 3 to 8+ months to reverse insulin resistance. His guess is that a Healthy Keto® diet with intermittent fasting is responsible for 90%+ of the improvements. Healthy Keto provides the key nutrients you need to help speed up the process.

If you want to enhance your results, you can:

* Add exercise
* Lower your stress
* Get more sleep
* Get plenty of nutrients (zinc, vitamin D, chromium, potassium, magnesium)

***

## How can I tell if something is healthy on Keto?

Not all foods marketed as "keto" are truly healthy. Despite being under 50 grams of net carbs, some contain resistant starches like tapioca and maltodextrin, classified as fiber but impacting insulin differently. These starches are often derived from corn starch and can be misleading on labels.

To ensure you're making healthy choices, read ingredient labels carefully and look for hidden starches and sugars. Stay informed by following reliable sources for up-to-date information on keto-friendly foods.

## How do I boost my discipline for keto and exercise?

Discipline is self-control, not laziness. If you feel lazy, you may just need more energy. Start with the keto diet for increased energy and exercise. Boost your emotions to naturally enhance discipline—listen to music, partner with friends, or surround yourself with upbeat people. Speed up your activities, as moving and talking quickly can boost discipline.

Get a trainer or coach to push you further and provide valuable information. Keep your word to build willpower and integrity. Simplify your meals and workout routines—opt for easy meals and try working out for 10 minutes instead of skipping exercise altogether.

1\. Heat waffle iron per the directions that came with it.

2\. Mix all ingredients above. Do not overmix.

3\. Spray both sides of iron with oil before batter is poured in. Pour batter in and cook per the directions that came with your waffle iron. All are different!

4\. These are best served right away. If not, put them on a cookie sheet and don’t stack. They tend to get soft when stacked.

5\. Add butter and sugar-free syrup or peanut butter, and enjoy!

The following super-easy waffle bread is a variation on the waffle recipe, and cooked just like the waffles above, or as pancakes. The texture and taste make this great to use as a bread replacement! Try it out!

**Waffle Bread Ingredients:**

1 cup almond flour

1⁄4 tsp salt

1 tsp baking soda

3 Tbsp Fiber Yum (or Vitafiber, etc.) cooking spray for the pan or waffle iron

You can try adding different nuts, seeds, or herbs to this recipe. One with dried onion and poppy will taste like a bagel and would be great with cream cheese. Another one could be made with sunflower and pumpkin seeds, and another with shredded carrots and zucchini. Play with it!

Use the rounds (pancake-size) as “bread” for a cheeseburger – amazing. And it’s fun for the kids to get a sandwich on waffle bread!

Enjoy!

## How do we calculate net carbs?

Net carbs are the total carbohydrates (grams) minus fiber. Deduct the fiber carbs from the total to give you “net carbs.”

## How do you do and read a urine test?

Urine test strips are not made to diagnose anything. They are simply there to give you clues to potential irregularities in your body. Follow the instructions coming with the packaging of these strips.

Most urine test strips test 10 things:

* **Protein – too much could be a sign of kidney disease, dehydration, intense exercise or a kidney stone**
* **Leukocytes – high levels could suggest an infection, UTI or kidney stone**
* **Ketones – a potential sign that you’re on a low-carb diet, or you have diabetes**

## How do you jumpstart ketosis?

You can jumpstart ketosis by consuming coconut oil rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), strictly limiting your net carb intake to 20 grams per day, and practicing intermittent fasting to deplete blood sugar and glycogen stores.

***

## How do you know that you are in ketosis?

The biggest indicator is that you are no longer hungry! If you are on ketosis, you will be able to fast longer between meals without even the need for a snack. You will no longer crave carbs. This is because your body is now burning fat reserves. Additionally, you will feel uplifted and more energetic and your cognitive function will improve.

## How does Dr. Berg block carbs on a Keto diet?

I’m going to share how to block the effects of sugar and carbs, as well as other potentially problematic things.

1\. Sugar • Consume fiber • Take electrolytes, B vitamins, and trace minerals

2\. Grains • Consume shellfish • Take glutamine or consume foods high in glutamine • Consume B vitamins (nutritional yeast) • Take vitamin E • Consume foods high in vitamin C • Consume foods high in antioxidants • Take benfotiamine • Take alpha-lipoic acid • Exercise • Take berberine • Consume cinnamon • Consume apple cider vinegar • Consume healthy fats • Do intermittent and prolonged fasting

## How fast will I lose weight on keto?

On a Healthy Keto® diet, individuals can generally expect to lose approximately 2 pounds of fat per week, with the inclusion of intermittent fasting potentially accelerating this process. Initially, weight loss may be more significant, with individuals losing between 7 to 15 pounds in the first week, largely attributed to the loss of water weight associated with glycogen depletion. Various factors can influence weight loss on the ketogenic diet, including age, activity level, gender, metabolism, overall health, dietary choices, and stress levels.

***

## How long does it take to get back on track with keto after the holidays?

After the holiday season, it is beneficial to resume healthy habits as soon as possible, rather than extending indulgence from Thanksgiving to New Year’s. Many individuals may overestimate their overall health and cannot afford prolonged periods of overeating.

A practical approach is to enjoy holiday meals while using digestive aids, such as digestive enzymes containing betaine hydrochloride, to facilitate digestion and enhance comfort during meals. After the holiday festivities, returning to your ketogenic routine quickly is advisable. Incorporating fasting post-indulgence can also support your transition back to ketosis. For additional strategies on mitigating the effects of overeating, I recommend checking out my video on the topic.

***

## How long does it take to lose 50 pounds on keto?

This depends on many factors. Some of them are:

* Metabolism
* Age
* Stress
* Discipline
* How healthy you have been
* Insulin resistance if you have it
* Any nutritional deficiencies if you have them

Everyone is different, and the results may depend on various things. On an average you would lose 2 lbs per day on a ketogenic diet. And this is an ideal scenario.

Make sure to follow the Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting plan to get the best results.

***

## How long does it take to lose weight on Keto?

Most people experience noticeable weight loss of up to 10 pounds within the first two weeks of keto due to glycogen shedding and water loss. Once your body becomes keto-adapted, losing between one to two pounds per week isn’t uncommon.

***

## How long does it take to restart ketosis after I drink alcohol?

How long it takes to restart ketosis after you consume alcohol depends on several factors, including the type and amount of alcohol consumed, your metabolic flexibility, detoxification capacities, and overall diet. However, it's believed that it generally takes 48 to 72 hours to switch back to fat-burning and ketone production.

***

## How long does it take to see results on keto?

It really depends. When someone begins to do keto and intermittent fasting, they typically lose a lot of water weight in the first week, maybe even 8 pounds.

But then, in the second week, they are hardly losing weight at all: maybe 2 pounds. Well, the maximum amount of fat you can lose per week with a healthy metabolism is only 2 pounds. One half to 2 pounds is actually very good.

Your metabolism is living and dynamic, and it adapts to the foods you eat. When you’re not consistent with keto and intermittent fasting, this can slow down the weight loss and can potentially cause problems.

***

## How long does Keto breath last?

It can last from a few days up to 3 weeks. It is usually a sign of keto adaptation.

What you need to do is:

* Be strict with your carbs, bringing them below 20 grams per day
* Do intermittent fasting as this will speed things up and drop insulin
* Consume a little more fluid with electrolytes to encourage the body to release ketones out of the urine instead of in your breath
* Consume more foods with chlorophyll (in vegetables)

***

## How long does Keto flu last?

Usually 1 to 2 days. It can span up to 6 weeks or longer depending on how long you have been living on sugar and how bad your liver is.

If you support yourself during the transition period with the right nutrition (electrolytes and B vitamins) keto flu should go away pretty fast.

***

## How many almonds can I consume on keto?

Do not consume more than ¼ of a cup of nuts per meal, or more than 1 Tbsp of nut butter per meal.

Almonds:

Total carbs: 20 g

Fiber: 11 g

Net carbs: 9 g

Fat: 45 g

***

## How many grams of carbs can I eat without worrying about insulin resistance or high blood sugar?

The magic number is 50 net carbs. So don't go over 50 net carbs. That means you're minusing the fiber in some of the foods. But when we're talking about leafy green vegetables and salads, don't even count those. We want you to have more of those unless you're a bloater and you have some issues with that.

***

## How many grams of sugar can I have on keto?

0!

***

## How much alcohol will stop weight loss and ketosis?

Depending on how much alcohol you drink, it can literally block fat burning for two days or more and most alcohol has added carbohydrates.

**Ethanol: 7 cal/grams**

• It does not spike the insulin directly.

• It is not stored in the body

• It has to be removed by enzymes made by the liver.

• It is highly oxidative (it creates a lot of stress in the liver) – it also causes inflammation that could lead to cirrhosis and a fatty liver.

• The body considers it a toxin.

• It BLOCKS fat burning. \*if there’s alcohol in the body, it is going to stop burning the fat and it switches focus to the danger situation through the use of enzymes.

***

## How much fat per day is best on keto?

On average, consume 20 to 40 grams of fat per meal. Multiply by how many meals you eat to get the total.

However, the best way to determine how much fat you need to consume is to base it on how you feel. If you feel satisfied with the meal and it allows you to not be hungry until the next meal, then that might be the best amount for you.

## How much is too much fat on Keto?

This is a balance of enough versus too much and getting your sweet spot (no pun intended).

If you have hypoglycemia (low blood sugars) you will need a bit more to go from one meal to the next. However, you also need to make sure you do not have too much, thus overloading the gallbladder and causing (bloating, right shoulder pain, etc). Also, if you consume too much fat, esp. between meals or after meals, you will end up burning dietary fat and NOT your own fat despite being in ketosis.

This is why I recommend always doing intermittent fasting with ketosis. So in other words - you'll have to adjust your fats until it's just right - no gallbladder issues, but allowing you to go from one meal to the next. If you are new to this, you may want to get my booklet or even my bigger book either on the website - drberg.com or amazon. On my website - you can get both as a discount, but not on amazon.

## How much protein is good on Keto and IF?

You will have to calculate between .36 grams - .7 grams of protein multiplied by your body weight to get how much protein you need to eat a day. To figure out how much you need a per meal you will take the end number and divide it by how many meals you eat a day.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/how-much-protein-on-keto-intermittent-fasting-plan-is-good-drberg)

***

## How much protein is too much on a ketogenic diet?

To manage insulin, aim for 3-6 oz of protein per meal, adjusting for fitness and metabolism. For regular workouts, up to 8 oz may be okay. For one meal a day, you might need more protein.

Dr. Berg suggests grass-fed beef, pasture-raised chicken (with skin), eggs, and wild-caught salmon. Fattier proteins help lower insulin levels.

Calculate your protein needs: body weight (lbs) x 0.4. Divide by your meals per day (2 or 3).

Example: At 172 lbs, you need 68.8g/day. For 2 meals, that's 34.4g/meal.

Adjust to find your ideal amount.

## How much salt should I consume on a Keto diet?

Always use sea salt. If you are on a high-carb diet, you will retain sodium. When you are on a low-carb diet, you will need more salt.

**LOW SODIUM SYMPTOM:**

-weakness

-muscle cramps

-constipation

-palpitation

-headaches

-fatigue

## How much water do I drink on Keto?

Some people drink about 2 to 3 cups of water a day. Your body adjusts to maintain a natural balance. Just make sure only to drink when you’re thirsty.

But when fasting, you’re losing glycogen. With the glycogen loss (stored sugar), you’re also going to lose a lot of fluid. This fluid isn’t just water. It’s a combination of water, electrolytes and salts – which need to go back into the body.

It would be a good idea for someone to consume between 2 and 3 liters of water per day while fasting. This quantity could also help prevent kidney stones. You would want to be sure to add electrolytes and sea salt. Forgetting electrolytes and sea salt can potentially lead to keto fatigue, keto flu and overall weakness.

Make sure to consume water when you are thirsty only, to avoid overhydration with its problems.

***

## How much water should I drink on keto?

It’s best to drink water only when you are thirsty. Water myths:

* 60% of the body is water – false
* The body doesn’t know when it’s thirsty – false
* Water flushes out fat – false
* Water flushes out toxins – false
* Water helps dry skin – false

The people who drink the most water are actually the most dehydrated because of the difference it makes in their electrolytes, since too much water can flush out the electrolytes you need in your body.

Hyponatremia is a condition where you can get really sick or even die because of drinking too much water.

Dr. Berg says he drinks about 2 to 3 cups of water a day.

Your body adjusts to maintain a natural balance. Just make sure to drink only when you’re thirsty.

***

## How often should you take a break from keto?

Healthy Keto® with intermittent fasting will work while you do it, but the benefits will stop if you stop. You might see some awesome keto diet results, or intermittent fasting results, and think it’s okay to stop. But the long-term effects of keto are so beneficial, you really don’t want to stop or take a break.

The purpose of doing the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting is so much more than just weight loss. Doing keto long-term is a way of eating to minimize health problems. You will eventually build up your health reserve and you will be able to go off of the program here and there. But, there are no phases of the ketogenic diet. After you reach your keto weight-loss goal, instead of adding in carbs, you can add in more calories and more fat.

***

## How should I cook Keto food?

Yes.

Here are some ways to avoid complex recipes and cooking on keto:

* Buy boiled eggs – add butter, mayonnaise, sour cream, salt and pepper
* Simple salad – lettuce (salad) with olive oil and vinegar
* Sauté spinach with canned tuna or sardines, and you can shake some Parmesan cheese on it as well
* Eat sardines – simple, healthy and convenient
* Consume nuts or nut butters during your meals
* Eat celery with hummus or nut butters
* Consume fattier cheeses
* Get high-quality summer sausages or ham at the health food store, and sometimes combine them with cheeses
* Consume protein shakes (but not whey or soy protein)
* Mushrooms with cheese could also be a good meal addition
* Prepare keto bombs over the weekend and keep them in the freezer as keto-friendly desserts

***

## How to choose protein correctly on Keto?

In nature, protein never comes as a complete protein—it comes with fat. There is something called the insulin index, which looks at the protein effect on insulin. The leaner the protein, the higher the spike in insulin. You would want to consume fattier proteins and avoid lean proteins to get into deeper ketosis.

The calories in your keto diet should consist of about 10% carbs (5% of your carbs should be from vegetables), 20% protein, and 70% fat. This is about 3.5 times more fat than protein. But, really, we have to look at the weight because there is more condensed energy in fat than protein. Now, we’re looking at 1.56g of fat and 1g of protein. Having a higher fat to protein ratio can have many benefits.

**A closer look at fat to protein ratios:**

Egg: (add fat) Fat — 1 Protein — 1

Hamburger: Fat — 2 Protein — 1

Steak: (add fat) Fat — 1 Protein — 2

Chicken: (eat the skin on the chicken) Fat — 1 Protein — 2

Bacon: (add fat) Fat — 1 Protein — 1

Pecans: (a tiny bit of carbs) Fat — 7 Protein — 1

Peanuts: (a tiny bit of carbs) Fat — 2 Protein — 1

Cod liver: Fat — 5 Protein — 1

Summer sausage: Fat — 2 Protein — 1

Macadamia nuts: Fat — 11.5 Protein — 1

Sardines: Fat — 1 Protein — 2

Salmon: Fat — 1.5 Protein — 1

## How to make a tasty and healthy salad dressing?

It’s difficult to find healthy salad dressings at the store that don’t contain sugar or oils high in omega-6 fatty acids. The salad dressings I’m going to share have unique health benefits. Of course, salad has a lot of important benefits, but choosing the right salad dressing can take it to the next level.

Here’s how to make salad dressing at home. You will use a simple base of extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and apple cider vinegar for each of these salad dressings.

Add this base to a 16-ounce jar and keep it in your refrigerator. Each time you have a salad, add a quarter cup to half a cup of this base to a bowl, add your spices, mix it up, and pour it on your salad.

**Ingredients for the salad dressing base:**

1/3 cup (2.5 ounces) extra virgin olive oil

1/4 cup (2 ounces) apple cider vinegar

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) lemon juice

**Apple cider vinaigrette dressing:**

1 tablespoon mustard

1 clove garlic (minced)

1 pinch sea salt

## How to start eating healthy?

If you can't stick to a healthy eating plan or a diet, then you need to do these 4 things:

1\. Decide that enough is enough

2\. Realize your body is stupid and won't give you correct answers.

3\. Reduce the physical body cravings

4\. Plan your meals - don't just go from one meal to the next.

***

## I am struggling to commit to keto and intermittent fasting 100%. What do you suggest?

Starting gradually is key when transitioning to a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, especially if you're accustomed to frequent meals and a high-carb diet. Incorporating MCT oil can help reduce cravings and support longer fasting periods, but introduce it gradually to avoid digestive issues. As your body adapts to fat burning, the process becomes easier, leading to uplifted mood, reduced cravings, and increased energy. Ensure you consume enough nutrients by incorporating plenty of vegetables and nutritional yeast into your diet. Keep progressing towards your goal with consistency and patience.

***

## I can’t get my ketone levels high enough – what should I do?

Here are five things you need to know when increasing your ketone levels.

* It takes time – If you just started on keto, you will need to give it some time before you fully switch over to ketosis. Your mitochondria do not fully adapt to ketosis right away. It can take around one month to become fully keto-adapted.
* Use the right test – Testing your ketones can be a great way to figure out where you are in your keto-adaptation. First, you can use urine ketone tests. However, as your body adapts to ketosis, it will naturally become more efficient at burning ketones, leaving you with little to no ketones in your urine. At this point, you want to use a blood ketone test.
* Keep your protein intake in check – Having more than 8 oz of protein per meal may spike your insulin levels high enough to slow down ketosis. Make sure you increase your fat-to- protein ratio and have around 3 to 6 oz of protein per meal. Sausage, olives, olive oil, fatty fish, fatty cheese, pecans, macadamia nuts, butter, cod liver oil, stew and sardines are great foods for increasing your fat-to-protein ratio.
* Stress – High stress levels can have effects similar to sugar. Stress can trigger cortisol and lower your ketones.
* Lack of sleep – Not getting enough high-quality sleep can throw off your blood sugar levels and limit your ability to get into ketosis.

***

## I can’t quit carbs. What should I do?

Carbohydrates are highly addictive. We are conditioned as children to feed a carb addiction – most children consume large amounts of sugar daily. Sugars and refined grains are added to baby food, cereal, candy and virtually all processed foods.

Carbs are so addictive because they trigger two hormones: dopamine and serotonin. These are pleasure and happiness hormones.

Over time, an addiction to carbs becomes stronger and stronger. So what can you do to break a carb addiction? Take a look.

* Stop eating immediately – The first thing you should do is start fasting. This will kick-start ketosis, which is when your body burns fat as fuel instead of glucose (sugar). This will begin to heal your neurotransmitter receptors that are triggering intense carb cravings.
* Exercise – This will further increase your fat-burning and allow you to get rid of any excess glucose in your system.
* Avoid triggers – Get rid of all carbohydrates and sugars in the house, avoid images of food (like commercials or unhealthy recipe books), don’t go to restaurants with unhealthy foods, avoid food smells that cause cravings, etc.
* Take B vitamins – All B vitamins are important for lessening the addiction to carbs– especially vitamin B1. Using nutritional yeast is a great way to get your B vitamins.

***

## I experience headaches on keto. What do I do?

This is usually a problem with low blood sugar. Your brain has not fully adapted to ketosis quite yet. Add one more meal for a while until your body adapts more efficiently and can go longer without the drop in blood sugars. We also recommend taking Dr. Berg's course on How to Burn Fat & Get into Healthy Ketosis WITHOUT Any Side Effects! Here is the link to the course: [https://www.drberg.com/how-to-do-ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/how-to-do-ketosis)

## I feel drained and exhausted on keto. What can I do?

Take more vitamins B1 and B5. Nutritional yeast will provide these and other B vitamins as well. We recommend trying Dr. Berg's Nutritional Yeast Tablets.

Here is what Dr. Berg has to say about exhaustion on Keto:

[See Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/uVEnZ9jvlpc)

***

## I had a cheat day. Now how do I recover?

Take these nutrients individually to recover faster from a cheat meal:

* Magnesium
* Potassium
* Vitamin B1
* Vitamin D

They will help stabilize your blood sugar, improve insulin resistance, and buffer the effects of high sugar to a certain degree.

Incorporate exercise to burn up the excess sugar that you have consumed.

Get right on a fasting program. Fast longer to make up the damage from the cheat meal. This will bring your insulin back down to where you need it to be, and your body will burn up the excess sugar and tap into fat again.

When you go off the keto plan do not spread this out over a long period of time. Do it for a short period of time and get right back on. The longer you are off, the harder it will be to get back.

## I have bad breath on keto. What do I do?

If your breath has the odor of ammonia, cut back on protein and add more salads to your diet. You can also add a little apple cider vinegar to aid digestion.

## I have been on Healthy Keto and OMAD for 5 years. Do cravings for fatty cheese and sour cream indicate a nutritional deficiency?

I think I would eat those things. Especially if you're craving fat. Consume the fatty cheese. Just make sure it's good quality. If you can find some good European cheese, that's raw. That would be the best for you.

***

## I have really bad acne. Will keto help me with this?

The Healthy Keto® diet can effectively address acne, eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, and other skin issues by regulating hormonal imbalances. These conditions often stem from high androgen levels, which can lead to increased oil production in the skin and consequently, acne. Insulin plays a significant role in triggering androgens, and its reduction through the combination of keto and intermittent fasting (IF) can help lower androgen levels. IF complements keto by further reducing insulin, offering a powerful approach to managing skin problems by addressing hormonal imbalances.

***

## I just started keto. Can I have a cheat meal?

It is certainly not recommended.

When you first start keto and you’re not fully adapted to fat burning, just one cheat meal can mean it takes you a lot longer (24+ hours) to get back on track.

Look for alternative types of pleasure foods that mimic the brownies, cakes, cookies, bread, pizza etc. that you crave. Go for keto-friendly, low-carb, no-sugar treats to satisfy that craving.

Once you start cheating it is hard to stop because sugar is addictive. Having cheat meals will put your blood sugar levels on a roller coaster. Having unstable blood sugars will not help you correct insulin problems that are a barrier to weight loss.

Once you are fully keto-adapted and have enough health reserve, if you decide to have a cheat meal you can bounce back a lot quicker to make up for the damage. Your goal is to create health with consistency. Start where you are and build yourself up to being 100%.

***

## I want to go on a ketogenic diet, but I don’t want to cause kidney stones. What can I do to prevent them?

To prevent kidney stones or gout on the ketogenic plan, consider these tips:

1\. Increase citrates by adding 1 lemon to your water daily. Despite being acidic, lemon turns alkaline in the body, which helps prevent stone formation.

2\. Consume ample vegetables to ensure sufficient nutrient intake.

3\. Stay hydrated by increasing fluid intake, and consider adding 1 tsp of sea salt per day or electrolyte powder to maintain hydration.

4\. Avoid cruciferous vegetables and spinach to reduce oxalate intake. If you do consume foods high in oxalates, pair them with calcium-rich foods in the same meal to bind oxalates and prevent stone formation. Avoid consuming oxalates and calcium separately to prevent stone formation.]

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

***

## If I lose weight on keto, will I end up with loose, sagging belly skin?

Following a Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting can prevent loose skin after weight loss if done correctly. Your skin, the largest organ in the body, heals as you get healthier, improving collagen structure. Loose skin, or atrophy, often results from a protein deficiency worsened by insulin resistance, a common issue in weight gain.

The ketogenic diet addresses insulin resistance, enabling amino acids to enter cells and form proteins, which helps tighten the skin. During this process, you might experience a weight plateau as muscle, which is heavier than fat, rebuilds. However, you’ll notice your size shrinking and your waist getting smaller.

Combining keto with intermittent fasting spikes growth hormone levels up to 2000%, further preserving protein and supporting skin recovery.

## I’m insulin-resistant and apple cider vinegar gives me dandruff and skin redness, any tips?

If you're experiencing issues with apple cider vinegar, it's best to discontinue its use for now. Switching to organic varieties may alleviate the problem. In the meantime, consider alternative supplements to address insulin resistance, such as Berberine or cinnamon. Additionally, maintain a healthy ketogenic diet with organic ingredients to support your overall health and manage insulin levels effectively.

***

## I'm not hungry on keto but still feeling weak - why is that?

One of the best indicators to know if you’re in ketosis is the hunger goes away. But at the same time, you should not have low energy or fatigue on keto. If you’re feeling weak while on keto, it’s likely related to nutrient deficiencies.

How to fix low energy or feeling weak on the ketogenic diet:

**Muscle weakness** - Deficiency of vitamin E or sodium

Consume: Seeds, nuts, leafy greens, or a vitamin E complex supplement for a vitamin E deficiency. For low sodium, consume at least 1 tsp. of sea salt per day.

**Brain Fog** - Insulin resistance

Consume: MCT oil, and vitamin D

**Fatigue** - A vitamin B1, vitamin B5, or potassium deficiency

Consume: Nutritional yeast, potassium, and magnesium (electrolytes, and vegetables).

## I'm not losing weight on Keto, what am I doing wrong?

\### Key Tips for Succeeding on the Keto Diet

1\. **Focus on Fat, Not Carbs**: Your body burns fat only when glucose is absent. Avoid hidden carbs like maltodextrin and tapioca starch. Aim for less than 10 grams of carbs per day.

2\. **Mind Your Eating Habits**: Eating too frequently, consuming sugar alcohols, certain nuts, cheese, or specific vegetables can cause bloating and constipation. Snacking spikes insulin, leading to belly fat. Consider intermittent fasting to reduce insulin spikes.

3\. **Adjust for Age and Metabolism**: People over 40 may benefit from eating one meal a day (OMAD) due to a slower metabolism.

4\. **Understand Menopause and Metabolism**: During menopause, cortisol spikes can cause muscle atrophy, which may appear as fat. Keto helps rebuild muscle and heal insulin resistance over time.

5\. **Moderate Protein Intake**: Too much protein can raise insulin levels. Aim for 3-6 ounces per meal, up to 8 ounces if very active.

6\. **Prioritize Health Over Weight Loss**: Focus on overall health improvements, like increased energy, better cognitive function, and improved sleep, to support weight loss and well-being.

By following these guidelines, you'll not only enhance your chances of weight loss but also enjoy various health benefits on the keto diet.

## Is a balsamic glaze keto-friendly?

Unfortunately no balsamic glaze is not keto-friendly.

## Is a ketogenic diet expensive?

It doesn’t have to be. In fact, the more you are going to be on keto, the less money you will spend on junk foods as your cravings will go away.

***

## Is a Ketogenic Diet too extreme?

That belief comes from two different concepts. One is the sentiment, “Everything in moderation”. The other is, “There’s no good or bad food, just molecules. You just have to balance your foods”.

Let’s take a look at keto. You’ll eat moderate protein, higher fats, and low-carb foods. You need to lower your carbs to 20-50 grams per day. This is what people consider extreme.

But let’s compare keto to the standard American diet! It’s about 350 grams of carbs per day, which has become our new normal. But this is what’s extreme! Our society consumes pounds of sugar each year. Keto only sounds extreme if you don’t understand dietary sugar and blood sugar. When you get your blood glucose tested, you want it to be about 80 mg/dL. That equates to about one teaspoon of sugar in all of your blood. The average person consumes 28-30 teaspoons. That’s extreme!

What I consider extreme is the 4 billion prescriptions handed out each year in the US. The $3.4 trillion we spend on health care each year. And 60 percent of the US population is either pre-diabetic or diabetic. Keto is normal and reasonable and helps people get healthy.

## Is any sugar alcohol safe to consume on Keto?

Some sugar alcohols are keto-friendly. Here is the chart for different sugar alcohols showing their effects on blood sugars.

Xylitol is a favorite for some people on keto because they say it doesn’t have an aftertaste. Xylitol and everything below it is going to be fine while on keto.

* Maltodextrin - 110
* Glucose - 100
* Sucrose - 65
* High-fructose corn syrup - 58
* Honey - 50
* Maltitol - 35
* Xylitol - 12
* Sorbitol - 9
* Mannitol - 2
* Erythritol - 1
* Monk fruit - 0
* Stevia - 0

Although high-fructose corn syrup has a lower glycemic number compared to maltodextrin, it can be even worse because it messes with your liver and causes insulin resistance. Avoid it at all costs!

## Is baba ganoush keto?

If it is made right. Make a batch at home and enjoy. Eggplants are about 3 carbs per cup. You’re allowed 20 to 50 grams of carbs per day on the Healthy Keto® eating plan.

***

## Is cassava safe to consume on Keto?

Can you have cassava chips on keto? Cassava is very high in carbohydrates. It’s also very high on the glycemic index. Cassava is a starch—it’s a root vegetable. Cassava is also used to make tapioca. Tapioca is not keto-friendly. Another name for cassava is yuca. Cassava or yuca is not keto-friendly.

Cassava also contains very small amounts of vitamin B1 (thiamine). This is a problem because anytime you have something with a lot of carbs and low vitamin B1, you can create a vitamin B1 deficiency. This happens because it takes vitamin B1 to metabolize carbs.

## Is chronic stress slowing ketosis?

High levels of stress increase the hormone called cortisol which is a type of hormone that makes the liver increase sugars even without consuming sugar. The high levels of sugar then lead to high levels of insulin and with high insulin you cannot get into ketosis which can make you gain more weight. He also talks about the different causes of stress.

Cause of Stress:

• Problems

• Relationships

• Sick Parent/Child

• Losses

• Chronic Pain

• Constant Worry

Remedies:

• Take vitamin B1- Nutritional yeast is a good source.

• Long walks

• More Sleep

## Is coconut milk or water keto-friendly?

**Canned coconut milk (1 cup):**

Fat—58g

Carb—13g

Fiber—5g

Net carb—8g

Potassium—631g

**Silk coconut milk (1 cup):**

Fat—4g

Carb—1g

Potassium—310g

Depending on what type of coconut milk you get, it’s going to be more or less keto-friendly, but even 8g of carbs aren’t too bad. You just want to make sure you have less than 20g-30g of carbs per day to really get into ketosis.

**Overall, is coconut milk keto-friendly? Yes.** And, it works great in coffee and in all kinds of keto-friendly recipes.

**Coconut water (1 cup):**

Fat—0.5g

Carb—11g

Potassium—600mg

Sodium—282mg

A lot of people consume coconut water for electrolytes because the potassium/sodium ratio is pretty good. I do think the carbs are a bit too high for keto. But, depending on how many other carbs you have in a day, you may still be able to get away with it. It’s definitely much better than juice or soda.

## Is hard alcohol low-carb?

Hard liquor and spirits are considered low-carb drinks. However, while hard alcohol may not contain carbs, it’s often consumed with high-carb mixers, including soft drinks, fruit juices, or syrups.

***

## Is it appropriate for children to follow a ketogenic diet?

While a strict ketogenic diet may not be appropriate for children, adopting a low-carbohydrate approach can be beneficial. Children may tolerate a higher intake of certain carbohydrates, such as fruits and occasional sweet potatoes, while avoiding typical sugary foods. It is advisable to eliminate processed cereals and grains from their diet.

I recommend focusing on three substantial meals each day rather than frequent snacking, as constant snacking can lead to repeated spikes in insulin levels. Children have a naturally high metabolism, and if they are physically active, they can effectively utilize some of the carbohydrates from fruits and other sources. As always, consulting with a healthcare professional or nutritionist is recommended to ensure that any dietary changes are appropriate for a child’s specific needs.

***

## Is it normal to have red stool after eating beets?

Yes, it's normal to have red stool after eating beets. Beets contain betanin, a red pigment giving beets their distinct color. Some people cannot fully break down betanin during digestion, resulting in reddish-colored stool and urine.

Red stool after eating beets isn't anything to worry about. However, if your stool is red more than a day or two after eating beets, it's best to consult with your doctor. Red stool can indicate intestinal bleeding.

***

## Is it ok for kids to drink fruit juice?

Even a pediatric group says, “Fruit juice has no essential role in healthy balanced diets of children”. That’s an understatement. Fruit juice has the same amount of sugar as soda. It's a pasteurized product; that is, it’s nutritionally dead. When you consume that much concentrated sugar without fiber or phytonutrients, you'll create vitamin deficiencies.

**Children between the ages of 2 and 18 consume 50 percent of their fruit as juice. So when a group of doctors who specialize in caring for children make a statement about fruit juice not playing an essential role in a healthy diet for children, it highlights how little they actually know about the role of sugar causing kids’ insulin to get too high and damage their health down the road.**

The worst thing you can do is give your baby fruit juice. They’re still developing. Giving them pure sugar is going to set them up for diabetes. In fact, you don’t want to give liquid fruit to any children.

***

## Is it okay to do carb cycling on keto and intermittent fasting?

Avoid carb cycling on keto and intermittent fasting. Consuming refined carbs disrupts ketosis, switching your body to sugar burning.

People often crave carbs because of low blood sugar and energy. However, incorporating carbs blocks keto, which relies on very low carb intake.

With proper adaptation, you'll transition to fat burning efficiently, maintaining high endurance and stable performance. Aim to build a strong health reserve so occasional deviations from keto have minimal impact.

## Is it possible to alleviate migraines by following a ketogenic diet?

There are many things that can cause a migraine headache. But ketones can potentially help your brain in many ways.

A study in 1930 demonstrated that 28% of migraine sufferers reported having no migraines after being on keto. 25% of migraine sufferers reported less frequent migraines after being on keto.

Recent evidence suggests that migraines may stem from a cerebral energy deficiency. Part of the brain may not be getting energy. This could also relate to insulin resistance, which could be one reason why ketones may be effective. Ketones actually provide an alternative fuel to the brain.

The other factor that may contribute to a migraine is too much oxidative stress compared to how much antioxidant capacity you have. Ketones can act as an antioxidant.

Ketones may not only protect you from free-radical damage, but also they may act as an anti- inflammatory. Your brain loves ketones and actually prefers ketones over glucose.

**Potential benefits of ketones for the brain:**

* Can help improve your mood
* Can help improve your cognitive function (memory, focus and concentration)
* May help improve epilepsy
* Could help increase mitochondria function
* Can help reduce oxidative stress

If you have migraines, you may want to get on the ketogenic diet. It may also be beneficial to consume MCT oil and even exogenous ketones to help boost your ketones further.

**How to help supply the brain with ketones:**

* Do Healthy Keto®
* Eliminate snacks (do intermittent fasting)

***

## Is it possible to do healthy raw vegan keto?

Achieving ketosis while adhering to a vegan diet is indeed feasible, albeit more challenging. The primary difficulty lies in balancing macronutrients, particularly in obtaining sufficient fat and complete protein sources. Adequate intake of nutrients like zinc, typically found in animal products, may require careful attention and supplementation from alternative plant-based sources. Similarly, obtaining the active form of vitamin A, such as retinol, and essential omega-3 fatty acids can pose challenges and necessitate strategic dietary planning.

***

## Is it possible to follow a ketogenic diet without a gallbladder?

Yes.

With the keto diet, 75% of your calories are coming from fat. The purpose of the gallbladder is to store and concentrate bile, which is the detergent that breaks down fats. Foods, especially fats, trigger the release of bile. Bile helps absorb fat-soluble vitamins, essential fatty acids, etc.

Without a gallbladder, you could have incomplete fat digestion or a deficiency in important fat-soluble vitamins.

You could try taking Dr. Berg’s Gallbladder Formula (see drberg.com) if you don’t have a gallbladder, to get more purified bile salts. This could potentially help you have enough bile to support complete digestion. You may also want to do intermittent fasting along with the keto diet.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

***

## Is it possible to lose weight on a ketogenic diet without exercising?

Yes. The diet contributes 85% of the progress with weight loss and exercise contributes only 15%. But then, there are benefits of exercise for your weight goal.

Benefits of exercise:

* Increases oxygen
* Lowers stress
* Increases fitness
* Tones
* Atrophy (Women going through menopause may experience atrophy in thighs and butt. Exercise helps overcome this atrophy.)
* Increases and prevents the loss of muscle mass
* Stabilizes blood sugars
* Improves sleep
* Improves stiff joints
* Increases / improves blood flow
* Strengthens heart

If you have an adrenal problem, the key is to keep the duration of exercise very short, the intensity very high, and the recovery very long. It is also important not to overtrain.

***

## Is keto bad for you?

Keto isn't inherently bad; it simply means fat burning. However, the quality of your food choices matters. Healthy Keto® emphasizes high-quality, nutrient-rich foods, while regular keto may overlook this aspect. Ketoacidosis, a dangerous condition, is rare and typically only occurs in specific circumstances like uncontrolled type 1 diabetes. In Healthy Keto, fat burning occurs without risking ketoacidosis, making it a safe and beneficial approach.

## Is keto good for hypothyroidism?

Yes. When you are on the ketogenic diet, you are actually improving the efficiency of the thyroid.

***

## Is keto not for me if I feel better on carbs?

To answer that question, first let’s cover why you feel better on carbs.

Usually in this situation you are dealing with low blood sugars (hypoglycemia). With this condition you will find that you can’t go from one meal to the next without feeling irritable or you can’t handle going a certain amount of time without eating some carbs.

When you consume sugar or refined carbs this will raise your blood sugar and you will feel better. However, shortly after you will feel cravings and hunger again. This is because your body will produce insulin to lower the blood sugars.

So if you feel better on carbs it simply means you have insulin and blood sugar problems and a ketogenic diet is definitely for you. Once you get through the transition period (to fat burning), you will feel uplifted, with more energy and better cognitive function.

***

## Is keto sustainable?

Yes. Once you get through the transition period, it is very easy to follow. You will cease to have carb cravings, and overall will feel uplifted and energetic.

## Is Ketogenic diet safe for thyroid?

**What is the thyroid?** The thyroid is in the base of the neck, and it’s controlled by the pituitary. The thyroid makes T4, but T4 is inactive. T4 has to be converted to the active form, which is T3. 80% of the conversion happens through the liver, and 20 % happens through the kidney.

**How does keto affect thyroid function?** When you go on a ketogenic diet, T4 will decrease up to 40%.

But let’s look at the big picture. There are no studies out there that show any negative effects on the thyroid when you go on a keto or low-carb diet. Also, despite the 40% drop, there is no drop in metabolism. T3 is becoming more sensitive and more effective. I believe that high carb diets increase the need for more thyroid hormone, so T3 is higher. With a keto diet, T3 goes down, but I think that’s not actually abnormal. I believe that number is normal for what our bodies are designed to use.

**So, is keto safe for thyroid function?** Yes. When you’re on the ketogenic diet, you’re actually improving the efficiency of the thyroid.

## Is Maltitol safe to consume on Keto?

Malitol has a glycemic index of between 57 and 70. This is definitely not keto-friendly. Maltitol could be one of the worst sugar alcohols because half of it is glucose, which is 100 on the glycemic index.

## Is MCT Oil good or bad for the liver?

Omega-3 fatty acids are very good for a fatty liver. This includes fish oil and cod liver oil. MCT oils, which are medium-chain triglycerides, are a unique type of fat that can be very good for your liver.

**MCT fats are “burned” or oxidized into energy very quickly. Unlike other oils, MCT oil is water-soluble. Why is this significant? It doesn’t depend on bile or enzymes—you don’t have to break down MCT oil at all.**

MCT oil bypasses your digestive system and is absorbed directly into the body.

**MCT oil is great for:**

• Malabsorption

• Epilepsy

• Supporting a healthy heart

• Those with no gallbladder

Keep in mind that MCT oil doesn’t contain vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids—so you’ll still need to get these in your diet when using MCTs.

***

## Is mustard oil a Healthy Keto option?

Yes, Dr. Berg approves of mustard oil on the Healthy Keto plan. Here are some key points:

* **Health Benefits**: Dr. Berg mentions that mustard oil is good for cramps at night, including nocturnal cramps in the calves, feet, and legs.
* **Cruciferous Family**: Mustard is part of the cruciferous family, which has various health benefits.
* **Keto Diet**: Dr. Berg confirms that mustard oil can be used on the keto diet and is a good alternative to olive oil, especially in Southeast Asia.

## Is SlimFast safe to consume on Keto?

The first problem with these products is the ingredient list. The ingredients include:

* Maltodextrin (110 on the glycemic index–sugar is only 70!)
* Dextrose (Synthetic sugar with the glycemic index of 100)
* Tapioca
* Soy (GMO)
* Canola oil (GMO)
* Synthetic vitamins (poorly absorbed)
* Caffeine
* Beet sugar (GMO)

These are poor-quality ingredients, which should have no place in a ketogenic diet.

A second problem with these products is that they are snack-based–meaning they are meant to be eaten as snacks or treats, like chips, bars and energy boosters. This isn’t compatible with intermittent fasting. Consistent blood sugar spikes will halt weight loss.

A final problem with SlimFast is their integrity. They are still producing the original SlimFast, which has 18 grams of sugar (beet sugar). We have a massive epidemic right now of people consuming too much sugar. Promoting more sugar consumption is not okay for a company that is supposed to be helping people improve their health.

Overall, it seems that SlimFast is just trying to tap into a trending market to make a big profit.

## Is tapioca starch ok to consume on Keto?

No. Tapioca is a starch that comes from the cassava plant. It’s actually quite high in carbohydrates. In fact, the carbohydrate content of cassava flour is 25% more than that of white flour.

If we compare tapioca flour to almond flour, this is what we find:

* 1/4 cup tapioca flour – 27 net carbs
* 1/4 cup almond flour – 3 net carbs

There is an ingredient found in many so-called “keto-friendly” products called soluble tapioca fiber. Soluble tapioca fiber is the same thing as “prebiotic tapioca” and “organic non-GMO tapioca fiber.”

Soluble tapioca fiber is a big source of IMO, which is a common sweetener. Dr. Berg no longer recommends it. Recent studies show that IMO has the same glycemic effect as glucose and dextrose. It’s actually worse to use than sugar. If you want to eat keto-friendly foods and stay in ketosis, you may want to stay away from tapioca flour and tapioca fiber.

***

## Is the ketogenic diet a suitable option for weight gain?

While the ketogenic diet is often associated with weight loss, it can also offer benefits for overall health beyond just managing weight. Low-carb diets and intermittent fasting can significantly support liver health and metabolic function. However, if your goal is to gain weight on a keto diet, it requires careful planning.

To maintain or gain weight, you'll need to increase your caloric intake while ensuring your dietary fat is at an appropriate level. Consuming sufficient dietary fat is essential for producing ketones; otherwise, your body may resort to burning its own fat for energy, which can lead to weight loss rather than gain.

To achieve this, consider adding healthy fats at the end of your meals, such as macadamia nuts, pecans, or desserts made with raw cream or MCT oil. Additionally, focus on strength training exercises with lower repetitions and higher volume. This approach can help you build muscle mass and strength while following a ketogenic diet, allowing you to effectively increase your weight in a healthy manner.

***

## Is the ketogenic diet appropriate for individuals with mitochondrial disease?

The ketogenic diet is particularly beneficial for mitochondrial health. Mitochondria, the energy factories of our cells, thrive on ketones, which enhance their efficiency. The mitochondria convert food into energy through complex processes involving electrons and other fascinating mechanisms. Adopting a ketogenic diet is one of the best things you can do for your mitochondria.

\***We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

***

## Is there a common Keto ingredient that stops Keto?

Keto is a low-carb diet. Most people know that, on keto, they need to cut out sugar and grains. But, it’s also important to cut out grain oils, or more specifically, seed oils. Many people call grain oils vegetable oils, but they’re really not vegetable oils. They don’t get the oil from vegetables—they get it from the seed of the plant. The problem with grain oil is omega-6 fats. Omega-6 fats are highly inflammatory. They can actually trigger insulin resistance just as much as sugar or refined grains. Grain oils can also get stuck in the body and clog up the liver and brain. Not to mention that many grain oils are GMO.

**Oils and foods higher in omega-6 fats:**

• Soy

• Cottonseed

• Canola

• Corn

• Safflower

• Sunflower

• Almond flour

• Peanut butter

I’m not saying you can’t have some things higher in omega-6 fats like almond flour and peanut butter, but you might want to balance it out by getting omega-3 fats. An average person in America has 15 times more omega-6 than omega-3.

**Top sources (some are keto, some are not)**

1\. Chicken

2\. Grain desserts

3\. Salad dressing

4\. Chips

5\. Nuts/seeds

6\. Pizza

7\. Bread

8\. Fries

9\. Pasta

**The definition of keto is low-carb, and it doesn’t really emphasize the type of fat you should be consuming. I believe healthy keto is the best way to go.**

**Healthier oils:**

• Coconut oil

• Butter

• Olive oil

• Avocado oil

If you’re plateauing on keto, you may be consuming too many grain oils, or you could be using too much almond flour or peanut butter.

**Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids:**

• Fish

• Cod liver oil

• Grass-fed beef and other animal products

• Walnuts

• Chia seed

• Brussels sprouts

**Do not use:**

**• Soy oil**

**• Cottonseed oil**

**• Canola oil**

**• Corn oil**

**Limit:**

• Safflower oil

• Sunflower oil

**Reduce these if you have a problem with inflammation or you’ve hit a plateau:**

• Almond flour

• Peanut butter

## Is there any maltodextrin in Keto foods?

### **The Hidden Truth About Maltodextrin in Keto Foods**

Maltodextrin sneaks into keto-friendly foods, masquerading as an innocent additive. But don't be fooled. With a glycemic index soaring at 110, it's anything but friendly to your ketosis goals, outranking even table sugar on the blood sugar spike meter.

Most troubling is its origin story—often derived from corn or wheat that's been genetically modified (GMO). This means not only are you grappling with potential blood sugar issues, but you're also possibly consuming GMOs and glyphosate residues without realizing it.

If staying in [ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-know-you-are-in-ketosis) matters to you, reading labels becomes more than a habit; it's your shield against hidden disruptors like maltodextrin. Opt for whole-food ingredients and sidestep this unwelcome guest hiding in your so-called "keto" treats.

### **Dextrose: The Hidden Sugar Impacting Ketosis**

Imagine you're on a keto diet, carefully picking your foods to stay in ketosis. But here's the kicker: some "keto-friendly" products might pull the wool over your eyes with dextrose.

This sweet devil has a glycemic index of 100, which is like inviting sugar to crash your low-carb party uninvited.

[Dextrose](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-a-product-with-dextrose-still-be-keto) sneaks into various foods under the guise of being harmless or even beneficial. Yet, its high glycemic index means it can spike [blood sugar levels](https://www.drberg.com/blog/blood-sugar-levels-high-despite-keto-and-fasting) fast and hard, throwing you out of ketosis quicker than you can say "carbs." Here’s why that matters for keto followers.

This synthetic sugar is often found where you least expect it - from processed meats to salad dressings. The necessity of diligently scrutinizing labels and opting for unadulterated, natural edibles becomes evident due to their ubiquity.

### **The Deceptive Nature of Maltitol in Keto Products**

Maltitol might seem like a keto dream come true, but it's more of a wolf in sheep's clothing. With a glycemic index ranging from 57 to 70, maltitol isn't as innocent as it appears.

For perspective, pure glucose sits at the top with an index of 100. Maltitol, though seemingly harmless, can still cause a surge in your blood sugar, jeopardizing your state of ketosis.

#### **Glucose Content in Maltitol**

Buckle up because here’s where things get tricky: half of maltitol is glucose. Yes, that molecule with a glycemic index score hitting the roof at 100. If staying in ketosis was your goal, maltitol could be secretly sabotaging your efforts without you even realizing it.

## Is tuna good to consume on Keto?

Yes you can. Some types of tuna are good to consume, and certain types are bad. The “bad” types contain excessive amounts of mercury – 3 times as much as the “good” tuna varieties contain. Mercury interferes with certain enzymes involving selenium.

Some fish have more selenium than others. The mercury in the environment that the fish are exposed to might not affect you too much if the fish is high in selenium. This is because selenium can counter mercury. But if there is too much mercury in the fish, it can lock up the selenium enzymes, making them inactive.

This can create a lot of different symptoms, including:

* Tremors
* Headaches
* Nausea
* Insomnia
* Muscle weakness
* Twitches
*   Mood swings

    Types of tuna that have lower amounts of mercury:
* Skipjack tuna
*   Canned light tuna

    Types of tuna that have high amounts of mercury:
* Albacore tuna (canned white tuna)
* Ahi tuna (yellowfin tuna and bigeye tuna)

## Is Yacon syrup keto-friendly and safe to consume?

It is definitely not keto-friendly! Though certain people will say that you can have it on keto and that it will help you lose weight, they are way off with this one. Yacon syrup is extracted from the roots of the yacon plant in Peru.

50% of yacon is made up of FOS, or fructooligosaccharide, which is a prebiotic fiber. If you use yacon and you have any problem with candida, SIBO, leaky gut, or any gut inflammation, you’re going to feel bloated.

30% of yacon is fructose sugar. Fructose can overwhelm the liver and lead to insulin resistance and a fatty liver. There was a study that showed that yacon could help you lose weight. However, this was based on a low-fat / low-calorie diet, which is not best for your health. Overall, yacon will spike your blood sugars enough to throw your body out of ketosis and stop fat burning. There are better sweetener alternatives, like allulose, monkfruit, swerve, stevia. Try those instead.

## Keto Biscuits Recipe

A lot of people love to have a nice biscuit or piece of bread with butter. While on the ketogenic diet, you can have grass-fed butter, but traditional breads and biscuits are not an option. This is the perfect low-carb alternative if you’re on the keto diet, but you still want to have something that’s like bread or a biscuit. Put grass-fed butter on it or oil with Italian spices. They’re easy and delicious.

These biscuits are very bread-like, so you could slice it for sandwiches or toast it! Yum! This recipe is for ONE biscuit. But you can easily double it, triple it, etc. - as much as you want and fill as many muffin cups as you like. Make enough, and you can even make a loaf.

**Keto Biscuits Recipe:**

1 tbl coconut flour

2 tbl ground flaxseed

1 egg

1 tsp Kerrygold butter ½ tsp baking powder

2 grinds (pinches) of salt

**Directions:**

Mix and put in greased ramekins/muffin cups/loaf pan. Bake at 350 for 15 minutes. When using a loaf pan, 25 minutes will be needed. Test with knife or toothpick, to see to it that it comes out clean and to ensure doneness.

Enjoy!

## Keto Broccoli Fritters Recipe

These green broccoli fritters are really yummy. I recommend you serve them warm, with some sour cream or plain yogurt. The texture is great, and the flavor is subtle. Give them a try! Here's how to make keto-friendly broccoli fritters at home:

**Ingredients:**

• 1 Cup steamed broccoli

• 2 Eggs

• 1/2 tsp curry powder

• ¼ tsp sea salt and pepper to taste

• Coconut oil

• (may need a little coconut flour)

**Directions:**

• In a food processor, pulse the broccoli until finely ground. Pulse eggs, curry powder, salt, and pepper. The batter should be thick enough to hold a pancake shape in the pan. If it's too watery, add coconut flour (1 tsp) and blend again. Blend until thick and smooth.

• Heat skillet to medium-high. I love cast iron. Always fully heat the cast iron first and add oil. Drop about 2 tbsp. of "batter" into the hot pan for each fritter. Brown on one side before turning. You can peek under to see if it's ready. Flip and brown the other side.

Enjoy!

## Keto Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe

It’s hard to make chocolate chip cookies that taste good and are still keto-friendly and low carb. Getting the consistency right can be tricky. But, we’ve done it.

This is a really easy recipe that we actually got off of the almond flour bag we bought, and Karen Berg just changed it a tiny bit. Almond flour is so easy to get, and it’s an excellent flour alternative. Instead of using brown sugar, Karen uses white powder sweetener with a tiny touch of molasses.

Enjoy these cookies with a meal.

**How to make Dr. Berg-approved Chocolate Chip Cookies**

**Ingredients:**

½ cup butter, stored under room temperature

¼ cup sugar substitute (I use Just Like Sugar.)

¼ cup brown sugar (as a sugar-free substitute.

I use ¼ cup of Just Like Sugar PLUS 1 tsp of Black Strap Molasses.)

1 tsp vanilla

1 egg, plus

1 egg white

2 ½ cups almond flour

1 ¼ cup sugar-free chocolate chips (I use King Arthur’s brand.)

½ tsp baking soda

¼ tsp salt

**Directions:**

In a medium bowl, mix all wet ingredients and beat until creamy.

In a larger bowl, mix all dry ingredients.

Add water to dry and mix well, into a dough. Make into balls (Choose the size!). Press slightly using your palm, as these do not spread as they bake. But don’t make them too thin, as they have a GREAT consistency when they are about ½ inch thick.

Bake at 350 for about 13-15 minutes, and get slightly brown on top. Do not overbake.

If necessary, take out one early and let it cool to check consistency. You can always put the cookies back in for a minute to firm them up. Ovens cook differently, so I go for a shorter time and test, and pop back in the oven if I need to.

Enjoy!

## Keto Chocolate Mousse Pudding Recipe

This is a delicious low-carb keto recipe that’s super easy to make. It’s a perfect chocolate recipe for the holidays, or really all year round! You can also add your own homemade whip cream and drizzle some sugar-free chocolate on top.

**Sugar-free Chocolate Mousse Pudding (Credit to Lisa - Low-carb Yum)**

**Ingredients:**

1 tsp unflavored gelatin powder

1 tbsp cold water

2 tbsp boiling water

1/3 cup of powdered sugar substitute (Just Like Sugar™)

1/4 cup of cocoa powder

1 cup heavy whipping cream, chilled (grass-fed and organic)

1 tsp vanilla

**Directions:**

Add 1 cup of cold water and pour in the gelatin powder. Let it stand for a minute.

Then add boiling water and stir until completely dissolved.

Stir all other ingredients together and beat with a hand beater, scraping sides and bottom to mix all well, until stiff.

Then add gelatin and mix again to incorporate all ingredients.

Spoon into small serving dishes and chill.

Top with sugar-free whipped cream (if you want):

½ cup heavy whipping cream (organic, of course)

1/2 tsp, vanilla, and 3 drops of stevia.

Whip with a hand beater until stiff.

Enjoy!

## Keto Chocolate Seed Treat

Nuts are heavy on the gallbladder. So, I wanted to make a healthy treat that had a low amount of chocolate, and I didn’t want to use nuts. So, I used seeds instead. I used sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds. Both sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds are packed with protein, fiber, healthy fats, and vitamins.

**Only eat these with a meal, NOT between meals.**

**RECIPE:**

5 cups of seeds.

Use 2 1/2 cups of roasted salted sunflower seeds and 2 1/2 cups of roasted salted pumpkin seeds.

9 ounces of Lily's chocolate chips. You could use Simply Lite Chocolate (3 bars) with maltitol but it can create more digestive gas for some people.

1-3 tbs of coconut oil.

1 tsp of vanilla extract.

Sea salt (pinch) if your seeds are not salted

**Directions:**

Melt chocolate and coconut oil

Mix in chocolate and oil to seed mix

Add vanilla extract and salt if needed

Spread over a tray with parchment paper

Put in freezer for 15 minutes to 1 hour

**Enjoy!**

## Keto Cinnamon Roll Bites Recipe

If you're on a low-carbohydrate diet, this is the perfect alternative to cinnamon rolls. This is a small recipe, perfectly proportioned. It's a great recipe to have on hand if you're on a low-carbohydrate diet, and you want a healthy treat.

**Low-carb Cinnamon Roll Bites**

**Ingredients:**

This is a small batch recipe that will yield about 8 roll bites.

* 1 scoop vanilla protein powder (I recommend pea protein/Stevie blend.)
* ½ tsp baking powder
* 1 tbl coconut flour
* ½ tsp cinnamon
* 1 tbl powdered sugar-free sweetener of choice
* 1 large egg
* ¼ cup unsweetened almond milk
* ¼ tsp vanilla extract

**Directions:**

Mix all dry ingredients together. Beat egg. Add vanilla and milk and mix well. Add wet ingredients to dry and mix well with a wooden spoon, until well-blended.

Spray the mini muffin pan or use paper muffin cups. Put one heaping teaspoon of batter into each well/cup. Bake at 350 for 13 minutes (or until a toothpick is clean when pulled from roll). Remove carefully from the pan and cool on a rack.

For a sweeter, more traditional cinnamon roll, you can mix a tsp of sugar alternative fine powder sweetener like "Just Like Sugar for Baking," with 2 tsp melted coconut oil or butter, and a pinch of cinnamon or as desired. Mix and drizzle over roll when fully cooled.

## Keto Cranberry Pecan Muffins Recipe

These low-carb cranberry pecan muffins are amazing, and they are completely keto-friendly. There is no regular flour or sugar in this recipe. I like to use Kerrygold grass-fed butter on top. Even my kids love these delicious muffins, and I think you're going to love them too.

The cranberries in this recipe are ok because cranberries are tart, they don't have a lot of sugar. You're also allowed between 20 and 50 grams of carbs per day with a ketogenic diet. You don't have to feel deprived on the ketogenic diet. Great recipes like this one are delicious and will even make the house smell great!

**Cranberry Pecan Muffins Recipe**

**Ingredients**

• ½ cup sour cream

• 4 large organic, pasture-raised eggs

• 1 tsp vanilla

• 3 cups almond flour

• ½ tsp cinnamon

• 2 tsp baking powder (aluminum-free)

• ½ cup sugar-free sweetener (I use Just Like Sugar)

• ¼ tsp salt

• 1 cup fresh or frozen/thawed cranberries (If frozen, they must be fully thawed and drained.)

• ½ cup pecans (nuts are optional)

**Directions**

1\. Preheat oven at 325°F.

2\. Line the muffin tin with cups or use silicone liners.

3\. In a blender, mix sour cream, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, baking powder, sweetener, and salt. Blend until well-mixed.

4\. Add almond flour mixture a bit at a time and blend. If it gets too thick, add water until it can blend into a batter. Mix well.

5\. Add cranberries and nuts and mix with a spatula. (If it's easier for you, you can pour the batter into a large bowl or mix the whole thing in a bowl. You'll still end up with yummy cranberry muffins.)

6\. Using a ¼ cup or a spoon, pour the batter into the muffin cups, dividing the batter evenly into 12.

7\. Bake for 25-30 minutes until the muffins are slightly brown and firm to touch. Let them cool at room temperature because warm muffins will stick to the paper.

Cool on a wire rack.

## Keto is Beneficial for Athletic Performance

In 2012 there was a study, which I linked to below this video, that keto doesn’t affect the strength performance in elite gymnasts. A 2018 study, also linked below, shows that keto reduces oxidative stress and inflammation in deep sea divers. When you run your body on ketones, you get less oxidative stress, meaning that your organs and tissues don’t break down as easily.

Yet another study of cyclists showed that keto didn’t compromise their endurance. Two of the top ultramarathon runners are both on keto. One of them, Zach Bitter, took the US record for a 100 mile event. It’s not carbs that build muscle, it’s protein. Strength training also builds muscle. While it’s true that insulin is anabolic, which helps your muscles grow, Two things stimulate insulin; one is carbs, the other is protein.

When you do the keto diet, you go low carb. When you go low carb, and combine it with intermittent fasting, you fix something called insulin resistance. Most of the population has this. Your cells need evermore insulin to offset the effect of eating too many carbs. When you fix insulin resistance, you increase the absorption of amino acids. Your body uses insulin more effectively. When you do a healthy keto plan, your body runs on ketones, fatty acids, and part of it still uses a little bit of glucose. Even though you’re not consuming glucose, your body has the ability to make its own in the liver, a process called gluconeogenesis.

When you start keto, you go through keto adaptation. You may experience fatigue. Increase your B vitamins and minerals. This is a temporary phase. Once you tap into your fat reserves, your performance will improve. You’ll have more endurance. Some athletes become fat burning machines. The truth is, when you eat high carb, you’ll feel more fatigued and your performance will suffer. You’ll have higher insulin along with blood sugar issues and more oxidative stress. Now you can see why the keto diet is actually beneficial for athletic performance.

## Keto Kale Shake without Fruits or Berries

I want to tell you about making kale shakes without berries or fruit since some people don’t want the carbohydrates those items contain. First, blend the kale. I use the organic frozen kale from Trader Joe’s, and fill the blender about two-thirds full with the frozen kale.

Next, I add water to the same level as the kale, then blend for four minutes. Make sure you use a high-powered blender, or else the kale doesn’t come out smooth. The reason I blend the kale first is that otherwise, it foams up too high if you put in other ingredients before blending it.

Then add the rest of the ingredients, blending briefly after you add each one: one to three teaspoons of lemon juice, which helps prevent kidney stones and calcium deposits. One scoop of raw wheatgrass juice powder, lemon-flavored, which contains stevia and adds some sweetness without the carbs. One teaspoon of electrolyte powder, to get the benefit of its trace minerals and extra potassium.

Be sure to blend only briefly! If you do it too long, the shake will foam and overflow the blender. If you want to consume this shake as a meal, add one teaspoon of coconut oil. You can add more if you want. This gives you some seriously good fat. I love 100 percent organic, virgin, cold-pressed, and unrefined coconut oil.

There aren’t many carbs in the kale and low in protein. This is a very low-glycemic drink. If you’re on a two-meal per day schedule, you can drink this shake during your eating window, or in the morning when you wake up. What I do is drink half of it with a meal, wait an hour, then drink the rest. I store the shake in mason jars.

This shake is sometimes my entire salad for the day! It doesn’t really matter exactly when you drink it, it’s a matter of how much you can consume with a meal without feeling stuffed. If you need to, break it up into portions and consume a little at a time.

## Keto Low Carb Blueberry Mini Bites

If you're on a low-carb diet weight loss journey, this is a fantastic keto-friendly low-carb recipe for muffin bites that you can have as a healthy treat when you really need one.

Right now, there is a craze called mug cakes. It's a really cool concept that you have a small number of ingredients that you mix in mug and pop in the microwave to have as a single serving cake. This is a cool theory, but it relies on a microwave, which we don't feel good about using.

These recipes turn out way better in the oven over the microwave anyway. We also realized that having a mug full of cake was just too much. So, we made these muffin bites that are perfectly proportioned, they don't have regular sugar or flour, and they're delicious!

Have these delicious muffin bites with a meal. Low Carb Blueberry Muffin Bites

**Makes 8 bites. Ingredients:**

1 tbl coconut flour

2 tbl almond flour

3 tbl frozen blueberries

**Directions:**

Grease a mini muffin pan or use cups.

Mix all dry ingredients. Separately, mix all wet ingredients.

Blend wet into dry and mix well with wooden spoon until most lumps are gone.

This recipe tends to produce a VERY runny batter. No worries. Pour into cups or wells until about half full, or distribute evenly until all batter has been used.

Bake at 350 for about 12 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.

Gently remove from pan and cool on rack. Enjoy!

Remember, if you're on healthy keto, to have just one of these homemade pizza fat bombs with a meal or after a meal to help you stay full for longer. You could also have a few of these as a meal, just not as a snack. Another great way to have these is as an appetizer. If you do have these as an appetizer, just be sure to still have them within your eating window.

**Keto Pizza Fat Bomb Recipe:**

**Ingredients:**

* 8 oz cream cheese (1 package, organic)
* 24 slices of organic pepperoni (One small package will do- organic.)
* 16 large pitted black olives
* 4 tbsp sun-dried tomato pesto
* 6 tsps dried basil salt/pepper to taste

**Directions:**

* Dice pepperoni and olives.
* Mix: cream cheese, basil, pesto, salt, and pepper.
* Add pepperoni and olives.
* Roll into balls. (If you chill the mixture for about 30 minutes first, rolling will be much easier, but you can do it right away if you don't want to wait!)
* Using a toothpick, stick olive, basil leaf, cream cheese ball and lastly, stick a slice of pepperoni. You can get really creative with this part. Add a slice of jalapeño, or a chunk of sausage! Whatever you love on your pizza!

## Keto Quiche Recipe

If you’re in a rush or maybe you even hate to cook, this quick and simple recipe is for you. You can make this keto-friendly quiche recipe in advance to enjoy later. You can also make the pie crust and egg mixture separately and freeze them both to have on hand. You can double or triple this recipe to make a variety of quiches to freeze and have at any time of the day. What Karen Berg did, was made a large batch of the egg mixture, poured it into six different pie crusts, and then filled them with different things. You can really customize these however you’d like.

**The different keto-friendly quiches Karen Berg made are:**

• Chicken and sharp cheddar

• Veggie

• Bacon, onion, and cheddar

• Ham and swiss

• Spinach and salmon

• Cheese and sausage

The crust for this quiche is not wheat. It’s made with almond flour. These crusts are also super fast and easy to make.

**The secret if you want a quiche with different things in it: Cook the meat and saute the vegetables ahead of time, add those ingredients to the crust first, then pour the egg on top of that.**

**Here’s how to make quiche at home:**

1\. Mix together 3 eggs, 1 cup of organic milk, 1/2 cup organic cream, and 1 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper, 1/2 tsp. chives

2\. Fill your keto-friendly pie crust with the cheese/veggies/meat of your choice.

3\. Pour the wet ingredients into the pie crust 4. Bake at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes

## Keto Vanilla Chia Pudding Recipe

This low-carb vanilla chia pudding makes a great ketogenic snack. It contains chia seeds, which gives it a great consistency. Not to mention, chia seeds are really healthy. Chia seeds have omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, they're high in protein, and they're nutritious. Women especially need omega 3 fatty acids to help balance hormones. We sweeten this with vanilla cream stevia.

**Vanilla Cream Chia Pudding**

**What you need:**

30oz Almond/Coconut Milk (or your favorite)

½ Cup Chia Seed (can add more for thicker texture)

¼ tsp Vanilla Cream Stevia (or to taste)

1 Quart Mason Jar

Pour milk into mason jar, leaving about an inch of room at the top.

Add stevia and chia seed and immediately put on top and shake.

Leave on its side on counter or in fridge for about 10 minutes and shake again.

Then put in fridge for a few hours to thicken.

**Enjoy!**

## Keto Zucchini Goat Cheese Rolls

This homemade zucchini goat cheese roll recipe is a great low-carb snack. But, by snack, we mean that you should have them more as a small meal rather than in-between your meals. Zucchini can be pretty bland, but this healthy keto recipe really spices it up. This is a zucchini roll with herb goat cheese and capers. It’s really lovely and delicious. You can make these rolls as small or as large as you want. They also make a really beautiful side dish.

**ZUCCHINI GOAT CHEESE ROLLS**

**Ingredients:**

* zucchini goat cheese (or your favorite soft cheese)
* Your favorite herbs (or make it easy and buy herb cheese!).
* You can go Italian, with oregano and garlic, or savory, with Thyme and parsley - whatever you like.
* capers

**Directions:**

* Mix herbs into cheese until fully blended.
* Slice zucchini thinly, about 1/8 inch.
* Press slices between two paper towels to pull out extra moisture.
* Grill until tender, or bake at 375 until tender but not mushy for about 15 minutes.
* Cool slightly. Press again between paper towels.
* Spread cheese onto ¾ of zucchini slice.
* Add 2-3 capers to the end with cheese on it.
* Roll them up! You can put toothpick in them or just rest on a plate and serve.
* The larger/thicker the slices of zucchini, the larger the roll.
* For small bites (appetizers) you’ll want to keep them thinner. But a larger roll is a gorgeous side, for the dinner plate.

**Enjoy!**

## Ketogenic Hush Puppies Recipe

A lot of people on the ketogenic diet have this idea that you have to give up a lot of your favorite foods. But, what they may not know is that a lot of your favorite foods cab become keto-friendly foods with just a few adjustments—this the case for these delicious ketogenic hush puppies.

For this recipe, I salted the tops of the hush puppies at the very end with sea salt to give them a little something extra. But, salt is actually very important for your health. This can be a great salty alternative to chips and other unhealthy salty foods. If you’re on keto, it’s important to consume 1 tsp. of sea salt per day. If you don’t, you will have more cravings for chips and those other unhealthy salty foods. Always use sea salt.

**Ketogenic Hush Puppies Recipe:**

**Ingredients:**

* 1 cup Almond Flour
* 1 Tbsp. Baking Powder
* 1/2 Tbsp. Garlic Powder
* 1/2 cup Cheddar Cheese
* 1 Large Egg
* 1/2 cup Half and Half
* 8-10 Drops Stevia
* 4 Scallions
* Pinch of Sea Salt
* 2 Cups of Oil - avocado oil or any oil with a high smoke point - meaning that it will not burn at high temperatures.
* So stay away from Coconut Oil or Extra Virgin Olive Oil for deep frying because these have a low smoke point and will burn.

**Instructions:**

1\. Add Almond Flour and Baking Powder in a bowl

2\. Add Garlic Powder

3\. Mix well

4\. Add Cheddar Cheese and egg

5\. Add Half and Half

6\. Mix

7\. Add Stevia Drops

8\. Chop 4 Scallions and Add

9\. Mix Well

10\. Add a Pinch of Salt

11\. Add to cooking pot 2 cups of oil over medium heat

12\. Once the Oil is at a temperature of 350 degrees, use a scooper and gently drop the formed hush puppies into the Oil. Do not overcrowd.

13\. Cook until golden

**For Dipping Sauce:**

2 tbsp. Mayo

1/4 Cup Sour Cream

1 tbsp. Chili Sauce (Like Sriracha)

1\. Add mayo, sour cream, chili sauce

2\. Mix well.

## My cholesterol levels are too high on keto. Why?

Cholesterol is present in your fat cells. As you lose weight, your body is releasing your fat and cholesterol from your fat cells. This is why your cholesterol can go up, at least temporarily, when you start a ketogenic diet. However, most people find their cholesterol reduces.

## Optimal Vegetable Choices During Ketosis

### **Optimal Vegetable Choices During Ketosis**

So, how can you minimize the risk of diarrhea while still getting the nutrients you need from vegetables? The key is to choose options that are gentler on your digestive system.

#### **Easily Digestible Vegetables for Keto Dieters**

Some of the best vegetables to consume during ketosis include green lettuce, cucumber, tomato, zucchini, bell pepper, and bean sprouts. These options are lower in fiber and more accessible for your gut microbiome to handle.

You can also try cooking your vegetables instead of eating them raw, as this can make them easier to digest. Steaming, sautéing, or roasting are all excellent options.

Focusing on these easily digestible vegetables can help prevent diarrhea and other digestive disturbances while still providing the nutrients your body needs to thrive on a keto diet.

## Should I cycle carbs on Keto?

The answer is no. You don't need carbs - there are no essential carbs. Your body can make glucose out of protein or fat. The goal is to build up your health reserve so high that you can afford an occasional deviation from your healthy eating plan.

***

## Should I do juicing while on Keto or while fasting?

In general, I do not think that juicing is the best idea on keto or while fasting—unless you’re doing a juice powder. Why? Because many vegetable juices can contain more carbs than you would expect. In turn, this can low down ketosis and weight loss.

When calculating the carbs in a vegetable, you want to subtract the fiber from the total carbs, which will give you the net carbs. Juicing removes the fiber from the vegetables, which means you can no longer subtract it from the total carbs. One cup of juice will have more net carbs than one cup of whole vegetable because of the fiber content.

Additionally, juicing can remove a lot of the phytonutrients in vegetables. Phytonutrients have powerful health benefits. If you find it difficult not to have juice because of cravings, try using inositol. This is a form of natural sugar alcohol (known as vitamin B8) that helps with insulin resistance. If you can repair insulin resistance, you will have a much easier time fighting off cravings.

Bile salts can also help reduce cravings. Bile helps you break down and absorb healthy fats that keep you feeling satisfied after eating.

## Should I quit consuming sugar?

Sugar consumption is linked to a host of negative health effects, including diabetes, asthma, depression, stroke, heart attack, gout, hypertension, dementia, cancer, and early death. Even individuals with a healthy weight can suffer from metabolic syndrome due to high sugar intake. Sugar, especially fructose, is deemed as toxic as alcohol, supporting harmful industries and harming the body. Transitioning to keto-friendly desserts and sugar-free chocolate can help reduce sugar intake and promote better health.

***

## Should I reduce carbs or sugar on Keto?

When you’re doing keto, you want to count net carbs, not total carbs. Net carbs are calculated by taking the total carb count of food then subtracting the fiber content. Although fiber is a carbohydrate it has no effect on insulin. The less fiber the more food will spike your blood sugar thus raising insulin. Always focus on net carbs and keep them between 20 and 50 grams daily, or even fewer if you have a slow metabolism or you want to lose more weight. Don’t even factor in veggies if they’re leafy greens. Avoid tomatoes, carrots, and beets because their carb count is high.

You also need to understand the glycemic index, which indicates how foods affect your blood sugar. Items that have less fiber and more sugar will spike your blood sugar more quickly than foods that are higher in fiber. Fiber buffers the sugar response.

Take a potato as an example. A raw potato has a lot of fiber which lowers its net carb count. But as soon as you fry, bake, or mash it, its sugar count climbs astronomically. Or, for instance, one slice of bread has a net carb count of just over 10 grams or almost half of your desired daily amount. Not only is bread high on the glycemic index but the specific fiber, which is from grains, has phytic acid which depletes certain minerals, especially zinc. And it has gluten, which many people are sensitive to. So I don’t recommend grains or grain fiber. You want to get your fiber from vegetables. And you want to avoid starches like rice.

What about fruit? Well, for example, an apple has a net carb count of just over 20 grams. And it has 19 grams of sugar! Berries are much better because they have more fiber and less sugar, and are lower on the glycemic index. In other words, you have to take fiber, net carbs, and glycemic index into account when you’re considering whether to consume a certain food. Also become aware of something called the insulin index, which states how much a particular food will affect your insulin level.

## Should I take exogenous ketones to help me be successful on keto?

You probably don’t need this if you are doing the ketogenic diet for real, eating healthily and doing intermittent fasting.

Exogenous means coming externally to the body, versus endogenous which means coming directly from the body. Exogenous ketones have become increasingly popular – promoting getting into ketosis within 3 hours. But doing this doesn’t emphasize correcting your diet, and it doesn’t require you to cut your carbs as low.

Using this sort of product completely defeats the purpose of keto and intermittent fasting. Taking these ketone salts doesn’t necessarily mean that your body is burning your own fat as fuel; you could actually just be burning ketones from the supplement and might not even lose any weight.

When you are on the ketogenic diet you create your own endogenous ketones by decreasing your carbs and using your own body fat as fuel.

## The Keto-Friendly Snack - Olives

The [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-ketogenic-diet-plan-for-beginners) is a high-fat, low-carb eating plan that has gained popularity recently for its potential weight loss and health benefits. Olives fit perfectly into a ketogenic diet, as they are high in healthy fats and low in carbs.

Snacking on olives can help you stay in ketosis, a metabolic state in which your body burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates.

#### **Fermentation's Role in Reducing Lectins**

Olives undergo a fermentation process that enhances their flavor and makes them more digestible by reducing harmful compounds called lectins.

Lectins are proteins found in many plant foods that can interfere with nutrient absorption and cause digestive issues in some people.

The fermentation process used to cure olives helps break down lectins, making the olives easier to digest and less likely to cause gastrointestinal discomfort. This is good news for people with sensitive digestive systems or those following lectin-free diets.

## The Role of Keto in Stye Prevention

It might come as a shock that what you eat could affect your ocular health, even for styes. Yes, even those pesky styles. A ketogenic diet, focusing on healthy fats and reduced carbohydrates, may be an effective way to improve eye health.

Firstly, it's crucial to understand how this works. A [keto diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/keto-diet-for-beginners) may help regulate insulin levels. Insulin resistance is often linked with immune system impairment, which we know plays a role in stye formation. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2903931) supports this theory.

Besides managing insulin levels, the ketogenic diet also boosts the intake of essential nutrients like vitamins A and D and zinc – all critical for maintaining good eye health.

These micronutrients are essential for properly functioning our mucous membranes, including those in our eyes.

A word of caution, though - while going keto might sound tempting as a potential way to prevent styes, always remember: moderation is key. Overdoing anything isn't beneficial; balance remains paramount regarding nutrition.

## The Sugar Industry's Influence on Dietary Guidelines

### **The Sugar Industry's Influence on Dietary Guidelines**

Did you know the sugar industry holds significant sway over our dietary guidelines? They make up only 2% of farms but account for a third of all donations from US agriculture.

It's like David throwing stones at Goliath, except this time, David has a serious sweet tooth.

#### **Unveiling the Power of Lobbyists**

Sugar lobbyists have mastered the art of influence to shape dietary recommendations. Just imagine them as puppeteers controlling how we perceive and consume sugar in our diets.

Their tactics are subtle yet effective, like adding just enough sugar to your coffee without making it overly sweet.

Their power extends far beyond merely advocating for their interests. They're also skilled in altering perceptions about food pyramid recommendations—twisting scientific facts into knots that even Houdini would struggle with.

#### **Discrediting Anti-Sugar Research**

Besides shaping guidelines, these clever folks are adept at undermining research suggesting harm from high-sugar consumption—it’s as if they've turned deflecting criticism into an Olympic sport.

In their world, science isn't always black or white; it's often coated with a layer of sugary deception.

As cunning as foxes sneaking through henhouses under the moonlight, they work tirelessly to discredit any evidence that paints sugar in less than glowing terms.

### **The Surprising Truth About Obesity and Metabolism**

Contrary to commonly assumed, not all obese people have a [slow metabolism](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-fix-a-slow-metabolism); research has revealed that approximately 20% maintain regular metabolic rates. Studies show that around 20% of obese individuals carry standard metabolic rates.

#### **Obesity Doesn't Always Mean Poor Metabolism**

You may be astounded to find out that some people classified as overweight have normal metabolisms.

They defy the stereotype of [obesity](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-answer-to-obesity-is-obvious-if-you-look-at-the-statistics), leading inevitably to diabetes or heart disease. Just like you can't judge a book by its cover, you can't predict an individual's health based on weight alone.

Despite carrying extra pounds, they avoid the common trap of developing insulin resistance - a critical factor in metabolic syndrome and related conditions such as [type 2 diabetes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-to-eat-to-correct-diabetes) and cardiovascular diseases.

This group is often called "metabolically healthy obese" (MHO), but don't be misled – it doesn't imply obesity is good for health.

However, don't let this term fool you – it does not mean obesity is healthy. It merely means these individuals appear resilient against the usual detrimental effects of excess body fat.

[Research suggests](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22804876), though somewhat controversially due to conflicting findings from various studies, about one-fifth of those who are clinically defined as 'obese' actually fall into this MHO category.

This throws up fascinating questions for scientists looking at how we approach dieting strategies and overall health promotion.

### **The World Health Organization's Stance on Sugar Consumption**

The World Health Organization (WHO) has a clear-cut guideline regarding the daily sugar intake. According to them, your sweet tooth should be limited to 12 teaspoons of added sugar daily.

It's easy to see how quickly we can surpass the WHO recommendation of no more than 12 teaspoons of added sugar per day when one soda contains nearly that amount. And what happens if we do?

Things start getting sticky – not in the fun caramel way.

#### **The Not-So-Sweet Consequences**

High consumption may lead to numerous health issues, including diabetes and heart disease. It's almost as if consuming too much sugar is akin to inviting unwanted guests into our bodies - they're hard to get rid of once they've made themselves comfortable.

In other words, while enjoying sweets now and then won't cause any harm, consistent overconsumption could turn life sour fast.

## Transforming Your Burger Experience on Keto

### **Transforming Your Burger Experience on Keto**

Bibb butter head lettuce isn't just a salad ingredient anymore. Now, this verdant option provides an excellent and crunchy substitute for the usual bread slices surrounding your burger.

Its sturdy leaves can hold up to even the juiciest of burgers, ensuring you get that satisfying crunch with every bite.

But it's not all about texture; choosing lettuce over bread slashes carbs and adds [nutrients like vitamin A](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-is-vitamin-a-named-retinol) and potassium to your meal. Switching to lettuce isn't just a minor change; it infuses your keto journey with nutritional perks and a burst of taste.

#### **Portobello Mushroom Caps**

If you're craving something more substantial than lettuce, roasted portobello mushroom tops are here to save the day. These savory caps provide a meaty base that complements any burger patty perfectly.

The best part? They soak up flavors like nobody’s business—think garlic, herbs, or marinades—that elevate your burger from good to gourmet in minutes.

Moreover, they're scant in [carbohydrates](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-carb-more-deadly-than-sugar-surprising) yet abundant in fiber and protein, offering a dual advantage for those vigilant about their nutritional intake.

#### **Napa Cabbage for an Asian Twist**

Napa Chinese cabbage brings something entirely different to the table—an Asian twist with its unique peppery taste and crunchy texture. Just imagine wrapping a spicy pork or beef patty in these crispy leaves.

This choice is exceptionally splendid if you aim to diversify your [keto diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/when-to-change-your-keto-diet) while keeping carbs at bay. Napa cabbage also boasts impressive amounts of folate and vitamins K and C.

## What about keto for a newborn?

During pregnancy, 30% of the energy supplied to the baby is from ketones, which continue to be utilized after birth. Ketones, abundant in breast milk, serve as crucial brain fuel for infants, supporting brain development. Breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition for infants, promoting healthy brain function, bone formation, and disease prevention.

## What are Dr. Berg's thoughts on products that are full of ketones?

There are products available that either convert to ketones, such as MCT oil, or contain exogenous ketones that can be consumed directly. These products range in price, with both premium and more affordable options on the market. While they may provide some benefits, particularly for individuals engaged in competitive exercise seeking additional energy, the overall enhancements in performance or well-being can be modest—primarily manifesting as improved mental clarity or energy.

In specific clinical scenarios, such as managing conditions like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, or dementia, the intake of ketone products can offer significant advantages. Ketones can serve as an alternative energy source for the brain, which may preferentially utilize ketones over glucose. This can be particularly beneficial for bypassing damaged neurons that struggle to metabolize glucose, thus potentially supporting cognitive function in affected individuals.

As with any supplement, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most suitable approach for your specific needs.

## What are effective ways to increase energy levels while following a ketogenic diet?

Feeling tired on keto can result from poor sleep, stress, nutritional deficiencies, or the adaptation phase as your body transitions to burning fat. Increasing B vitamins or potassium may help.

Fatigue can also be linked to mitochondrial health. Mitochondria produce ATP, and oxidative stress from smoking, pollution, and high sugar can damage them. Antioxidants, especially from whole foods like cruciferous vegetables and omega-3-rich sources, help combat this damage.

Avoid synthetic antioxidants; focus on natural sources. If you're not getting enough high-quality vegetables, consider adding a plant-based shake for a week to boost energy. Keto can be challenging, but it’s a protective mechanism worth maintaining!

## What are enzymes?

Enzymes are like tiny little worker bees in your body. They do the work of breaking down carbohydrates, fats, proteins and other raw nutrients.

When you have a meal, you trigger the release of enzymes. Your body tells your pancreas what types of enzymes to release based on the kinds of nutrients you have ingested. Specific enzymes break down specific nutrients.

## What are some examples of healthy keto meals?

Dr. Eric Berg, the Knowledge DocTM shares with you his own keto eating and intermittent fasting routine. If you’re looking for a sample fasting and keto meal plan, or you’re wondering what to eat on keto, this keto-friendly plan is one that really works for him.

**Intermittent fasting routine:**

* I wake up at 5:00 am, and I go to bed at 10:30 p.m. (with intermittent fasting I need less sleep)
* I try to keep my meals within a 3 to 4 hour window so I have around 20 to 21 hours of fasting
* At 5 a.m. I have a small cup of organic coffee with grass-fed half-and-half or heavy cream and one packet of xylitol
* At 6 a.m. I’ll have around 12 to 16 ounces of water with 1 to 2 ounces of organic lemon juice, and take my vitamins
* I have my first meal between 1 and 3 p.m.
* I have my second meal between 5 and 6 p.m.

**Meal 1 example:**

* 4 pasture-raised organic eggs
* 4 oz of organic bacon
* 3 oz high-quality European organic grass-fed cheese (I like sheep cheese and goat cheese)
* 1⁄4 cup olives
* 1 tomato (in moderate amounts, tomatoes are OK on keto)

**Meal 2 example:**

* A big salad (7 to 10 cups): lettuce, bell pepper, tomato (moderate amounts), cabbage, kale, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, balsamic vinaigrette
* A protein (7 oz): sardines (with bones and skin), shrimp, grass-fed and grass-finished hot dogs, organic grass-fed and grass-finished burger, wild-caught salmon, or steak
* Nuts: pecans or pistachios

## What are some Keto-friendly foods?

Dr. Berg talks about Acceptable Pleasure Foods on the ketogenic diet. These foods are not meant to be consumed as a snack but after the meal as a dessert. These recipes are low carb, however, the bread recipe contains a bit more carb due to a tiny bit of molasses and arrowroot flour, however, it's still a lot smaller than typical bread due to no wheat flour. Also, test the waters with these recipes because some people are sensitive to sugar alcohol and can experience some bloating. Then some people consume excess amounts of these treats and because of the delicious recipes, they eat WAY TOO MUCH- so be careful.

## What are the best snack foods for low blood sugar?

A person with low blood sugar might be accustomed to snacks like protein bars and an apple with peanut butter. There is so much hidden sugar in these snacks that such snacks are nor recommended; with them, every time you snack you are worsening the problem of low blood sugar. You can become a real hypoglycemic which is almost a pre-diabetic situation. Normal blood sugars are between 80 to 90, but not over 100.

When you eat a snack, no matter what you snack on, you elevate your sugars. Once the sugar goes high it triggers the hormone insulin to drive the sugar down, so you end up with a low blood sugar situation. Snacking keeps the blood sugar levels going up and down, up and down, and perpetuates the problem.

The way out of this is to change what you eat at your meals. Watch Dr. Eric Berg’s videos about the Healthy Keto® and intermittent fasting plan; this diet will help you keep your blood sugars under control.

## What are the keto food ratios?

The percent of carbs should be 5% of the calories in your diet (low)

Your protein should be roughly 20% (moderate) and

The percent of fat should be 75% (high).

Don’t count carbohydrates from vegetables in this equation since these carbs are mainly fiber and will not raise insulin too much.

Dr. Berg recommends consuming 7 to 10 cups of salad veggies (leafy greens) per day. If you are eating other vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, etc. you would need less (3.5 to 4 cups).

## What are the most common Keto mistakes that slow your progress down?

Common mistakes on keto and how to address them:

1\. **Excessive Fat Consumption:** Focus on reducing carbs rather than adding more fat. Only increase fat intake if you're new to keto and need support during fasting.

2\. **Snacking:** Avoid keto snacks and stick to regular meals to minimize insulin spikes.

3\. **Hidden Carbs:** Check food labels for hidden carbs like maltodextrin. Avoid fruits, berries, and agave nectar.

4\. **Inadequate Protein Intake:** Ensure you're consuming enough quality protein to signal satiety to the brain and prevent deficiencies. Consider amino acid supplements if needed during fasting.

## What are the potential consequences of straying from the ketogenic diet?

When you have a cheat meal and you eat carbs, you spike insulin which then reacts to store glucose. You end up with a low blood sugar situation. This is when hunger sets in, the cravings start, and other negative effects like anxiety happen.

Cheating on keto can kick you out of fat burning for 1 to 3 days.

Of course, when you eat carbs you will feel better, but not for very long. Soon after the carbs, you’re left wanting more and more. By eating carbs you’re also depleting a lot of essential nutrients.

How to recover from a cheat day on keto:

* Drink apple cider vinegar with water
* Start fasting
* Exercise
* Take potassium and sodium
*   Consume B vitamins

## What are the pros and cons of creatine on keto?

It'd probably help you if you want to build some muscle mass and have some energy while you're working out that's when I would recommend that.

Will it knock you out of ketosis? Not of any significant level.

***

## What are the reasons for high creatine on Keto?

First, what is creatinine? It’s a waste product from muscle metabolism. (Side note: a waste product from dietary protein is called urea.) Every day your body converts creatine to creatinine.

**The higher level of creatinine on keto isn’t pathological. Here are the five reasons why they are high:**

1\. Consuming way too much protein, especially cooked meat. Ideally, you want to eat three to six ounces of protein, or as much as seven, at a meal. If you’re a big person perhaps a little more.

2\. Taking too much creatine supplementation; try cutting back

3\. Exercising excessively especially if it’s intense, because of muscle physiology. Cut back and take longer to recover.

4\. Having an injury or inflammatory condition, which could itself be pathological

5\. Having a problem with your gallbladder or liver, which could also be pathological

## What are the side effects of keto beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)?

While beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) supplements may increase ketone levels detected in urine, they don't necessarily promote fat burning or weight loss. In fact, relying on exogenous ketones like BHB may negate the primary goal of ketogenic diets, which is to derive energy from fat stores. A cost-effective alternative to BHB supplements is MCT oil, which can support ketosis and fat burning more efficiently. It's important to consider the potential financial drawbacks of BHB supplements, as they may not provide the desired weight loss benefits.

## What can help me to stop snacking or grazing?

With snacking, you may have a certain time that you have a snack. With grazing, there’s no limit on how much you eat, what you eat, or when you eat. You eat constantly. I believe some of the worst advice a person can give is to snack to prevent overeating.

When people start snacking and grazing, they can get into a cycle of raising their blood sugar and insulin, then dropping their blood sugar. Eating causes hunger about one and a half hours later, especially when consuming carbohydrates. Then, the process repeats. If someone is stuck in this snacking cycle, eventually, they could develop high insulin, which could then lead to insulin resistance.

**Eating and depression:** You might feel better temporarily, but then the high insulin could cause depression to worsen.

**Eating when tired:** The more you eat to try to get more energy, the more tired you’ll be.

**Eating when bored or stressed:** The more you eat when bored or stressed, the more you release cortisol, which could cause you to be more stressed.

**Eating carbs for pleasure:** You could spike dopamine, putting yourself at risk for developing dopamine resistance.

**Eating for no reason:** Some people eat because the food is there, and then they get stuck in the snacking trap.

Many people don’t realize that when they do fasting correctly, they can put the body in a condition where there is no hunger or cravings. This is because your body is essentially eating your own fat all day long. Fat generates ketones, which is a clean fuel. You’ll feel good, you could have improved cognitive function, and you could have an enhanced mood.

**What to do:**

1\. Do not eat breakfast (most important)

2\. Understand that eating causes hunger

3\. Do not make junk foods available

4\. Stay very active

5\. Avoid carbs when you eat

## What can I do for tyramine intolerance on keto?

Addressing tyramine intolerance on a keto diet requires careful dietary management. While a long-term keto lifestyle can improve conditions like autoimmune diseases or insulin resistance, it doesn't mean you can revert to previous eating habits that triggered these issues.

**Genetic Factors and Epigenetics**: Even with genetic predispositions, you have the power to influence your health through lifestyle choices. Epigenetics shows that your actions can modify gene expression, helping you control conditions previously thought to be unchangeable.

**Maintaining Progress**: It's essential to avoid foods that contribute to your intolerances and health issues. Your improved health is sustained by continuing to make smart, health-conscious choices, not by returning to problematic foods.

By adhering to a keto diet and focusing on suitable food choices, you can manage tyramine intolerance effectively and maintain your overall well-being.

## What can I do If my L. Reuteri Yogurt comes out too watery?

The watery portion is whey, a natural resultant of the fermentation process. The whey can be stirred into the yogurt and eaten as-is or enjoyed with berries or stevia.

How to Help Reduce the Whey

The more thoroughly and rapidly the components are mixed, the greater the potential reduction in whey.

First, add your starter culture, either an L. reuteri capsule or three tablespoons of yogurt from a previous batch, to your mixing bowl. Then, as you add one tablespoon of inulin, stir vigorously for a few seconds—longer if you're using yogurt from a previous batch. Stir by hand; machine mixing can harm bacteria. Keep your container of organic half-and-half ready near your mixing bowl while you do this.\*\*\*\*

Next, after the starter culture and inulin are mixed immediately add your half and half, it can be more than 2 tablespoons, it can even be 2-4oz, stirring vigorously.

The key is that it all mixes well with no lumps at all, without any sticking to the spoon/fork (which you don't want) or the bottom of the mixing bowl itself, as it's easy to miss, so make sure you do a quick check.

Once quickly and thoroughly mixed, put the mixture in your bowls/ jars evenly (with jars, it helps to use a 1/2 cup measuring cup) and make sure your water levels are even or slightly above the water line just to be sure:)

## What can I do to address sleep problems while following a ketogenic diet?

If you aren’t following Healthy Keto®, you may be lacking sleep-promoting nutrients like B vitamins, magnesium, calcium, and potassium. This deficiency can occur during the transition phase as your body adapts to burning fat for energy—a process that initially leads to increased alertness since fat provides more than double the energy storage potential compared to carbohydrates. As a result, you might feel more awake, while carbohydrates can cause fatigue, often making you feel sleepy after consumption.

To improve your sleep and expedite the transition to ketosis, consider increasing your intake of minerals, particularly potassium, as well as B vitamins, and incorporating more daily exercise to utilize excess energy. Other factors that may contribute to sleeplessness on a ketogenic diet include excessive coffee consumption, not practicing intermittent fasting, low calcium levels, bloating from kale, or waking up due to fluctuations in blood sugar levels. Addressing these issues can help enhance your overall sleep quality while adapting to the ketogenic lifestyle.

## What can I eat for breakfast on keto?

You can consume bacon and eggs, or many other foods, as your first meal of the day. But it’s not recommended that you have a morning meal, because it will cause you to lose the benefits of the morning fasting time added to your fast during the night. Try to push your first meal to a little later in the day – even to noon or early afternoon.

Ideally, you would combine a ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting, to get the most benefits for health and weight loss.

## What cocktails can I drink on keto?

Any cocktail, as long as it doesn’t have carbs and alcohol.

Here’s a refreshing keto cocktail that doesn’t have any alcohol or sugar:

This beautiful drink is perfect for a hot summer day. It has muddled blackberries, lime, lime juice, rosemary, ginger, and a splash of Ginger Ale Zevia to give it some bubbles.

Ginger Ale Zevia, is of course, sugar-free. Blackberries are also lowest of all berries on the glycemic index.

Ginger is great for your digestion, and raw lime is packed with vitamin C. While it’s good to drink plenty of water, it can be nice to switch things up. Give this a try!

## What could be causing my acne after starting the ketogenic diet?

Acne development after initiating a ketogenic diet may indicate that the version of keto you're following is not optimal or that you might be lacking certain essential nutrients. Generally, when adhering to a well-balanced and nutritious ketogenic diet, individuals often see an improvement in skin condition, including a reduction in acne.

One crucial nutrient for preventing acne is vitamin A. The synthetic version of vitamin A, such as Accutane, is used in severe cases, but it is advisable to focus on natural sources instead. Foods rich in retinol, such as egg yolks, liver, and butter, as well as certain dairy products like cheese, can significantly contribute to your vitamin A intake. It's important to note that the form of vitamin A found in animal products is more effective for skin health than the provitamin A found in plant sources. If acne persists, it may be beneficial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations.

## What could be causing my heart palpitations while on keto, and what steps should I take?

## What dietary recommendations do you have for a teenager?

For children and teenagers, I recommend a dietary approach similar to that of adults, while ensuring they receive adequate calories and essential nutrients to support proper growth and development. Depending on individual circumstances, I suggest providing three balanced meals per day without snacks. Although intermittent fasting with two meals may be suitable for adults, it is generally not advisable for growing adolescents unless there are specific weight management concerns.

A healthy version of the ketogenic diet, featuring three well-rounded meals, can be particularly beneficial for the health and development of adolescents. If I were a teenager, given my knowledge of nutrition, this would be the approach I would advocate.

***

## What do I do if I don't feel satisfied after eating on Keto?

There are usually two reasons. Either you’re still having a problem with insulin resistance, or you have a gallbladder issue and aren’t releasing enough bile. If it’s low bile, my gallbladder formula may help.

Typically, though, people have a problem with insulin resistance. With insulin resistance, insulin isn’t connecting to the cell, and you’re unable to absorb nutrients, amino acids, and fuel. You might have to give it more time, but let’s make sure you’re doing keto correctly. You need a lot of vegetables. You don’t want to add carbs, or too much protein, because otherwise, you’ll prolong the insulin resistance.

But you can increase your fat intake. I love pecans; they’re the fattiest nut. Take a handful, and another if you need to until you feel satisfied. Nut butters are great with celery or maybe even carrots. The cheese is good too. Brie is a fatty cheese that will help satisfy you.

Apple cider vinegar is good to consume with a meal. It will help with insulin resistance. I like to consume salad or vegetables first, then protein, then fat. Mainly, give keto and intermittent fasting more time. If you have had a big problem with insulin resistance, it will take a while to heal it. As you do keto correctly, and give it more time, you’re going to start feeling more satisfied. I know keto and intermittent fasting will help you, which is why I urge you to be patient in order to get the outcome you want.

## What do I do if I have hormonal imbalances on Keto?

### **Hormonal Imbalances & Calcium Absorption**

Our bodies are complex systems, with various factors influencing nutrient absorption. Hormonal balance is one such factor. [Hormonal imbalances](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-hormonal-imbalance-really-occurs) can affect the absorption of minerals like calcium, which is crucial for bone health and nerve impulses.

During menopause, hormone levels can vary significantly - particularly a decrease in estrogen - which may lead to decreased mineral uptake, such as calcium.

Postmenopausal women tend to have lower bone density due to reduced calcium absorption, making them more susceptible to osteoporosis.

#### **Balancing Hormones For Improved Mineral Absorption**

The good news? Adopting a healthy ketogenic lifestyle may help. The Healthy Keto Diet focuses on consuming nutrient-dense foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals for optimal body function.

* Foods high in healthy fats (like avocados) support hormone production by providing the necessary building blocks for hormones.
* Maintaining stable blood sugar levels through low-carb intake helps prevent insulin spikes, which could disrupt other hormone balances.
* Plenty of leafy greens provide an excellent source of calcium without the risk associated with dairy consumption.

## What does science say about Keto’s effectiveness?

Science confirms keto is a highly effective tool for preventing or managing insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity, elevated cholesterol, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and PCOS.

Research also suggests that a high-fat diet reduces hunger and cravings, which makes the keto diet a sustainable long-term tool to improve health, maintain a healthy weight, lower the risk of chronic diseases, and potentially increase longevity.

***

## What factors contribute to a decreased appetite while following a ketogenic diet and practicing intermittent fasting?

Some people experience a decreased appetite on the Healthy Keto® diet. Although you are taking energy from your body fat and don’t feel the need of food, it is important to note that food has an additional purpose--to provide nutrients. For example if you are deficient in electrolytes and you don’t eat, you can pass out, have low blood pressure etc. While you may not feel hungry because you’re burning enough fat to keep your body supplied with energy, you still need micronutrients.

**What to do:**

If you aren’t hungry for days at a time, it’s important to still eat a nutrient-dense meal once or twice a day. Make sure the meals that you eat are rich in nutrients. Lowering your fat intake may also help you regain your appetite.

* Don’t stop eating.
  * Eat one good meal per day if you want to lose weight
  * Eat two meals per day if you want to maintain your weight
* You can lower your fat intake gradually (to improve appetite)
*   Avoid appetite blockers.

## What happens when I overeat?

Overeating can lead to increased stress on the digestive system, causing gas, bloating, nausea, and constipation. Regularly elevated insulin levels can result in insulin resistance (prediabetes) and an overworked pancreas. Poor digestion and excess food intake can also decrease sleep quality and cause the body to convert surplus food to body fat. The following day, you may experience increased cravings, moodiness, inflammation, and a slowed metabolism.

## What If I don't consume dairy on Keto - do you have any tips?

I’m going to tell you how to do the keto diet while remaining dairy-free, for those of you who are lactose intolerant or have an allergy to the proteins in dairy. You may also be sensitive to the quality of the dairy since dairy products can contain hormones or come from animals fed with genetically-modified grains.

I personally do well with raw-milk cheese that’s grass-fed and organic. You may want to try dairy products that are grass-fed and organic to see if you tolerate them. Be sure to avoid processed cheese like Velveeta, which is filled with unhealthy ingredients.

If you truly need to adhere to dairy-free eating, there are several healthy alternatives that are totally acceptable on keto. They are coconut products, nuts, and nut butter, olive products and avocados, animal fat, and ghee.

I included ghee, also called clarified butter, even though strictly speaking it’s dairy. But ghee has the milk solids removed, leaving only the fat, which you may be able to eat. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. As you see, there are numerous alternatives.

If you’re sensitive to nuts in addition to adhering to dairy-free eating, that complicates things. You have to remove nuts and nut butter as healthy fats. And if you’re not eating dairy, can’t eat nuts, and are vegan, that really limits your options for healthy fat. However, there are always substitutes. You just have to get creative to be sure you get the correct amount of healthy fat when you’re on keto.

Don’t worry if you avoid dairy. You can be successful on the keto diet by using viable substitutes.

## What is a keto rash?

Dr. Berg’s theory is that there are high levels of histamines being dumped into the liver. When you switch over to the keto diet, or you’re running on ketones, you’re releasing a lot of fat that’s coming out through the liver. That fat holds a lot of stuff like chemicals and toxins.

But if you don’t have a lot of bile in your gallbladder and you do a ketogenic diet, you might not be able to release the toxins that are coming out with the fat. This could create an immune reaction with the histamines. One of the purposes of bile is to break down fats. The other is to eliminate toxins. Basically, you’re trying to get rid of these toxins, but you don’t have enough bile to handle the fat being released on the keto diet, so you end up with a rash.

A great potential keto rash remedy is to add purified bile salts. This could help increase the flow of the bile through the liver and gallbladder to help eliminate toxins a lot better and reduce the keto rash that’s occurring.

## What is a lazy keto?

Lazy keto is when you do not count calories or ketones. You primarily focus on counting carbohydrates–and keeping them below 50 grams per day.

## What is a recommended fat intake on a Keto diet?

When you first start keto and intermittent fasting, you’re going to need more fat. As you progress, you’ll need to consume less fat because your body is eating its own fat. The best way to judge how much fat you need is to base it on your hunger.

Eat enough fat to keep you comfortable and full between meals but not so much that you feel stuffed. On average, you’d consume:

**140 grams per day if you’re consuming three meals; 113 grams per day if two meals;**

**86 grams per day if you’re eating one meal per day.**

The meal plans on drberg.com, under Recipes, already have these keto macro amounts built into them.

## What is a speed keto diet plan?

For those on the Healthy Keto® diet seeking to enhance intermittent fasting, ensure you're already following these steps:

\- Intermittent fasting with 1 to 2 meals within 4 hours

\- Ketogenic diet with less than 20 grams of carbs per day

\- Plenty of salad, moderate protein, and sufficient healthy fats

\- Avoidance of soy oil and regular exercise

To elevate your progress:

1\. Avoid starchy vegetables like squash, corn, and carrots.

2\. Enhance insulin resistance with potassium, Vitamin D, plant-based trace minerals, and Vitamin B1.

3\. Incorporate full-body high-intensity exercise twice a week with adequate recovery.

4\. Manage stress using techniques like acupressure to reduce cortisol levels.

5\. Consider choline supplements if you have a fatty liver.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## What is an example of a weight-loss-friendly drink that is keto-compatible?

This drink will really support those who have high blood sugar, insulin resistance, or diabetes. Mix and then shake:

* 1 tsp. of cinnamon, which has amazing anti-diabetic properties
* 1 tsp. of fresh ginger, which has many phytochemicals that also support your blood sugar
* 1 to 2 Tbsp of apple cider vinegar, which has many benefits as well
* And 2 to 3 Tbsp of lemon juice, which will help prevent kidney stones
* 1 cup of filtered water or carbonated water, such as Pellegrino

## What is an unhealthy type of Ketosis?

The classical ketogenic diet, an unhealthy form of ketosis, is primarily used for children with epilepsy to help reduce seizures. While it effectively induces ketosis, it offers limited nutritional value as it focuses more on inducing ketone production rather than providing a balanced diet. This diet often includes margarine, GMO oils, maltodextrin, soy, and synthetic vitamins.

Critics of ketosis sometimes highlight potential risks, such as kidney stones, elevated uric acid levels, and bad breath, using the classical ketogenic diet as an example. In contrast, a healthy ketogenic diet offers numerous benefits beyond managing epilepsy and is fundamentally different from the classical ketogenic diet.

## What is better on keto, chicken or pork?

You would want to consume fattier proteins on a ketogenic diet. If you compare pork and chicken, pork has a higher fat content. However, you can still consume chicken with the skin to supply yourself with healthy fats.

***

## What is bulletproof coffee, and is it recommended for a ketogenic diet?

Bulletproof coffee is coffee with grass-fed butter, MCT oil / coconut oil, and cream blended into it. It’s consumed in the morning as a meal replacement. It’s a good thing, and can be a great first step to start out with because the fat in the coffee will allow you to go a longer period of time before feeling hungry again.

You should know that bulletproof coffee will trigger insulin a little bit. For most this will not raise blood sugars, but will raise ketones. The added fat can cause your weight loss to slow because your body will convert this fat into ketones and burn it as fuel instead of using your own fat reserve. Once you have become fat-adapted you may want to remove the butter and MCT oil from your coffee.

One bulletproof coffee hack is coffee, MCT oil, xylitol and 100% cacao powder. Xylitol is 30 on the glycemic index, not zero, so it does influence the blood sugars a little bit, but not in a significant way. The 100% cacao enhances cognitive function, it has cardiovascular protection, it helps your blood sugars, it’s anti-inflammatory and it can improve your mood.

***

## What is fat adaptation?

If you aren’t familiar with keto already, the goal is to go from burning sugar (glucose) for fuel to burning fat (ketones) for fuel.

Fat adaptation is a transition from sugar-burning into ketosis (the body burns fat for energy, and if you are doing keto to achieve weight loss, the body burns its own fat).

When you first start keto, here’s what to expect:

* Around 3 days in, you begin burning ketones (instead of glucose)
* At around 1 to 2 weeks, you lose a lot of water weight
* At around 3 weeks, weight loss may slow down temporarily
* At around 4 to 12 weeks, most people become fully fat-adapted (weight loss increases)
*   At around 12 months, athletes become fully fat-adapted

## What is insulin?

Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that lowers blood sugar and allows cells to absorb nutrients. Insulin is like a key that unlocks cells and opens the door to allow glucose and nutrition to go into the cells. Insulin stores sugar in the liver and muscle, in the form of glycogen that is released for quick energy. It is also a fat-making hormone that will convert extra sugar into body fat.

The problem with insulin roots in too much insulin due to too much dietary sugar, as insulin in itself is not bad for your body. High amounts of sugar will trigger high amounts of insulin, and as a result your cells eventually are going to resist excess insulin; initially your pancreas will produce more insulin to counter this resistance. Over time, the pancreas becomes exhausted and produces less insulin leaving the blood sugars uncontrolled. This condition is called insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is behind many body problems, including type 2 diabetes but also metabolic syndrome.

***

## What is Keto adaptation?

Most people have been running their bodies, for their whole lives, on a diet that is mostly carbs. When you are becoming keto-adapted your body will switch to burning fat and ketones instead of blood sugar. This transition can take anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks.

## What is the best keto food after menopause?

Most postmenopausal women go straight for the calcium supplements, like calcium carbonate, to build bone. But this is a mistake. This could potentially increase the risk of heart attacks.

The vitamin they may really need more of is vitamin K2. It’s also important not to go on a low- fat diet.

***

## What is the difference between keto and Atkins?

Here are some of the characteristics of the Atkins diet:

1\. The Atkins diet only recommends 1 to 3 cups of vegetables per day. This is way too low; it can cause a fatty liver.

2\. If you are not hungry, add a protein snack – bad advice because this will stimulate insulin. Protein does increase insulin, which will then cause a lowering of the blood sugars, making you hungry again.

3\. Atkins recommends artificial sweeteners as okay – but most will trigger insulin.

4\. The Atkins diet gives the option of 5 small meals a day. These will trigger insulin release 5 times, knocking you out of fat burning.

5\. Atkins also recommends that you not skip a meal – bad advice because eating in general stimulates insulin. If you’re fasting and burning fat and not hungry why not skip a meal? Your body will then eat its own fat. What do you think you do when you eat breakfast? – You have been fasting all night and you break the fast by eating, hence the name “break-fast.”

6\. The Atkins diet does not put a limit on protein – another bad idea because excess protein blocks fat burning.

## What is the difference between ketogenic and paleo diets?

A paleo diet is a dietary plan based on foods similar to what might have been eaten during the Paleolithic era, which dates from approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago.

A paleo diet typically includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds – foods that in the past could be obtained by hunting and gathering. A paleo diet limits foods that became common when farming emerged about 10,000 years ago. These foods include dairy products, legumes and grains.

Paleo, despite being healthy, allows more carbs from fruit and sweet potato or yams. Paleo also allows you to eat a greater percentage of protein compared to the ketogenic diet, where your only carb source is vegetables and you consume high amounts of fat and moderate amounts of protein.

***

## What is the difference between the traditional keto diet plan and Healthy Keto?

Any type of ketogenic diet, by limiting net carbs, also reduces your fat-storing hormone. To distinguish my keto program from others, I coined the term “Healthy Ketosis.” It’s based on a guiding principle of mine: It’s not “Lose weight to get healthy,” it's “Get healthy to lose weight!” Healthy Keto is groundbreaking because it emphasizes obtaining your required nutrients from high-quality foods such as organic vegetables, full-fat organic dairy, and wild-caught, grass-fed, pasture-raised meat, fish, fowl, and eggs—with the goal to get you healthy to lose weight rather than lose weight to get healthy.

***

## What is the difference between zero-carb and low-carb diets?

It is the carbohydrates that determine whether you would get into ketosis or not. The higher the carbs, the less the ketosis, and the lesser the carb, the deeper the ketosis and ketosis is fat burning. The insulin index is the scale of foods that are non-carbohydrates in nature (like fat and protein) that has the capacity to influence insulin. The glycemic index is the scale of carbohydrates that affect blood sugars.

**Zero Carbs Foods:**

• Meat

• Fish

• Sea Foods

• Sardines

• Butter

• Coconut Oil

• Olive oil

• Whole cream (Heavy)

• Coffee

• MCT oil

**Low Carbs Foods:**

• Egg

• Veggies

• Half and Half

• Hummus

• Berries

• Lemon Juice

• Nuts

• Seeds

• Sour Cream

• Whey Protein

• Olives

• Avocado

***

## What is the impact of frequently alternating between being on and off a ketogenic diet?

While engaging in a ketogenic diet, even intermittently, can yield benefits compared to not following any dietary plan, there are notable considerations. Each time you return to a ketogenic regimen, you may find it increasingly challenging to achieve the same results as before. This is often due to the development of insulin resistance, which can complicate the effectiveness of the diet over time. Therefore, consistency in following the ketogenic principles may be crucial for sustained progress.

***

## What is the main cause of high blood glucose levels when I am in ketosis?

When you do a healthy ketogenic plan and intermittent fasting, you are lowering insulin levels. Insulin suppresses blood sugars but insulin resistance ma still be an issue your body is dealing with. Lower amounts of insulin and insulin resistance cause the blood sugar to spike a little bit higher while you are still in ketosis. In addition, high blood sugar on keto can be caused by excessive protein, too many carbs, frequent meals, or high stress levels.

## What is the most effective diet for reducing belly fat during menopause?

The keto diet is the best diet for menopausal women.

During menopause, women experience a sudden loss of ovarian function. With that comes a spike in insulin, which causes belly fat.

When you go through menopause, your insulin is going to be higher and you’ll have insulin resistance. Here’s the Healthy Keto® way to handle it:

* Cut carbs down to 20 to 50 g per day (eat plenty of vegetables though)
* Moderate protein
* Don’t go low-fat
* Intermittent fasting: 3 meals with no snacks (and if you’re not hungry, don’t eat)

Is keto beneficial to menopausal women? Yes. You want to do keto and get into ketosis, especially if you’re going through menopause. Healthy Keto is the healthiest way, and the lowest- stress way, to lose belly fat.

***

## What is the science behind low-carb diets?

Low-carbohydrate diets work by reducing insulin levels and promoting fat-burning for energy production. When carb intake is minimized, blood sugar levels stabilize, and insulin sensitivity improves.

This leads to reduced hunger cravings and increased satiety after meals, which can result in weight loss over time.

***

## What is too much fat on a ketogenic diet?

Too much dietary fat can cause:

\- Floating stool

\- Bloating

\- No weight loss

\- Right shoulder/rib pain

\- Nausea

\- Oily stool

\- Lack of appetite

If you have these symptoms, reduce fat to 75 grams per day.

For hypoglycemia, you might need more fat but avoid gallbladder overload. Excess fat between meals prevents burning body fat in ketosis. Combine ketosis with intermittent fasting.

Aim for 70% of calories from fat (20-40g per meal). Gradually increase fat to adapt. Once adapted, you'll burn stored fat more efficiently.

## What keto ice cream can I eat on Keto?

Let’s look deeper at a few keto ice cream brands. Most of them contain sugar alcohol called erythritol.

* Enlightened – 7 g sugar alcohol (also has regular sugar)
* Keto – 8 g sugar alcohol / tapioca fiber (which is not keto-friendly)
* Rebel – 9 g sugar alcohol
* Halo – 10 g net carbs (contains wheat flour and sugar)

Most of these brands use a sugar alcohol called erythritol. What’s good about erythritol is that it’s zero on the glycemic index. What’s bad about it is that unless it’s non-GMO, it could be made from GMO ingredients. None of the major brands that advertise keto ice cream have stated that their product was non-GMO.

For something to be keto, it needs to be low-carb. But even that is a loose term with no legal definition.

Some of the other ingredients in keto ice cream:

* Dairy – Is it organic?
* Sugar – You don’t want any sugar
* Wheat – You don’t want any wheat
* Tapioca – You don’t want any tapioca
* Egg yolk – Is it organic?

The biggest problem with every single one of these so-called keto-friendly ice cream brands is an ingredient called MPC (milk protein concentrate). Another name for this would be milk protein isolates. MPC is a group of dehydrated proteins that come from milk. It is a combination of casein, whey protein and other proteins. These proteins have been linked to inflammation in the liver. Something many people don’t realize is that almost all milk-protein concentrates are imported from China and Mexico. These imported products are also not regulated.

You can consume keto ice cream, although it is not recommended to consume on a regular basis or in large amounts. Preferably find an organic one without any sugar (sugar alcohol is okay) and without tapioca, flour or MPC.

## What noodles can I eat on keto?

Konjac noodles are keto-friendly. They are 97% water and 3% fiber. Fiber is a carb, but it doesn’t have any effect on insulin. Other names for konjac noodles are miracle noodles or shirataki noodles.

**This type of fiber can have some interesting effects, including:**

* It may act as a detox
* It may help support weight loss
* It may help loosen mucus

Something to keep in mind about these noodles is that they are flavorless. You’ll have to add things to them to make them flavorful. These noodles do not have the same texture as pasta noodles, but they’re similar. You may also get very thirsty if you consume them.

**Benefits of konjac noodles:**

* They can decrease hunger
* They may help stabilize your blood sugars
* They may help decrease constipation
* They don’t have any calories

**Other keto pasta alternatives:**

* Spaghetti squash
* Zucchini noodles

## What olive oil is the healthiest on keto?

100% organic virgin olive oil.

***

## What sardines can I eat on keto?

Always check the package to make sure that your sardines are in olive oil or water. Soybean oil is full of omega-6 fatty acids. This can nullify the benefits of the omega-3 fatty acids naturally found in sardines.

Soybean oil is the most used oil in America today. It’s also the second most used oil in the world.

Soybean oil is used in everything from fast food to animal feed to canned foods.

Research shows that soy oil can induce obesity and diabetes more than fructose. Soybean oil can also contribute to insulin resistance and fatty liver disease.

Soybean oil affects the hypothalamus, reduces oxytocin and influences over 100 genes in the brain.

Because soybean oil is so heavily processed, it acts as a powerful oxidizer, it is estrogenic, and it can induce inflammation–especially in your arteries.

If all of that isn’t bad enough, soybeans are also GMOs. This means they are exposed to the chemical glyphosate.

In summary, make sure that your sardines do not contain soybean oil. Instead, choose sardines in water or olive oil.

* Tapioca
* Fructose
* Coconut sugar
* Agave nectar
* Honey
* Maple syrup
* Molasses

## What should I do if I can’t make my kids eat healthy foods?

If your child only eats junk food, here’s what you need to know:

1\. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Picky eating often results from deficiencies in nutrients like zinc, DHA, and vitamin B1. These can affect taste, mood, and behavior.

2\. **Common Culprits**: Foods like sugary cereals, french fries, and packaged snacks often contain MSG and refined carbs, which can worsen these deficiencies and increase appetite.

3\. **Healthy Alternatives**: Switch to Healthy Keto® foods. Instead of banning junk food, find healthy substitutes and involve your child in cooking.

4\. **Supplements**: Consider supplements to address nutrient deficiencies and make the transition to healthy eating easier.

## What should I do if I struggle to maintain my diet during my period?

What Should I Do if I Struggle to Maintain My Diet During My Period?

If you find it challenging to adhere to your diet during your menstrual cycle, consider incorporating calcium orotate and magnesium orotate into your regimen. These supplements may significantly alleviate cramping and reduce cravings associated with your period, helping you stay on track with your dietary goals.

***

## What should I do if I'm experiencing hunger and frequent cravings?

Many people worry about cravings when starting a ketogenic diet, but both keto and intermittent fasting can help eliminate them.

High insulin levels lower blood sugar, leading to cravings. Reducing insulin through a low-carb diet is key, as carbs trigger insulin release. While protein can also spike insulin if consumed excessively, it’s important to keep protein intake moderate. Increasing fat consumption is crucial, as fat does not affect insulin, and including plenty of vegetables is beneficial.

The transition from sugar-burning to fat-burning may come with cravings, often lasting about three days. To speed up this process, use electrolyte powder, B vitamins from nutritional yeast, and apple cider vinegar with meals.

If you still feel hungry despite following a low-carb diet, consider these factors:

\- Not practicing intermittent fasting

\- Consuming hidden carbs

\- Low dietary fat

\- Insufficient adaptation time

\- Eating low-nutrient foods

\- Insulin resistance

\- Low bile production

Addressing these issues can help manage cravings and improve your success on keto.

## What should I do if I'm losing too much weight on keto?

**To stop losing weight on a ketogenic diet, consider these strategies:**

1\. Increase Dietary Fat: Use MCT oil to boost fat intake.

2\. Increase Carbohydrates: Aim for a maximum of 50 grams of carbs per day.

3\. Enhance Exercise: Incorporate regular workouts to prevent muscle loss and allow for recovery.

Make sure to consume plenty of vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, and amino acids to avoid nutrient deficiencies. If weight loss persists, increase your meal frequency from one to two meals a day.

**Avoid:**

\- Most grains and fruits (except raspberries and blackberries).

**Acceptable Carbs:**

\- Carrots.

**Recommendations:**

\- Strength Training: Focus on low-rep, high-weight exercises.

\- Add Healthy Fats: Use MCT oil or butter in meals.

\- Try Teeccino: A naturally decaffeinated herbal coffee.

\- Make Keto Bombs: Fat-based snacks to increase calories.

\- Incorporate Nuts and Nut Butters: Such as almond and peanut butter.

These strategies can help stabilize your weight while maintaining a ketogenic lifestyle.

## What steps can I take to successfully return to a ketogenic diet?

To regain consistency on a ketogenic diet, consider the following strategies:

1\. **Maintain a Food Log**: Documenting your meals can help you stay accountable and understand your eating patterns.

2\. **Clarify Your Motivations**: Reflect on your reasons for adopting keto, emphasizing health benefits and the enjoyment of food, including keto-friendly desserts.

3\. **Avoid Cycles of Dietary Change**: Repeatedly switching between diets can confuse your metabolism. Commit to a consistent approach.

4\. **Follow Healthy Keto® Guidelines**: Focus on a diet with moderate protein intake, limit carbohydrates to 10 grams per day if necessary, and ensure a minimum of 75 grams of dietary fat.

5\. **Incorporate Intermittent Fasting**: This practice can enhance metabolic flexibility and support your ketogenic goals.

6\. **Prioritize Sleep**: Adequate rest is essential for metabolic stability.

7\. **Engage in Regular Exercise**: Physical activity contributes to overall health and can aid in maintaining ketosis.

8\. **Manage Stress Levels**: Stress can negatively impact metabolism, so find effective strategies to manage it.

By implementing these practices, you can effectively transition back to a ketogenic lifestyle and enhance your chances of long-term success.

***

## What steps should I take if I've plateaued on a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting?

The primary objective is to manage insulin levels effectively while promoting a healthy metabolic state. To achieve this, consider the following strategies:

1. **Avoid Snacking**: Eliminate snacks throughout the day to maintain stable insulin levels.
2. **Adopt a Two-Meal Structure**: Limit your meals to twice a day, ensuring they are sufficiently high in healthy fats. This will help sustain satiety between meals and support metabolic function.

Implementing these changes may help you overcome the plateau and enhance your overall progress on a ketogenic diet combined with intermittent fasting.

## What strategies can I employ to help my children reduce their sugar intake?

Added sugars are everywhere, even in places you might not expect them. The average child consumes 66 pounds of added sugar every single year!

**Here are some sugary foods to avoid:**

• Sweetened milk

• Sweetened chocolate milk

• Sweetened tea

• Fruit juices

• Sodas

• Sports drinks

• Vitamin drinks

• Ketchup

• Sauces

• Breaded meats

• Chicken fingers

The best thing you can do for your kid’s health is to get them off of junk food! By removing sugar from the diet, you can get them to start burning fat instead of sugar.

**There are several benefits to burning fat instead of sugar:**

• Improved mood

• Improved cognitive function

• Improved ability to learn

• Stabilized blood sugars

The best way to get your kids to stop eating sugar is to substitute sugary foods with identical alternatives. Keto-friendly cookies, pies, and chocolates are all great alternative foods for kids, without the sugar. Keto bombs are also a great alternative to junk foods and other sugary foods. Keto bombs are similar to a cookie, but made completely of fat. You can use erythritol, xylitol, and stevia to sweeten treats instead of sugar. It may take a few days for your child to adjust, but removing sugar from your kid’s diet is a great choice for their health.

## What strategies can I implement to avoid weight gain after completing a ketogenic diet?

It is advisable to maintain carbohydrate intake at 50 grams or more per day, with protein consumption limited to a maximum of 8 ounces. For those practicing intermittent fasting, consuming two meals per day is recommended.

If there are no compelling reasons to discontinue the ketogenic diet, it may be beneficial to continue with it to reap its potential advantages.

## What supplements does Dr. Berg recommend taking while on the healthy Ketogenic Diet?

Dr. Berg recommends several supplements to take while on the ketogenic diet for optimal health and functionality. Here are some of them:

**1. Magnesium:** Many people, even those who are not on the ketogenic diet, struggle with magnesium deficiency due to poor dietary choices and even certain medications that can deplete the body’s supply of magnesium. Ideally, keto dieters should make sure they are getting at least 200–400 mg of magnesium each day.

**2. Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Omega-3s can reduce inflammation, improve brain health, and decrease a person’s risk of heart disease, making them a very valuable item to have in your high-fat diet, either eaten as food or as a supplement.

**3. Vitamin B5:** This vitamin is important for the conversion from sugar to fat burning; it helps in keto-adaptation and prevents ketogenic fatigue, flu, and rash.

**4. Vitamin A:** This vitamin improves insulin resistance.

**5. Vitamin D:** This vitamin also improves insulin resistance.

**6. Choline:** This nutrient helps a fatty liver.

**7. Minerals:** First up are the major minerals: potassium, magnesium, sodium, and calcium. These four are what are called electrolytes—electrically charged minerals that maintain fluid throughout your body. Trace minerals such as iron, manganese, and copper are also beneficial when you’re on a keto diet. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.

***

## What supplements should I take on keto?

Here is the list of the most important nutrients needed for keto, along with sources for them.

* Minerals
* Vitamin B1 (needed in conversion from sugar to fat burning)
* Vitamin B3 (to remove fat and cholesterol from the liver)
* Vitamin B5 (for the conversion from sugar to fat burning; helps in keto-adaptation and prevents ketogenic fatigue, flu and rash
* Vitamin A (improves insulin resistance)
* Vitamin D (improves insulin resistance)
* Choline (to help a fatty liver)

Virgin cod liver oil helps to provide vitamin D and A equally. Nutritional yeast provides the B vitamins.

Electrolyte powder helps provide the minerals.

***

## What type of exercise will burn fat?

Short-duration, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is effective for heart health and weight loss. Examples include spin biking, slamball, plyometrics, and sprinting. HIIT can boost VO2 max, growth hormone, and testosterone levels. The key is to alternate brief, intense exercise intervals with adequate recovery periods to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system. A recommended HIIT routine involves 20-second intense workouts followed by 2 to 4 minutes of rest, repeated for 3 to 7 sets. Incorporating HIIT into your routine for 20 to 40 minutes can yield fat-burning effects lasting up to 48 hours post-workout.

***

## What vegetables are the most keto-friendly?

Healthy vegetables that have less than 1 carb per cup:

* Beet greens
* Arugula
* Lettuce
* Bok choy
* Chard
* Endive
* Mustard greens
* Spinach
* Sprouts
* Romaine
* White cress

You’re allowed 20 to 50 grams of carbs per day on the Healthy Keto® eating plan. Sometimes when people do keto, they’re afraid to eat too many vegetables because of the carbs. But if you consume these low-carb veggies, the carbs would basically be insignificant. These vegetables won’t stop you from losing weight, and they provide benefits like fiber and nutrients.

Healthy vegetables that have less than 3 carbs per cup:

* Avocado
* Asparagus
* Celery
* Chili pepper
* Cucumber
* Eggplant
* Mushroom
* Pickles
* Radish
* Zucchini
* Cabbage

Tomatoes in moderate amounts are OK.

High-carb vegetables (not recommended):

* Artichoke
* Pumpkin
* Rutabaga
* Turnip
* Potato
* Corn
* Squash
* Peas

***

## What yogurt can I eat on keto?

One that’s recommended is a special type of yogurt called Trimona. A few reasons why Trimona is recommended:

* It’s grass-fed
* Its producers use milk from cows that generate A2 protein versus A1 (less allergies)
* It’s organic
* It’s whole fat
* It’s fermented for 30 hours
* It’s not strained
* There are no thickeners or additives
* It’s plain, so it has less sugar
* It’s non-GMO

A serving of Trimona contains:

* 10 g carbs
* 6 g sugar
* 8 g protein
* 8 g fat

Trimona also contains friendly bacteria, including lactobacillus bulgaricus. A few potential benefits of lactobacillus bulgaricus:

* Could help improve lactose intolerance
* Stimulates the immune system
* Supports the liver
* Could help decrease diarrhea
* Could help decrease inflammation in the gut
* Could help decrease constipation

***

## What's better to consume on Keto, berries or fruits?

Fruits are generally higher in sugar and lower in fiber than vegetables. However, berries offer a unique advantage: they have less sugar and a lower glycemic load. This means they're packed with fiber and phytonutrients that help manage blood sugar spikes.

Here's a quick comparison:

* **Blackberries (¾ cup):** 4g carbs (best choice!)
* **Raspberries (¾ cup):** Slightly higher in carbs
* **Strawberries (¾ cup):** Higher in carbs than blackberries and raspberries
* **Blueberries (¾ cup):** 12g carbs (still a decent option)

Compare this to other fruits:

* **Apple:** 25g carbs, 19g sugar
* **Peach:** 13g sugar, 12g carbs
* **Banana:** 27g carbs, 14g sugar
* **Grapes:** 16g carbs, 15g sugar

Clearly, berries are a much better choice for a ketogenic diet. Remember, the goal with keto is to keep carbs low while minimizing blood sugar spikes, also known as the glycemic index and glycemic load.

## What's the best cheese for Keto diet?

The main names you will see would be "Natural" which means nothing and "Organic" which means without pesticides but you want to see "Grass-Fed." To make it even better look for "100% Grass-Fed" but make sure you do not get low-fat cheese, do the whole milk cheese.

**With 100% Grass-Fed Cheese you will get:**

\- Fat-soluble vitamins A-D-E-K2

\- Omega 3 fatty acids

\- CLA/DHA/EPA/ALA

\- Available Calcium

\- B12

\- Protein

## What's the best nut for Keto?

Today we’re going to cover the best types of nuts to have on a healthy keto diet. To find out what the best keto nuts are, I took the total carbs and subtracted the fiber to get the net carbs. I also put the fat grams next to the net carbs, because ideally, on the keto diet, you want more fat and low net carbs.

**Best and worst nuts for keto (1 cup):**

• Pecans: Total carbs (14g) - Fiber (10g) = Net carbs (4g) Fat = (71)

• Brazil nuts: Total carbs (16g) - Fiber (10g) = Net carbs (6g) Fat = (88)

• Walnuts: Total carbs (11g) - Fiber (5g) = Net carbs (6g) Fat = (52)

• Macadamia nuts: Total carbs (19g) - Fiber (12g) = Net carbs (7g) Fat = (102)

• Almonds: Total carbs (20g) - Fiber (11g) = Net carbs (9g) Fat = (45)

• Pine nuts: Total carbs (18g) - Fiber (5g) = Net carbs 13g) Fat = (92)

• Almond butter: Total carbs (47g) - Fiber (26g) = Net carbs (21g) Fat = (139)

• Pistachio: Total carbs (38g) - Fiber (13g) = Net carbs (21g) Fat = (56)

• Peanut butter: Total carbs (50g) - Fiber (15g) = Net carbs (35g) Fat = (130)

• Cashews: Total carbs (39g) - Fiber (4g) = Net carbs (35g) Fat = (62)

## What’s the best way to eat eggs on keto?

Poached or over-easy eggs are the best eggs for keto because they retain the most nutrients.

***

## What's the difference between lazy and dirty keto?

**Lazy keto** - Lazy keto is when you do not count calories or ketones. You primarily focus on counting carbohydrates—and keeping them below 50 grams per day. Lazy keto also involves consuming a moderate amount of protein (roughly 3-8 oz per meal) and consuming high amounts of fat (without focusing on the quality of fat).

**Dirty keto** - Dirty keto completely ignores the quality of your nutrients. Those who do dirty keto often eat at fast-food restaurants and consume processed cheese and meats. Dirty keto may also include a lot of MSG, low-nutrient foods, non-organic ingredients, high amounts of omega-6 fatty acids, and trans fats. On dirty keto, you might consume a heavily-processed fast-food burger without the bun, which—although keto-friendly—contains a lot of unhealthy ingredients. Overall, the difference between lazy keto and dirty keto is that dirty keto doesn’t focus on the quality of food at all. Those on dirty keto may consume some very unhealthy foods.

## When should you consider lowering your dietary fat intake on a ketogenic diet?

A high-fat diet is only bad if you are also consuming a lot of carbs. Keep in mind that the keto diet is not primarily a high-fat diet—it’s a low-carb diet. A diet that is high in fat and high in carbs is not a keto diet. I’ve also found that low-carb and low-fat diets are hard on the liver (especially with lean protein), which causes a lot of digestive issues.

You may want to lower your fat temporarily if you have gallbladder issues or a bile deficiency. Bile is vital to fat digestion. Taking purified bile salts, choline, or lipase can help with fat digestion. Another reason why you may want to lower your fat is if you’ve been on keto and your weight has plateaued. In this case, you can lower your fat to 75 grams per day. This will allow your body to tap into your own fat reserves.

It's important to note that the fructose content can vary depending on the specific variety and ripeness of the fruit. The amounts listed are general numbers.

***

## Which one is better: fasting or keto?

Initially, when you compare fasting and keto, you can see that fasting has a more powerful impact on your health than just ketosis. However, it’s best to combine fasting and keto together to enhance the benefits of both. Doing one will actually help the other. Combining the two will make doing both keto and fasting easier. It will also help you reach your health and weight-loss goals much faster.

***

## Why am I experiencing a cold sensation on Keto, and what should I do?

A cold sensation may occur while following a ketogenic diet, particularly during intermittent fasting. This can result from a reduced frequency of meals, causing your body to adapt by decreasing its metabolic workload. As your thyroid adjusts to these changes, you might feel cooler.

To help mitigate this sensation, consider incorporating iodine into your diet, such as from high-quality sea kelp, particularly during periods of intermittent fasting. This can support thyroid function and overall metabolic balance.

***

## Why am I experiencing unintended weight loss on the ketogenic diet?

People often start keto for the weight loss benefits but want to continue for the health benefits, even after they’ve lost weight.

**If you find that you’re getting too skinny on keto, avoid unwanted weight loss with these 7 tips:**

1\. Try weight training to build muscle

2\. Add more fat to your diet

3\. Add MCT oil or butter to your coffee or teeccino(Bulletproof coffee)

4\. Try keto bombs!

5\. Add nuts and nut butters to your diet

6\. Increase carbs, but not above 50 grams per day

7\. Increase vegetable intake

You should only consume a moderate amount of protein, around 8 ounces per meal is sufficient. Two meals a day is ideal to prevent extra weight loss on keto.

***

## Why am I gaining weight on keto?

If you're not losing weight on keto, it might be due to frequent eating or hidden sugars, which keep insulin high and store fat. However, if you’re exercising, muscle gain can make you weigh more even as your waist gets slimmer, indicating keto is working.

To optimize keto:

\- Double-check your carb intake

\- Adjust your fasting pattern

\- Reduce vegetable intake if bloating

\- Limit fat to about 75g

\- Exercise regularly

\- Add 30 minutes to 1 hour of sleep

\- Include apple cider vinegar, potassium, vitamin B1, magnesium, and vitamin D

\- Reduce stress

\- Address underlying health issues

***

## Why am I itching a lot on keto?

Sudden skin itchiness after starting keto can be caused by bile salts that back up from the liver into the skin. This can happen because the person has something called cholestasis.

Cholestasis is a situation where the person has a decreased flow of bile, either because there is an obstruction in one of the ducts, or there is sludge (a higher level of cholesterol and low bile). Bile is a detergent, and it can be very toxic if it’s in the wrong place, for example on the skin. A person with cholestasis may also experience a full sensation underneath the right rib cage. This may have started because you introduced more fat into the diet, and you didn’t have enough bile to handle the fat because your body hadn’t adapted yet.

Remedies for itchiness on keto:

* Consume purified bile salts (TUDCA)
* Consume choline

***

## Why am I losing muscle on keto?

This could be due to low protein in your diet and a lack of exercise.

When you don’t want to lose muscle mass while doing intermittent fasting, add strength training as a part of your workout, loading up muscle to recruit as many muscle fibers as you can.

* Go heavy weight with a lower number of reps
*   Go moderate amount of weight to failure

    Or you can do a combination of both the above. These two actions can create a hypertrophic effect on the muscles which can keep them bigger and prevent them from shrinking when you are doing keto and intermittent fasting.

***

## Why am I so hungry on Keto?

Increased hunger may indicate that your body has not yet fully adapted to ketosis. It’s important to assess your carbohydrate intake, as it may be too high, which can hinder your ability to enter fat-burning mode. Additionally, incorporating intermittent fasting could be beneficial, as it helps facilitate the transition to ketosis.

During the initial adaptation phase, some hunger is normal; however, as your body becomes more efficient at burning fat for energy, you should experience a reduction in hunger. This decrease in appetite is a key indicator that the ketogenic diet is effectively working for you. If your hunger persists, consider consulting a healthcare professional for further guidance.

***

## Why am I so thirsty on keto?

You probably are not producing enough saliva. On keto specifically, you are not taking any starches (hopefully), and they make the body produce saliva. But another factor is electrolytes. To prevent thirst on keto: increase the amount of vegetables or take a good electrolyte powder and make sure to increase the amount of sea salt because it will help you establish a better hydration.

***

## Why am I tired on Keto?

Many of my patients ask me why they feel lethargic and fatigued when they go into ketosis. First, let’s talk about what ketosis is. On a ketogenic diet, you switch from using sugar as your primary fuel source to using fat. The purpose of fat is to protect the body from starving of sugar. So when you eliminate sugar, you naturally start burning fat. Most people don’t start burning fat reserves because they have a little too much sugar or carbs in their diet. You have to starve the body of sugar to really get into ketosis. To break down fat and turn it into fuel, your body now has to create new enzymes. This can take between three days and two weeks. There’s one nutrient that helps with this process. Without it, you are going to feel fatigued and lethargic. This nutrient is vitamin B5. This is a helper vitamin that boosts the metabolism of fat. Vitamin B5 also supports the adrenal glands, which helps with adrenal fatigue.

If you are tired on keto, grab some vitamin B5 from the health foods store and see how it affects your energy levels.

***

## Why are my feet shrinking on Keto?

This condition is called fluid retention. Glycogen is the storage of sugar in the body and when you are consuming a lot of carbohydrates, you are running your body out of the stored sugar. Each gram of glycogen is bonded to 2 grams of water. When you are doing a healthy ketogenic diet plan and intermittent fasting, it is very normal that you will dump a lot of the fluid.

• Glucose holds H2O

• Water follows glucose

• Glucose retains sodium

• Glucose rids excessive amounts of potassium

***

## Why aren't my blood sugar levels lowering with intermittent fasting and ketosis?

You likely have severe insulin resistance with high insulin and poor cell absorption, leading to high blood sugars. To lower your blood sugars, try the following:

**1. Reevaluate Your Diet:** Ensure you're consuming protein, carbs, and fats properly and eating enough vegetables. Consider reducing your carbohydrate intake—if you eat 50 grams a day, cut it to 20; if 20 grams, reduce to 10 grams.

**2. Reduce Meal Frequency:** Shorten your eating window by consuming fewer meals.

**3. Increase Nutrients:** Add B vitamins (from nutritional yeast), potassium (from electrolytes), zinc, and chromium to your diet.

**4. Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve insulin resistance.

**5. Address Health Issues:** Focus on the most significant health issues you have and work on improving them.

**6. Improve Sleep and Manage Stress:** If you have insomnia or high stress, take steps to address these.

**7. Be Patient:** It may take more time on keto and intermittent fasting to see improvements in your blood sugars.

## Why can stomach problems happen on keto?

Digestive issues on keto, like bloating and nausea, often stem from sugar alcohols and excessive fiber intake. Erythritol and xylitol can cause diarrhea, while too much fiber from veggies or keto products may overwhelm digestion. Opt for whole foods, avoiding synthetic sugars like dextrose and maltodextrin. Moderating MCT oil intake and gradually introducing new fats can help. Consider purified bile salts and betaine hydrochloride supplements. Apple cider vinegar aids digestion. Intermittent fasting can aid digestion by allowing breaks between meals. Limit nuts, peanut butter, almond flour, and cheese initially.

***

## Why do I feel nauseous on Keto?

This is usually a sign of liver or gallbladder problems. Try to consume purified bile salts and see if that helps.

Also, various kinds of sugar alcohol could cause digestive problems. Try to cut back on them and only use a small amount.

Adjust the vegetables you eat; maybe you need to switch to different ones due to sensitivity. You can consume fermented vegetables in this case as it may help.

Avoid dextrose and maltodextrin.

Sometimes people add too many fats on a ketogenic diet without getting used to the quantity gradually. This can cause nausea as well.

***

## Why do I get diarrhea on Keto?

Why do you get diarrhea on keto? There are a few reasons, which I’ll explain. First, you may not be used to digesting the amount of saturated fat required on keto. Your body will produce more bile, which lubricates your colon. Cut back on your oil consumption, especially if it’s in a liquid form like MCT oil. Also, reduce the amount of butter and coconut oil you’re consuming. See if that helps.

A more likely reason is that you’re not used to digesting the quantity of vegetables I recommend. Certain compounds in some vegetables can overwhelm the microbes in your small intestine. Switch the type of vegetables you’re consuming to safe ones: lettuce, cucumber, tomato, zucchini, bell pepper, and bean sprouts.

For now, avoid consuming onions, garlic, artichokes, beetroot, leeks, Brussel sprouts, and cabbage. As well, temporarily avoid green beans, avocados, blackberries, cauliflower, mushrooms, and fennel. Stick with the safe vegetables I listed, and try consuming fermented vegetables.

As your microbes start multiplying and adapting to the safe vegetables, you’ll be able to gradually include more of the ones you were temporarily avoiding. Ease more of them in after three or four weeks. You should no longer get diarrhea on keto.

***

## Why do I have a bad breath on Keto?

When the body releases ketones, you could have a higher amount of acetones being released from the body. This could smell like a nail varnish remover. In this case, consume more vegetables.

If you are consuming more protein, you would get a spike in ammonia, which could smell a bit like urine, you need to reduce your protein. If you have an odor that is like sulfur (eggs), then you need to take something called EM - effective microbes: [https://bit.ly/2Dx2b9l](https://bit.ly/2Dx2b9l) and [https://amzn.to/2CFiU8D](https://amzn.to/2CFiU8D)

***

## Why do I have a dry mouth on keto?

Adults produce 0.5 to 1.5 liters (2 to 6 cups) of saliva daily. On keto, without starches and sugars, the need for amylase and saliva decreases. Additionally, keto increases the need for electrolytes, especially potassium and magnesium.

Reducing carbs often leads to fewer vegetable intake, causing a mineral deficiency. Consuming 7 to 10 cups of salad daily provides the necessary potassium (4,700 mg). Healthy Keto® emphasizes vegetable intake to maintain electrolyte balance.

To prevent dry mouth on keto, increase vegetable consumption, use a good electrolyte powder, and add Himalayan sea salt for better hydration.

***

## Why do I have high blood glucose levels on Keto?

First, let’s quickly go over insulin resistance. **If a person is insulin resistant, they typically have very high insulin in their body—around 5 to 9x the normal amount.**

Insulin regulates blood sugars by lowering them and keeping them down. Over time, this mechanism weakens and your insulin levels drop. This leads to high blood sugar, prediabetes, and eventually diabetes.

**If you have high blood glucose on keto, you probably had high insulin before you started the keto diet. Once you begin a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, your body is no longer spiking insulin. Without high insulin, there is nothing keeping your blood sugars down.**

The good news is that high blood glucose on keto is temporary as your body transitions into ketosis. Your blood sugar will eventually stabilize.

***

## Why do I have increased cholesterol on a Ketogenic diet?

A fat cell is composed of triglycerides and cholesterol. You are losing weight, you are losing fat, and as you do that the fat cell breaks down. You can burn the triglycerides part of the fat for fuel, but not cholesterol. Cholesterol will be eliminated. So this spike in cholesterol is temporary and will go down.

If you are concerned about your cholesterol or LDL, you may want to request an advanced lipid panel which measures the particle size.

Continue to consume large amounts of veggies to help flush your liver and other organs while you’re on a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. Bile salts are also extremely helpful. Bile salts help to regulate excessive amounts of cholesterol so a lack of bile salts can keep your cholesterol high.

## Why do I have split nails on keto?

Potential causes of split nails:

* Low iron
* Low biotin
* Low calcium (most common cause)
* Low vitamin D
* Onychoschizia (due to trauma from polishes and solvents or detergents)

***

## Why do I still have acne on keto?

Normally, keto helps with acne by addressing underlying hormonal issues. Persistent acne may indicate high androgens, which increase skin oiliness. Androgens often rise due to high insulin levels, potentially from hidden sugars or artificial sweeteners. Implement intermittent fasting with your keto diet to help manage insulin levels.

Stress can also trigger cortisol release, spiking insulin and causing acne. Reduce stress by taking daily 45-minute walks, avoiding stress triggers, and consuming nutritional yeast.

To address acne, check food labels for hidden carbs or sugars, add healthy fats, consume purified bile salts, practice intermittent fasting, and eat 7 to 10 cups of vegetables daily. Additionally, consume probiotics or fermented vegetables. If stress is a problem, improve sleep, take naps, and continue with long outdoor walks.

***

## Why do I still have sweet cravings on Keto?

**Dr. Berg talks about ketosis and some people still crave sweets even when they start a ketogenic diet.**

1\. You may be in the transition phase and it's going to take more time.

2\. You may need more potassium (this stabilizes blood sugars)

3\. If you enjoy chocolate, consume sugar-free always.

4\. If you crave bread - it means you need more B vitamins (nutritional yeast)

5\. Liver - your liver may be damaged due to many things and this alone can block ketosis.

***

## Why do low blood sugars occur on Keto?

**When I look deeper at this problem there are 3 things I see often:**

1\. Not doing it correctly not enough vegetables, proteins, or even fat.

2\. Not doing it consistently. Instead, they are "sort of" doing it.

3\. They do not do it long enough for it to work. This can create lots of mood issues - irritability and moody. In other words, you have to do it correctly, long enough to fully keto adapt.

## Why do people have a resistance to Keto?

### **Understanding Resistance to Keto**

Exploring why some resist the ketogenic lifestyle—due to misconceptions, social influences, and ingrained habits—can help individuals overcome these barriers and unlock keto’s benefits.

**Perception of Health Without Problems**

Many people mistakenly believe they’re in perfect health, overlooking the need for dietary changes. This mindset can hinder acceptance of the keto diet. Even though keto offers health and weight loss benefits, convincing those who feel healthy can be challenging, especially when symptoms aren't apparent. Sharing success stories and research about keto’s preventive benefits can help change this perception.

**The Challenge of Invisible Health Issues**

Invisible health problems often go unnoticed until they become serious. Conditions like prediabetes or insulin resistance may not present obvious symptoms. By gently guiding friends and family to recognize these hidden risks, we can show how keto can combat inflammation and stabilize blood sugar.

**Identifying the Real Issue**

Understanding the core issue is crucial for finding effective solutions. Whether in relationships, work, or health, identifying underlying factors allows for targeted interventions and proactive steps.

**Beyond Weight Loss**

When discussing keto, it’s essential to look beyond just weight loss. Hesitations may arise from unseen struggles like chronic fatigue or medical conditions. By uncovering these issues, we can foster meaningful conversations about keto’s broader benefits, focusing on overall well-being and addressing concerns that may not be immediately visible.

## Why do triglycerides elevate on keto?

Your fat is a storage place for triglycerides. When you do keto and enter a state of ketosis, the triglycerides are mobilized, and they come out of the fat cell. They’re there to be used as energy. I believe fasting 12-14 hours before you get your triglycerides tested is very important. This way, the test isn’t affected by what you just ate or drank that may have temporarily caused your triglycerides to be higher. Consuming alcohol or carbs two days before the test can also cause your triglycerides to be temporarily high.

**A few potential causes of high triglycerides:**

• A hypothyroid condition

• A problem with the gallbladder

• The transitional phase of keto

• Hidden carbohydrates

• Hidden fats

## Why do we only need a moderate amount of protein on keto?

This is because 3 oz to 6 oz of protein per meal won’t spike your insulin levels. (This amount may vary depending on your fitness level, metabolism and ability to digest protein.)

You also want to consider your fasting schedule. If you are only eating one meal a day, you may want to add a little more protein to your meal.

Consume grass-fed, grass-finished beef, pasture-raised chicken (with the skin) and eggs as well as wild-caught salmon as good protein sources. Always go for the fattier proteins as that will contribute to lower insulin levels.

## Why isn't the ketogenic diet working for my hypoglycemia?

Someone was having an issue with keto where they said that keto didn’t work because even though they did keto and felt better after doing it for a month, they went back on their diet, and their hypoglycemia came back.

What causes hypoglycemia (low blood sugars) is something you ate that’s triggering insulin, and the insulin is pushing your blood sugars down. When you have hypoglycemia, you may think you need to consume sugar because your sugar is low. But, the problem with this is that you’re just going to activate insulin again, which will bring the blood sugar back down. I don’t believe you can correct hypoglycemia by consuming more carbs.

When someone starts the keto diet, they also really need to commit to it for longer than one month. If a person has hypoglycemia, they have very severe insulin resistance. It could take several years before this person could get into a stabilized position, and if the person was to go back to carbs, the situation would just come back. The keto and intermittent fasting plan is designed to be a lifestyle change.

## Why might Keto not be effective for me?

Healthy Keto® emphasizes a balanced macronutrient approach paired with nutrient-dense foods to optimize various health indicators, including energy levels, skin health, weight loss, cognitive function, inflammation, mood, cravings, and hunger management.

To implement keto effectively, consider the following guidelines:

\- **Avoid Fruits and Snacking**: Minimize intake of high-carb fruits and refrain from snacking between meals.

\- **Eat Only When Hungry**: Focus on true hunger cues rather than eating out of habit.

\- **Prioritize Healthy Fats and Greens**: Ensure that the majority of your diet consists of higher-fat foods and leafy greens.

\- **Incorporate Apple Cider Vinegar**: This can aid digestion and support metabolic health.

Aim for a protein intake of 3 to 6 ounces per meal, with fat comprising approximately 70% of your total caloric intake, and carbohydrates limited to 20 to 50 grams per day. For optimal results, consider combining the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting, which can further enhance metabolic flexibility and support weight loss goals.

## Why should I consume apple cider vinegar for weight loss on keto?

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is effective due to its acetic acid content. Acetic acid aids mineral absorption, mobilizes calcium, improves protein digestion, and boosts the immune system. ACV also helps improve blood sugar levels by increasing glucose sensitivity, leading to less insulin production and more fat burning.

Many people have overly alkaline blood pH. ACV, being acidic with a pH of 2.5, can slightly alter body pH, enhancing mineral transport, enzyme function, thyroid stimulation, and metabolism. It's also beneficial for stomach issues like heartburn, acid reflux, GERD, and indigestion, often caused by too alkaline conditions. As we age, our stomachs become more alkaline, so we need more acid.

## Will going low-carb and low-insulin reduce my muscle mass, and how can I maintain muscle while doing keto and intermittent fasting?

Maintaining muscle mass on a low-carb, low-insulin diet is possible if you follow these guidelines:

\- Keep your daily carb intake between 50-60 grams.

\- Consume 8-9 ounces of protein per meal.

\- Ensure you're not deficient in essential nutrients.

Insulin is an anabolic hormone that helps absorb amino acids, but consistently high insulin from carbs and sugar leads to insulin resistance, impairing amino acid absorption and causing muscle loss. Keto and intermittent fasting improve insulin sensitivity, enhancing amino acid and protein absorption.

For muscle maintenance and growth, incorporate weight training and increase protein intake. Aim for 8-9 ounces of high-quality protein per meal from sources like eggs, meat, and fish. Avoid high-carb foods to prevent insulin resistance.

Consider supplementing with complete amino acids for maximum efficiency in muscle building.

## Will vegetables slow down ketosis?

They will not, especially if you avoid things like corn, carrots and potatoes. If you eliminate those you don’t have to worry about the vegetable part of your diet slowing down ketosis.

Most ketogenic diets recommend 20 to 50 g of carbs per day without differentiating the types of carbohydrates. Dr Berg recommends that you get those carbs from your vegetable sources.

## Will wheatgrass powder kick me out of ketosis?

The answer is NO! Wheatgrass Juice Powder only has about one calorie. It's the calories that trigger the hormone responses in your stomach that will kick you out of ketosis.

## Would lemon water help me to lose weight on keto?

There are no studies that demonstrate that drinking lemon water will help you lose weight. But, there are still benefits to lemon water.

Here are 3 amazing lemon water / lemon juice benefits:

1\. Citric acid

Will bind with oxalates and help reduce the risk of kidney stones

2\. Vitamin C

Lemons can provide a good amount of vitamin C; but, it needs to come from raw lemons

3\. Alkaline

Lemons turn into an alkaline compound in the body that can help decrease the risk of gout. It can also potentially reduce the risk of getting uric acid stones.
