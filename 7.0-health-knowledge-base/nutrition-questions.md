## Alkaline Water: Natural vs. Artificial

**Natural vs. Artificial Alkaline Water**

**Natural Alkaline Water:**

\- **Source:** Sourced from springs or wells, rich in minerals like calcium and potassium.

\- **Benefits:** Helps replenish minerals, aids hydration, and may neutralize acidity from processed foods.

**Artificial Alkaline Water:**

\- **Process:** Uses machines to alter pH levels without adding essential minerals.

\- **Concerns:** Lacks beneficial nutrients and may cause metabolic imbalances if consumed excessively.

## Are 4 eggs a day too much?

Most healthy adults can consume 4 eggs per day with no problems at all. [How many eggs you consume](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-many-eggs-can-i-eat-per-day) depends on your size and daily caloric needs, but 4 eggs a day is not too many.

***

## Are avocados healthy?

Yes, avocados are exceptionally healthy. Their unique nutritional profile provides significant amounts of healthy fats and essential nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants, and cancer-fighting defensin. The many health benefits of avocados are hard to ignore. Consuming avocados regularly helps to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, supports optimal nutrient levels, and lowers the risk of microbial infections.

***

## Are avocados keto-friendly?

Yes, avocados are very keto-friendly. In fact, avocados contain the most fat of all fruits and vegetables, and their high-fat to low-carb ratio makes them a healthy ingredient for your keto recipes.

Check out this [keto food list](https://www.drberg.com/ketosis-approved-foods) to learn about other nutritious keto-friendly foods.

***

## Are avocados safe for everyone?

Avocados are generally safe and cause few adverse health effects. Some people appear sensitive to avocados and may experience diarrhea if they consume too many. This is likely caused by the insoluble fiber, and moderating avocado intake resolves this issue.

Although rare, some individuals with latex allergies can also experience allergic reactions when consuming avocados. Avocados contain similar proteins to the ones found in latex from rubber trees.

***

## Are beets a superfood?

Yes, beets are a bona fide superfood. They’re a rich source of vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, and antioxidants. Beets are one of the few food sources of betalains, a group of potent health-promoting phytochemicals.

Regularly consuming beets supports healthy blood pressure, lowers your risk of heart and liver disease, promotes healthy vision, and may protect you from the development of colon cancer.

***

## Are beets good to consume for the liver?

Beets have a lot of amazing properties. They can actually bind and hook up toxins and poisons and convert them to water-soluble particles. Beets can essentially help transform poisons into non-poisons.

Other benefits of beets:

• They support the eyes

• They support the blood pressure and arteries

• They help reduce fat from accumulating on the liver

• They help prevent DNA damage (decreasing the risk of cancer and shrinking tumors in certain places in the body)

• They are loaded with vitamin C, manganese, and copper

If you’re going to consume beets, I would recommend that you steam them for no longer than 15 minutes. They’re great to have on salads. Beets are higher are high on the glycemic index, but they have a low glycemic load because they’re high in fiber. This means that they won’t spike your blood sugars unless you juice them. You can steam them, cook them (but don’t overcook them), or have pickled beets.

***

## Are eggs high in zinc?

Yes, eggs are a good source of zinc. According to Dr. Berg, having eggs daily is an easy way to help meet your daily requirement for zinc and other essential minerals. Specifically, four eggs provide 2.6 mg of zinc. Regularly consuming various zinc-rich foods, including eggs, can help combat zinc deficiency.

***

## Are Electrolyte drinks good for you?

Yes, electrolyte-containing drinks are an excellent way to promote electrolyte balance, which is crucial for optimal hydration, energy production, muscle function, and maintaining the body’s pH balance. However, avoid sugary sports drinks that can cause weight gain and dehydration and opt for electrolyte-enriched water instead.

***

## Are energy drinks suitable if I want to get hydrated?

No, energy drinks aren’t good for hydration. Energy drinks are often high in caffeine and sugar, which stimulate increased urine production, cause fluid loss, and interfere with normal kidney function.

***

## Are expensive eggs worth it?

**Chicken Egg Sourcing: A Quick Overview**

**Space Requirements:**

\- **Caged Chickens:** Typically have around 67 square inches (about 8x8 inches) per bird.

\- **Cage-Free Chickens:** Confined to a barn with approximately one square foot of space per bird.

\- **Free-Range Chickens:** Given about 2 square feet of space, with potential outdoor access.

\- **Pasture-Raised Chickens:** Provided 10x10 feet of outdoor space.

**Health Implications:**

\- **Limited Space:** Increases stress hormones in chickens, negatively impacting egg quality.

\- **Conventional Feed:** Often includes GMO corn and soy, leading to high omega-6 fatty acids in eggs, which can contribute to inflammation and affect overall health.

**Best Choice:**

\- **Organic Pasture-Raised Eggs:** Although pricier, these eggs are a healthier option due to better living conditions and feed.

***

## Are Gatorade and Powerade Good for replenishing electrolytes?

Most commercial sports drinks, such as Gatorade or Powerade, are high in caffeine, don’t offer enough potassium to maintain balanced electrolyte levels, and can contain as much as 25 grams of added sugars per serving. Regularly consuming these sports drinks is associated with weight gain, tooth enamel corrosion, and dehydration.

***

## Are gluten-free products really gluten-free?

Gluten is the only protein that humans can not digest. Over the years, we’ve added more and more gluten to the diet, which has increased gut inflammation. Just because a food is gluten-free does not make it healthy! Processed gluten-free foods are loaded with seed oils, sugars, and starches. Gluten can destroy the gut, but so can refined starches and sugars. Good bacteria prefer fiber, but bad bacteria thrive on sugar and starches. Consuming processed gluten-free foods can create an overgrowth of harmful bacteria.

When bad bacteria breaks down and dies, it releases a toxic byproduct that can lead to inflammation in the liver, a fatty liver, and skin issues like dermatitis. Chemicals, enzymes, and acids are used to remove the gluten from the grain in processed gluten-free foods, creating a more highly refined product.

Gluten-free foods are low in protein, which can lead to over-eating. They can also cause SIBO, inflammation, and leaky gut. Gut health directly contributes to your mental health, so this can lead to moodiness, lowered emotions, anxiety, and depression. Read the ingredients in gluten-free products or focus on consuming whole foods like meat and vegetables. If the fiber from vegetables makes things worse, try the carnivore diet for some time.

***

## Are heart healthy whole grains safe to consume?

The American Association of Cereal Chemists defines whole grains as “any mixture of bran, endosperm, and germ in proportions one would expect to see in an intact grain”.

**There are 3 parts of an intact grain:**

• Bran- outer layer containing fiber, trace minerals, and B-vitamins

• Germ- B vitamins, vitamin E, trace minerals, phytonutrients, healthy fats

• Endosperm- All of the carbohydrates and a few B-vitamins

According to the FDA, all you need is 51% of these three elements to call a product whole grain. This means that the other 49% could be refined grains, sugars, sweeteners, or other additives.

Refined grains are made by removing the bran and the germ, leaving only the endosperm. There aren’t many vitamins in the endosperm, so the grains are typically enriched with synthetic vitamins and iron. Whether something is made from whole grains or refined grains, it’s still very high on the glycemic index and unfit for a ketogenic diet. The American Association of Cereal Chemists expanded their definition of whole grains to include grains that have been ground. When you grind whole grains, the grinding process exposes them to oxygen, which destroys vitamin E, part of the vitamin B complex, and many of the phytonutrients and healthy fats. Ground grains are more susceptible to going rancid when they’re exposed to air and other things like mold, so chemicals are added to the grains to preserve them.

***

## Are Rice Cakes anti-inflammatory?

Rice cakes do not possess significant anti-inflammatory properties. They may contribute to inflammation due to their high glycemic index, causing rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, which can trigger pro-inflammatory pathways.

***

## Are seed oils worse than sugar?

On average, we’re consuming way too many foods high in omega-6 fats. Ideally, a person should consume a 1:1 ratio of omega-3 fatty acids to omega-6 fatty acids. However, the average ratio is 15:1. This imbalance can lead to all kinds of health problems, especially in the cell membranes.

Refined sugar also leads to health issues and is converted to fat, but the extra sugar doesn’t accumulate in the body like omega-6 fatty acids do.

Omega-6 fatty acids (seed oils) lodge into your cells and accumulate in your tissues for 600 days. They are not water-soluble like sugar is and can't be burned off like sugar can.

Both refined oils and refined sugar can deplete important nutrients. While certain whole foods, like fruit, have sugar, they also have nutrients and phytonutrients to help replenish what was lost and provide protection. But seed oils are a highly refined, over-processed part of a seed that doesn’t have any protective factors.

To make seed oils they also use a solvent called hexane to extract the oil from the seed—is it possible some of this solvent could end up in the oil?

Overall, while sugar isn't good for you, omega-6 fatty acids are worse for your health than sugar is.

***

## Are sugars good for body strength?

If you put your body on contact with sugar, it gets picked up by receptors and the body gets weak. Dr. Berg tests the strength of the arm before and after contact with sugar, then compared with kale. Try it yourself to see if it works for you.

***

## Are there potential Hibiscus tea pregnancy risks?

Hibiscus increases blood flow to the uterus. This can stimulate menstruation during the early stages of pregnancy, which increases the risk of miscarriage. Hibiscus may also potentially trigger uterine contractions during the third trimester, increasing the risk of preterm labor.

***

## Can and should I use stevia in my diet?

For the most part, if you can get stevia by itself, it’s going to be okay. Ideally, get the stevia that’s green and not white; the white has a lot of unneeded chemicals. It’s very important to read the labels on the things you buy. Just because something might be “keto-friendly” doesn’t mean it’s healthy. That can be the case with stevia on keto. The problems with some brands of stevia sweetener:

• Stevia in the Raw – contains maltodextrin (the sweetener highest on the glycemic index)

• Sweet Leaf – contains inulin (can create bloating)

• Better Stevia – contains organic cane alcohol

• Pyure Stevia – organic stevia and natural flavors (likely to be GMO ingredients)

***

## Can diabetics consume potatoes?

A baked potato has a glycemic index of 84-111 (too high).

Boiled potato has a glycemic index of 82 (still too high)

Instant potato has a glycemic index of 97 (way too high).

If I were a diabetic, I would get my carbs below 20 grams per day.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/can-diabetics-eat-potatoes-drberg)

***

## Can high sugar intake cause dehydration in the body?

Yes, sugar has dehydrating effects.

Sugar changes the osmotic pressure within the digestive tract, which causes fluids to be drawn from the body into the intestines, contributing to water loss and dehydration.

***

## Can I add ranch dressing to my salad?

As long as It is not made from vegetable oils, like canola or soy, it should be okay to consume.

***

## Can I consume all the vegetable parts?

**Utilizing All Parts of Vegetables**

**Broccoli Leaves**

Often discarded, broccoli leaves are highly nutritious, containing more vitamin A, calcium, iron, and vitamin C than the florets. Rich in sulforaphane, they offer notable anti-cancer benefits. Incorporate them into your meals for enhanced nutrition.

**Outer Layers**

Vegetable outer layers, such as cabbage leaves, onion skins, and darker lettuce leaves, are nutrient-dense. They have higher concentrations of antioxidants, fiber, vitamins, and minerals due to increased sunlight exposure during growth. Consider using these parts to maximize nutritional benefits.

***

## Can I consume cheese every day?

**Cheese is a great protein source, has probiotic properties, and is low in lactose.**

**The best cheeses are goat cheese and sheep cheese. These cheeses contain A2 casein, which is easier on your digestive system than lactose. Surprisingly, the oldest people in the world consume sheep cheese and goat cheese!**

Cow's milk is around 4% lactose, while cottage cheese and mozzarella cheese vary from 1% to 4% lactose. Goat cheese and sheep cheese are only about .5% lactose. Goat and sheep cheese are higher in protein, vitamin A, vitamin E, folic acid, B vitamins, calcium, and CLA than cow's milk cheese. CLA helps with exercise performance and weight loss.

Around 20% to 30% of the fat in sheep and goat cheese is MCT fat, which is converted directly into ketones. Sheep cheese and goat cheese generate quick energy with little stress on your digestion.

**Cheese from animals who graze at higher altitudes is higher in polyphenols. When you introduce these polyphenols to your mitochondria, it triggers an uncoupling effect. This means it generates extra energy, which is effective if you’re trying to lose weight. Polyphenols also stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis.**

**Research has shown that people who live longest have more mitochondria uncoupling. Other ways to stimulate mitochondrial uncoupling include exercise, cold therapy, fasting, and consuming other polyphenols like sulforaphane, turmeric, and green tea.**

***

## Can I consume eggnog on keto?

Not really, due to high carb content. Unless you make it yourself with keto-friendly ingredients.

**How to make:** Keto-Friendly Egg Nog Ingredients: 2 cups heavy cream (grass-fed) 1 cup coconut milk 4 large eggs (pasture-raised) 3 Tbsp xylitol (or swerve) 1 tsp vanilla 2 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp allspice Instructions: Blend it up!

***

## Can I cook with seed oils or vegetable oil?

Vegetable oils do not come from vegetables. Vegetable seed oils are highly processed oils that are processed with high heat and chemical solvents. When heat is added to refined oils, toxic byproducts like trans fats are created. Seed oils are genetically modified, so they often contain traces of glyphosate. BHA is a toxic byproduct found in seed oils and is classified as a possible human carcinogen. Other toxic byproducts can affect the immune system, nervous system, and liver.

All chronic diseases involve inflammation. Vegetable oils are the most inflammatory thing that you can consume. They create damage at the cellular level and are often stored in the fat cells because they can’t be used for fuel. It takes a year and a half to detoxify seed oils from the membranes in our bodies.

Soy, corn, sunflower, canola, and cottonseed are the most common seed oils. Cottonseed oil is the worst seed oil as it produces the most toxicity and has the most omega-6 fatty acids. Cottonseed oil is highly inflammatory and is often hidden in animal feed. Any time you have inflammation, you also have a lack of oxygen. Cancer thrives in an area that’s inflamed or doesn’t have oxygen. Inflammation from seed oils can also contribute to insulin resistance.

Do not use vegetable oils at all! Replace seed oils with the following healthy cooking oils:

•Extra virgin olive oil

•Coconut oil

•Butter

•Ghee

•Red palm oil

•Tallow

•Lard

Mayo contains seed oils, so look for one without, like Chosen Mayo, which is made with avocado oil. It's best to avoid deep-fried foods. An air fryer can simulate fried foods, and crushed pork rinds rather than wheat products can be used as breading.

***

## Can I drink diet or zero-sugar soda?

It’s not recommended because it doesn’t have high nutritional value and it usually contains poor-quality artificial sweeteners.

For example, Diet Coke, Coke Zero and Coke Zero Sugar have the same ingredients except for their sweeteners. Both have aspartame which affects the gut, increasing the risk for insulin resistance and diabetes. It also has caramel coloring created in a process where they heat sugar with an ammonia compound to produce an end product called AGE or Advanced Glycation Endproducts, which create sticky proteins in the body.

***

## Can I drink matcha tea long term?

Yes. Matcha tea is a super-concentrated green tea beverage entirely made from ground green tea leaves.

Benefits of matcha tea:

* Will not make you feel jittery
* Makes you feel calm
* Gives you more energy
* Helps mental clarity
* Adds endurance
* 137 times the phytonutrients, compared to regularly brewed green tea
* Decreases inflammation

***

## Can I eat 4 eggs at once?

Absolutely. Four eggs for breakfast or lunch provide you with a healthy source of fat and protein.

***

## Can I eat beets every day?

Eating moderate amounts of beets daily is an excellent choice to support your health.

However, it's best to avoid eating too many beets if you are prone to kidney stones. Beets are high in oxalates and can increase the risk of kidney stone formation.

***

## Can I eat peanut butter?

Peanuts don't typically cause health issues, but they can cause bloating for some people, and it's still important to consume the right peanuts. Peanuts are not nuts—they are legumes that grow in the soil. **Conventional peanuts are heavily sprayed with pesticides and fungicides, which seep into the soil and penetrate their thin shells. This is why you should always choose organic peanuts and peanut butter. Glyphosate is also commonly found in peanuts. Glyphosate can act as an antibiotic and is found in many GMO foods.**

Always read the label on your peanut butter and ensure it doesn't contain hydrogenated oils. Hydrogenated vegetable oils don’t actually come from vegetables at all—they’re seed oils! Also, avoid peanut butter with added sugar. Monoglycerides are sometimes added to peanut butter. A French study linked this ingredient to cancer and found that it can increase the risk of certain cancers by 46%.

Look for peanut butter that only contains peanuts and salt. **Organic Valencia peanut butter that contains only Valencia peanuts and sea salt is the best option. Valencia peanuts contain the least amount of aflatoxins. Aflatoxins come from mold and can be very damaging to the liver. Try to have your peanuts with a meal rather than as a snack to avoid spiking insulin.**

***

## Can I eat what I crave?

If you’re on keto, you’re probably doing it for health reasons or weight loss. But if you’re not on keto, what motivates you to eat? **It’s dangerous to ask your body what it’s in the mood for because you’re really asking what’s going on with your blood sugars. If your blood sugars are low, your answer will likely be refined carbohydrates.**

Some people eat to try to raise their mood. Others eat just because there’s food there. It’s best not to have junk food available in your house because if it’s there, you might be more likely to start eating it without even thinking about it.

Our bodies have a mechanism to crave sodium foods. We do not have a mechanism to crave potassium foods. Our bodies retain salt, but they cannot really retain potassium. This gets people in trouble because they will ask their body what they’re in the mood for, and they will think they want something salty. They will start consuming a lot of sodium and not potassium, which will alter the correct ratio and can cause fluid retention and even more cravings.

**What to do:**

• When you eat, start with your vegetables first, and then have your salty protein.

• Find keto-friendly healthy foods that give you a lot of pleasure.

***

## Can I get zinc carnosine from foods that I eat?

No, the zinc l-carnosine complex isn’t naturally found in foods. It’s manufactured in pharmaceutical laboratories by chelating zinc with the amino acid l-carnosine.

***

## Can I give butter to my kids?

It would be a great idea to raise a child on cod liver oil and high-quality grass-fed butter to help support the child’s teeth, heart and bones. Grass-fed butter is a great source of vitamin K2. You can also get vitamin K2 from grass-fed meat and cheese, egg yolks, and fermented vegetables.

Why vitamin K2 is important for infants and children:

* It plays a crucial role in the development of facial bones
* It can help prevent cavities and premature calcification of cartilage end plates
* It protects the heart
* It helps support the structure of the teeth

A mother who breastfeeds gives her child a lot of vitamin K2, while children who are not breastfed are more likely to have a vitamin K2 deficiency. Lactic acid bacteria in the gut can also convert vitamin K1 to K2.

Vitamin K2 activates the function of other fat-soluble vitamins (like vitamin A and vitamin D), which are important for the development of a healthy immune system in a child. Cod liver oil has a great balance of vitamin D and vitamin A.

***

## Can I mix methylene blue with spring water?

Yes, you can mix methylene blue with spring water. Adding electrolytes can improve the taste. Methylene blue may enhance cellular energy and oxygenation by mitigating oxidative stress and capturing excess electrons.

***

## Can I only consume soda without water?

Most soda products contain sugar and caffeine, which trigger fluid loss, and drinking only soda and no water can lead to dehydration.

In addition, consuming too much soda can cause kidney issues, weight gain, metabolic imbalances, cardiovascular problems, and poor dental health.

***

## Can I rely on nutritional facts alone to determine whether the food is healthy?

Let’s compare the nutrition facts of Product A and Product B to see which food is healthier. Product A contains 29 grams of total fat, 4 grams of saturated fat, 17 grams of carbohydrates, and 1 gram of sugar.

Product B contains 8 grams of total fat, 1 gram of saturated fat, 16 grams of carbohydrates, and 0 grams of sugar. Based on these nutrition facts, which food is healthier?

Product A is an avocado, and Product B is Doritos! Doritos contain corn, vegetable oil, maltodextrin, monosodium glutamate, dextrose, and many other poor ingredients—yet you may have thought Product B was the healthier food. You can't rely on nutritional facts alone to determine whether a food is healthy; you must look at the ingredients.

Food is “that which is eaten to sustain life, provide energy, and promote the growth and repair of tissues.” Ultra-processed foods do not align with this definition! I believe that of everything that causes disease and destroys your health, ultra-processed foods are the most significant factor.

***

## Can I snack at night?

Snacking at night raises insulin thus prevents losing weight. Having higher insulin will prevent losing your belly. Make sure you do not have these snacks available in your space. In your last meal, to prevent snacking, add more fat to your meal.

## Can I use Acacia Powder instead of inulin powder for L. Reuteri Yogurt?

We have not tried the acacia powder as a replacement for inulin powder for the L. reuteri superfood yogurt, and we cannot verify it will work. Dr. Davis suggests raw potato starch in his recipe blog post - [https://drdavisinfinitehealth.com/2019/07/how-to-make-l-reuteri-yogurt-step-by-step/](https://drdavisinfinitehealth.com/2019/07/how-to-make-l-reuteri-yogurt-step-by-step/)

***

## Can I use chick peas to make Natto?

Yes, you can use chickpeas (garbanzos) to make natto! While traditionally made with soybeans, natto can be made with other beans, including chickpeas.

Here's why it works:

**Fermentation Process:** Natto relies on the bacteria _Bacillus subtilis_ to ferment the beans. This bacteria isn't exclusive to soybeans and can ferment other legumes like chickpeas

**Similar Nutritional Profile:** Chickpeas offer a comparable nutritional profile to soybeans, providing a good source of protein and fiber.

However, there are a few things to keep in mind:

**Texture:** Chickpea natto might have a slightly different texture than traditional soybean natto. It may be a bit firmer and less sticky.

**Taste:** The flavor might also be subtly different, with a slightly nuttier taste from the chickpeas.

***

## Can I use white vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar to drink with water?

Which is better? It relates to the source. Organic apples are much better than the sources of white vinegar. Apple cider vinegar also has additional benefits that white vinegar doesn’t have. The effects of distilled white vinegar and apple cider vinegar are going to be very similar. However, because the sources of white vinegar are low-quality, apple cider vinegar is a better choice.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/apple-cider-vinegar-vs-white-vinegar-the-big-difference)

***

## Can IU (International Units) be converted to mcg?

Yes. However, there is no universal IU-to-mcg conversion because IU measures biological activity or potency while mcg measures weight. However, conversion rates have been established for specific substances. For vitamin D3, the established conversion is:

• 1 IU of vitamin D3 = 0.025 mcg

• 1000 IU of vitamin D3 = 25 mcg

More information on the established conversion rate for vitamin D3 can be found in the FDA's "Converting Units of Measure for Folate, Niacin, and Vitamins A, D, and E on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels: Guidance for Industry" - [**https://www.fda.gov/media/129863/download**](https://www.fda.gov/media/129863/download)

***

## Can kids consume cereal?

Cereal for kids isn’t recommended.

The worst time to feed someone cereal is when they’re an infant. Infant rice cereal is very popular. It contains inorganic arsenic. Infants also don’t have the enzymes to digest the cereal.

In the soils where grains and plants are grown, there is always going to be some arsenic in very small amounts. This is called organic arsenic. Our bodies can actually deal with this very easily. But, inorganic arsenic is different and is not healthy.

There is even an interesting study that talks about the exposure of infants to cereal increasing the risk of autoimmune diseases.

The other big problem is the amount of sugar in cereals. This sugar could set the child up for blood sugar issues down the road. With some cereals, 1 cup contains the amount of sugar that’s in a Twinkie.

The whole grains in cereal contain phytate. Phytate is a chemical in grains that will block the absorption of zinc and other important minerals.

Additionally, some kids have an allergy to gluten, which is in many kinds of cereal.

GMO grains have also been exposed to glyphosate, which can create problems with the immune system.

This is all in addition to the fact that fortification of cereal with synthetic vitamins can also cause problems.

***

## Can my kids eat butter?

Grass-fed butter is a great source of vitamin K2. You can also get vitamin K2 from grass-fed meat and cheese, egg yolks, and fermented vegetables.

**Why vitamin K2 is important for infants and children:**

1\. It plays a crucial role in the development of facial bones

2\. It can help prevent cavities and premature calcification of cartilage end plates

3\. It protects the heart

4\. It helps support the structure of the teeth

**A mother who breastfeeds gives her child a lot of vitamin K2, while children who are not breastfed are more likely to have a vitamin K2 deficiency. Lactic acid bacteria in the gut can also convert vitamin K1 to K2.**

Vitamin K2 activates the function of other fat-soluble vitamins (like vitamin A and vitamin D), which are important for the development of a healthy immune system in a child. Cod liver oil has a great balance of vitamin D and vitamin A

***

## Can people on warfarin eat green vegetables?

Some green vegetables should be limited due to their high concentration of vitamin K, which plays a crucial role in blood clotting processes. Warfarin works by inhibiting this process; therefore, consuming large amounts of these foods could counteract the drug's intended effects leading to potential complications.

***

## Can pregnant women drink kombucha?

Yes, but unfortunately kombucha comes with a lot of carbs sometimes, and you don't want to drink too much, because it's very acidic. A little bit would be fine. It helps your digestion but be careful because it's a bit higher in sugar than you might think.

***

## Can you get a significant collagen amount from beef and eggs?

Many people mistakenly believe they get enough collagen from eating steak, meat, or eggs. The truth is, while collagen is a major protein in the body (about 30% of total protein), dietary sources are limited to things like bone broth, animal skins, pork rinds, and gelatin. Muscle meat alone doesn't provide it.

Collagen is essential for connective tissues – tendons, ligaments, muscles, and fascia – and contributes to skin structure (reducing sagging/wrinkles) and bone elasticity. It's key for healing and particularly important as we age.

Recognizing the difficulty in getting sufficient collagen from diet alone, we offer a collagen product called Multi Collagen Peptide. It features multiple types of collagen along with vital cofactors like natural Vitamin C, formulated to provide comprehensive support for your body's collagen needs.

***

## Can you use other bacteria strains to make yogurt?

While Dr. Berg hasn't experimented with other friendly bacteria cultures to make yogurt, Dr. William Davis is a great resource on this topic. He's done extensive research on L. reuteri yogurt and may have recommendations for other strains.

***

## Dairy and Plant-Based Proteins

[Dairy and plant-based proteins](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-ketogenic-diet-and-the-dairy) can be healthy choices, but it's important to know what to look for to make the best decisions for your health.

#### **The Debate Over Milk**

Most commercially available milk undergoes high-temperature processing that kills harmful bacteria, ensuring it's safe to drink.

This technique not only safeguards the milk by annihilating dangerous bacteria but also prolongs its usability, offering added convenience to shoppers.

***

## Do Apple Cider Vinegar and Cranberry juice together do any good for the body??

Drinking apple cider vinegar and cranberry juice promotes balanced blood sugar levels, which is crucial to boost fat burning and helps minimize the adverse effects of elevated insulin, including weight gain and insulin resistance.

***

## Do frozen vegetables have the same nutritional content as fresh vegetables?

Slightly lower but there's still a good amount of nutrition in frozen vegetables. So it's definitely better than heating the vegetables too much. When you do freeze drying you retain. And then you take out the water and they do it under low pressures. You preserve almost everything the enzymes, the vitamins, other proteins, and even the microbes that are in that vegetable.

***

## Do I need to stop eating fruit?

You don't need to eliminate fruit entirely on a keto diet. Berries are a suitable option as they are lower in sugar compared to other fruits.

Some individuals, particularly those following a carnivore keto approach, incorporate fruit and honey due to their improved metabolic flexibility and lack of insulin resistance. However, this is not suitable for everyone. Many people may struggle to metabolize higher-sugar fruits, leading to potential complications.

For most individuals, it is advisable to limit fruit intake to maintain ketosis and avoid metabolic issues, unless they are highly active and can effectively burn off the extra sugars.

***

## Do I need Vitamin B1 if I'm on a high carbohydrate diet?

Many individuals consume diets high in carbohydrates, which can deplete levels of Vitamin B1 (Thiamine). Vitamin B1 is essential for properly metabolizing carbohydrates, allowing the body to convert them into usable energy. When B1 is deficient, this metabolic pathway is impaired, hindering the body's ability to effectively process carbohydrates. This can lead to an accumulation of substances like lactic acid in the muscles. Consequences associated with this impaired metabolism and B1 deficiency can include symptoms such as restless leg syndrome, increased acidity, fatigue, and a higher risk of developing conditions like diabetes.

***

## Do meat products contain estrogen?

### **Understanding Estrogen in Meat Products**

When it comes to estrogen in meat products, there's a lot of confusion and misinformation out there. Let's dive into the specifics of estrogen levels found in beef and other meats to clarify some common misconceptions about their impact on human health.

It's important to understand that all animal products contain some level of naturally occurring hormones, including estrogen. However, the amounts found in meat are generally quite low compared to what our own bodies produce.

#### **Estrogen Levels in Beef vs. Human Production**

To put things into perspective, let's compare the natural estrogen production in humans with the amount found in beef. A young boy produces about 100 micrograms of estrogen daily, while one kilogram of beef contains less than 0.02 micrograms of estrogen.

That means a young boy's daily estrogen production is equivalent to the amount found in over 5,000 kg of beef. So, the idea that consuming meat will significantly increase your estrogen levels is simply not supported by the facts.

#### **The Feasibility of Estrogen Intake from Meat**

Given the low levels of estrogen in beef, it's practically impossible to consume enough to significantly affect your body's estrogen levels. You'd have to eat an unrealistic amount of meat daily to even come close to impacting your hormonal balance.

Current research findings support this conclusion. Studies have shown that the estrogen content in beef is so minimal that it's unlikely to have any measurable effect on human health, even with regular consumption.

So, while it's true that meat products contain some estrogen, the amounts are negligible compared to what our bodies naturally produce.

Focusing on a proper diet and healthy lifestyle choices is far more important for maintaining optimal hormone levels than worrying about the trace amounts of estrogen in your steak.

## Do my healthy beverages contain sugar?

### **Sugar Content in Common Beverages**

**Sports Drinks**

Popular for electrolyte replenishment, sports drinks like Gatorade contain about 21 grams of sugar per 20-ounce bottle—equivalent to over 5 teaspoons. For most, water and a balanced snack suffice.

**Flavored Coffee**

Flavored coffees, such as a 16-ounce Starbucks vanilla latte, can contain up to 25 grams of sugar, or over 6 teaspoons. Opt for plain coffee with a splash of milk or sugar-free syrups to reduce sugar intake.

**Iced Tea**

Commercially available iced teas can have up to 33 grams of sugar per 16-ounce bottle, exceeding 8 teaspoons. Homemade iced tea with unsweetened tea bags and a touch of honey or lemon is a healthier alternative.

## Do soda beverages cause dehydration?

Yes, soda can dehydrate you. Soda is typically high in sugar and caffeine, which have diuretic properties and negatively impact the body’s ability to regulate fluid balance.

***

## Do zero sugar foods really have no sugar?

Despite recent denials by doctors and organizations like the Sugar Association, there is growing evidence that excessive sugar consumption poses serious health risks, particularly for the cardiovascular system. This mirrors the tactics used by tobacco companies in the past to downplay the dangers of cigarettes.

The average person consumes 23 teaspoons of sugar daily, but this number doesn't account for hidden sugars lurking in many processed foods. Even products claiming to be sugar-free often contain starches, which can spike blood sugar even higher than sugar itself.

Highly processed starches like maltodextrin and modified food starch are not the same as natural starches found in potatoes or rice. They can wreak havoc on blood sugar levels and overall health. When these hidden starches are factored in, the average daily sugar consumption skyrockets to 75 teaspoons!

High-sugar diets deplete nutrient stores and cause oxidative damage, leading to chronic conditions like diabetes, Alzheimer's, inflammation, and skin problems. While processed foods are often fortified with synthetic vitamins, they are no substitute for whole, nutrient-dense foods.

Eliminating sugar and starch from your diet can break this cycle of disease, reverse fatty liver, lower blood sugar, and even promote ketosis, a state where your body burns fat for fuel instead of glucose. Ketones are a superior energy source for the heart compared to glucose.

## Does eating fat lower cholesterol?

Your body makes 3000 milligrams of cholesterol each day. That’s the equivalent of 14 eggs or a pound of butter every single day. If you lower your dietary cholesterol, your body will make more to compensate.

**High-fat diets are often associated with high cholesterol, but fat isn’t the problem! Low-fat diets are also high in carbohydrates, which spike insulin and raise cholesterol. A high-fat diet like keto is an ideal diet for a healthy cholesterol level.**

On keto, it is still important to avoid unhealthy fats like trans fats, hydrogenated oils, soy oils, and deep-fried foods. Instead, opt for healthier fatty foods.

**Here are a few examples:**

•Avocado

•Nuts

•Grass-fed meat

•Grass-fed dairy

•Grass-fed butter

•Wild-caught fish

•Cod liver oil

These healthy fats are not harmful to your cholesterol or your heart. A low-carb, high-fat diet can prevent insulin spikes and help lower cholesterol. The majority of the population will experience lowered cholesterol by following a low-carb diet. As fat cells release stored fat, you may notice a temporary increase in blood cholesterol levels when you begin a ketogenic diet, but remember this is only temporary. Try keto for one month and check your cholesterol levels!

***

## Does my lifestyle affect nutrient absorption in the body?

Nutrient absorption is a complex process influenced by diet, medications, supplements, and gut microbiota. Optimizing digestive health is crucial for ensuring your body effectively absorbs the nutrients necessary for well-being.

**Antibiotics and Gut Health:**

While antibiotics are essential for treating bacterial infections, they can disrupt gut microbiota, impairing nutrient absorption. This disruption may lead to digestive issues and nutrient deficiencies. To mitigate this, consider taking a high-quality probiotic supplement during and after antibiotic treatment to restore gut flora balance.

**Efficacy of Vitamin Supplements:**

Vitamin supplements can help address nutritional gaps but may not be as effective as nutrients from whole foods. The synergistic interactions of vitamins, minerals, and other compounds in food enhance their absorption and utilization. If supplements are needed, opt for high-quality, whole food-based options rather than synthetic versions for better absorption.

**Mineral Absorption:**

Mineral supplements are available in elemental and plant-based forms. Elemental minerals, isolated from natural sources, may not be as well absorbed. In contrast, plant-based minerals are naturally chelated to amino acids, enhancing their bioavailability. When choosing mineral supplements, prioritize plant-based options for optimal absorption.

## Does powdered milk contain hormones?

Absolutely. Sometimes people try to find a powdered milk for a formula. If you do that I would go for goat's milk and try to get it organic. Because with the cow's milk is there's so many allergies.There's so many issues with that hormonally. even if it says no BST which is another hormone thing. If you're going to do it I would go for the goat's milk powder.

## Does the color of the egg shell determine its nutritional value?

The color of an egg's shell does not affect its nutritional value. Brown eggs are more expensive primarily due to the larger breeds of hens that lay them, which require more feed. This increases production costs. In essence, the price difference is about the chicken, not the egg's health benefits.

## Has canola oil been banned in Europe?

**Concerns Over Canola Oil in the European Union**

**Erucic Acid in Canola Oil:**

\- **Health Risks:** Erucic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid found in rapeseed oil (from which canola oil is derived), is linked to serious health concerns. High consumption may cause cardiac lipidosis, a condition where fat accumulates on the heart muscle, impairing cardiac function. It is also associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes.

\- **EU Scrutiny:** Due to these risks, some European nations consider canola oil potentially hazardous. To mitigate these concerns, genetically modified canola plants have been developed to lower erucic acid levels.

**Healthier Alternatives:**

\- **Olive and Coconut Oils:** These oils offer nutritional benefits and are often considered healthier alternatives to traditional cooking oils like rapeseed or sunflower oil.

## Has the consumption of high-fructose syrup in the US increased?

High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) consumption has skyrocketed since the 1970s, outpacing the increase of any other food ingredient. This potent sweetener negatively impacts your health, contributing to metabolic problems, fatty liver disease, and inflammation.

HFCS lurks in many foods and drinks. It's often made from GMO corn, adding to health concerns. While other food trends have shifted, HFCS use continues its relentless rise.

The U.S., the world's top corn producer, has seen dramatic increases in corn yield per acre due to GMOs and chemicals. This has significant consequences for our environment and the food we eat.

Stay vigilant! Avoid HFCS and its aliases: modified food starch, modified corn starch, maltodextrin, glucose syrup, and seed oils.

***

## How breakfast affects your day?

What you eat for breakfast affects your ability to focus, your creative ability to solve problems, and how well you sleep at night. A carb-heavy breakfast promotes insulin resistance, which inhibits your ability to absorb fuel. The first place you’ll notice this is in your brain.

Ketones are a much better fuel for your brain than sugar. To make ketones, you need to lower your carbs and sugar. You can also produce ketones by fasting. While fasting, your body must convert to making ketones for energy. Carbohydrate breakfast foods leave you hungry within an hour-and-a-half of eating. Sugary cereal is a poor choice for breakfast. Magic Spoon or keto-friendly granola without added sugar is a better option.

Oatmeal is generally one of the most ultra-processed foods. If you want to eat oatmeal for breakfast, look for regular oatmeal without sugar. The best option for oatmeal is steel-cut oats, although they take longer to cook. Oatmeal and wheat are heavily sprayed with glyphosate, which has been shown to cause cancer and problems with your gut. Choose organic to avoid this problem.

Replacing your breakfast food with protein such as meat, bacon, and eggs can significantly change your energy levels and cognitive function. Eggs and bacon are the perfect healthy morning breakfast. You can also add avocado or cheese. Cheese is very nutritious, a good source of protein, and has good bacteria due to the fermentation process. Yogurt is a great breakfast option. Choose organic Greek or Bulgarian yogurt without added sugar, or make your own yogurt. Instead of giving your kids Wonder bread, try a sprouted bread like Ezekiel bread. Add peanut butter for extra protein. Red meat and pork sausage are also great breakfast foods.

It’s important to prioritize sleep! Losing just one hour of sleep can significantly affect your blood sugar and cognitive state.

## How can I get all the needed nutrients in one meal?

When it comes to protein, grass-fed beef, lamb, and goat are the best sources. People often think carrots are high in vitamin A, but they don't contain the active form. Retinol, the active form of vitamin A, is found in liver, fish, cod liver oil, and egg yolk. There are two types of iron: non-heme iron, found in plants, which is not very absorbable, and heme iron, found in liver and red meat.

Red meat, fish, eggs, cheese, and liver are all excellent sources of B vitamins. You can get B vitamins from grains, but grains contain phytic acid, which blocks the absorption of trace minerals.

Nutritional yeast and sunflower seeds are also good sources of B vitamins.

Collagen is a protein that makes up ⅓ of the body's protein. Consuming the skin from meat and fish, bone broth, and organ meats can help supply the body with collagen.

Cod liver oil, sardines, and fatty fish help provide vitamin D3, but the sun is the best source. Supplements can be helpful if you can't get enough sunshine. Shellfish, cod, dairy, eggs, sea kelp, and sea salt are the best sources of iodine.

Shellfish, organ meat, red meat, and Brazil nuts are the best sources of selenium. Oysters, beef, organ meats, and pumpkin seeds are the best sources of zinc.

Fatty fish is the best source of omega-3 fatty acids. You can get ALA from algae, the precursor to omega-3 fatty acids. Fish and dairy contain magnesium, but not very much.

Pumpkin seeds, greens, and chocolate are the best food sources.

Animal foods are also not the best source of potassium. Consume plenty of greens and avocado to help get potassium.

Check out these meal ideas that include foods high in nutrients:

•Steak, eggs, salad

•Burger, cheese, sauerkraut

•Liver, onions, cauliflower

•Egg, avocado

•Sardines, tomato

•Tuna salad with nutritional yeast

•Salmon, carrots, Brussels sprouts

•Shellfish, mashed cauliflower

•Short ribs, cheese, tomato

## How can I get enough potassium on a carnivore diet?

Potassium is important for the sodium-potassium pump present in all of your cells, which allows the contraction and relaxation of your nerves. Too much potassium is known as hyperkalemia, and too little is known as hypokalemia. Symptoms of high potassium include diarrhea, muscle pain, and muscle numbness. Symptoms of low potassium include constipation, muscle cramps, and fatigue. Potassium is vital for exercise performance. If you don’t have enough, you’ll probably feel weak or tired. One of the causes of low potassium is low magnesium.

Kidney disease can cause high potassium. If the kidney is not functioning properly, it won’t be able to get rid of potassium. It’s very rare to develop too much potassium in the blood from dietary intake.

Blood pressure medications or side effects of an adrenal condition known as Addison's can also cause high potassium.

Diuretics and steroids can cause low potassium. Surgeries and injuries can also cause low potassium.

Here are some of the best sources of potassium on the carnivore diet:

•1 cup of bone broth 500 mg

•3 ½ oz beef 350 mg

•3 ½ oz octopus 650 mg

•3 oz salmon 300 mg

•1 large egg 63 mg

•3 oz beef liver 125 mg

•3 oz chicken 300 mg

## How can I introduce celery juice into my diet?

**Incorporating Celery Juice into Your Diet**

**Selecting Fresh Celery:** Opt for fresh, organic celery to ensure high-quality juice free from pesticides and chemicals.

**Juicing Tips:** Use a high-quality juicer designed for fibrous vegetables. Drink the juice immediately to maximize nutrient retention. If storing, use an airtight container and refrigerate for no more than 24 hours.

**Optimal Timing:** For best results, consume celery juice first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. If needed, dilute with water or add a squeeze of lemon for flavor. Allow 15-30 minutes before eating other foods.

Incorporating these practices will help you reap the full benefits of celery juice, including enhanced hydration and nutrient intake.

***

## How can I introduce salad back in my diet after I had a pause in consuming salads?

If you experience fatigue after eating salads, don’t give up on them just yet. Salads are a nutrient-dense addition to a balanced diet, and with a few adjustments, you can enjoy their benefits without discomfort.

**Tips for Increasing Salad Intake:**

\- **Start small:** Gradually incorporate smaller portions of salad into your meals to allow your digestive system to adjust to the increased fiber.

\- **Increase gradually:** As your body adapts, slowly increase portion sizes to build tolerance over time.

\- **Diversify ingredients:** Vary the vegetables and toppings to ensure a wide range of nutrients and avoid overloading on a single type of fiber.

\- **Pair with protein:** Include a source of lean protein, like grilled chicken, tofu, or legumes, to balance the fiber and promote sustained energy.

By easing into a higher intake of salads and being mindful of your choices, you can enjoy their health benefits without experiencing post-meal tiredness.

## How can I mitigate morning hunger?

**Mitigating Morning Hunger**

To effectively manage morning hunger, especially on specific diets, consider these strategies:

1\. **Increase Fat Intake**: Adding healthy fats, such as avocados and nuts, can stabilize blood sugar levels and reduce hunger, providing sustained energy.

2\. **Incorporate Apple Cider Vinegar**: A splash before meals may help stabilize glucose levels and curb cravings, aiding in better appetite control.

3\. **Add More Vegetables**: Vegetables are high in fiber and nutrients while low in calories, helping to satisfy hunger without disrupting dietary goals.

***

## How can I optimize my diet for better magnesium intake?

To ensure adequate magnesium intake, it's best to focus on a diet rich in magnesium-dense whole foods. While supplements can be beneficial, dietary changes should be the first approach.

**Top Dietary Sources of Magnesium:**

Excellent sources include leafy greens like Swiss chard and kale, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains. Avocados, dark chocolate, and fatty fish such as salmon and mackerel also provide substantial magnesium.

When selecting grains, opt for minimally processed varieties like quinoa, buckwheat, and oats, which offer higher magnesium levels than refined grains.

**Improving Magnesium Absorption:**

Be mindful that phytates in grains can inhibit magnesium absorption. Techniques like soaking, sprouting, or fermenting grains can enhance bioavailability. Additionally, while spinach is rich in magnesium, its high oxalate content may hinder absorption. Lower-oxalate greens like Swiss chard and kale are better options for maximizing magnesium intake.

***

## How can I suppress appetite?

Here’s a list of the best foods to suppress your appetite naturally. These foods contain potent compounds to leave you feeling full and satisfied, and prevent insulin spikes to help stabilize your blood sugar.

1\. Coffee

2\. Avocado

3\. Dark chocolate

4\. Cayenne pepper

5\. Apple cider vinegar

6\. Green tea

7\. Bone broth

8\. Protein-rich meals

9\. Ginger

10\. Dark leafy green vegetables

11\. Olive oil

12\. MCT oil

13\. Turmeric

14\. Zinc

15\. Kombucha tea

16\. Grapefruit

17\. Arugula

18\. Full-fat protein

Eating fatty protein or fat with protein prevents a high insulin spike, which lowers your blood sugar. Avoiding this dip in blood sugar can reduce cravings and curb hunger. Eating fiber also helps buffer the insulin response. Light exercise, like a long walk, is excellent for your blood sugar and can help reduce cravings. An extra 30 minutes of sleep significantly reduces cortisol, stabilizing blood sugar and suppressing appetite naturally. Minimize stress with exercise, physical work, sleep, a healthy diet, and stretching. Ashwagandha is also beneficial, along with magnesium glycinate before bed.

***

## How can I visualize my plate instead of counting macros?

The three macronutrients are proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Most foods are not 100% one macro—they often contain multiple macros.

Let’s start breaking down your meal plate.

**You want the majority of your carbohydrates to come from vegetables.** The average person needs at least 7 cups/servings of vegetables every day. One cup of vegetables is roughly a fist full of salad. If you’re consuming more dense vegetables—broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers, carrots—then you only need about 3.5 cups/servings per day. You can also include a small number of berries in your diet, which count as carbohydrates.

**Olives, hummus, and avocados are a combination of carbohydrates and fats**. Fats and proteins are often combined. The fattiest proteins are the best to consume on a healthy keto diet. Avoid all low-fat proteins and do not trim the fat off of full-fat meats.

**3-5 oz of protein per meal is ideal.** For men, this is 1-2 pieces of protein that are about the size of the palm of your hand. For women, about 1 palm worth of protein. This would be similar to 2-4 eggs, one handful of nuts, 2 thumb-sized pieces of cheese, or 1-2 thumb-sized servings of nut butter.

***

## How do avocados benefit you?

Avocado consumption supports healthy weight, improves skin and vision health, and lowers the risk of developing diseases, including heart disease, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, certain cancers, and arthritis.

Avocados promote weight loss and support weight maintenance. They contain around 75% fat and are high in fiber, promoting satiety and reducing hunger. Avocados also contain a fat molecule called avocatin B, which boosts your metabolism and promotes fat-burning.

Avocados are rich sources of insoluble fiber linked to digestive health and improved detoxification. This type of fiber helps the beneficial bacteria in your gut to thrive, supporting immune function and lowering inflammation.

Several of the nutrients in avocados have potent antioxidant properties, including vitamin E, vitamin C, and the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin. Antioxidants protect your cells from harmful oxidative damage linked to premature aging and the development of diseases.

***

## How do I incorporate nightshades into my diet?

**Incorporating Nightshades into Your Diet**

**Balance Your Nutrient Intake:** Nightshade vegetables can be a valuable addition to your diet when consumed in moderation. To maximize their benefits, pair them with other nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens and fatty fish.

**Dietary Considerations:** For those on specialized diets, such as ketogenic or intermittent fasting, nightshades can be included in moderation. Ensure they align with your dietary goals and monitor for any sensitivities or adverse effects.

***

## How do I know if an avocado is ready to eat?

Ripe avocados have dark, almost black skin with a bumpy texture. They are firm but do yield somewhat if pressure is applied.

A firm avocado with green, smooth skin is likely underripe and needs a few more days to ripen. If an avocado is black, dented, and squishy, it’s overripe and likely will have an unpleasant texture and bitter taste.

***

## How do I know if I'm drinking too much water?

Excessive water intake can dilute sodium levels, leading to a dangerous condition called hyponatremia. It's important to drink appropriate amounts to stay hydrated without overdoing it. While some individuals may need more water to prevent hypercalcemia or kidney stones, generally, it's best to drink according to your hydration needs rather than forcing large quantities.

***

## How do I know if the L. reuteri yogurt is working?

Dr. Davis's L. reuteri yogurt can help in many ways. Look for these signs after consuming the yogurt regularly for at least 3 weeks:

* Strengthened immune system
* Enhanced muscle tone and healing
* Improved digestion and gut motility
* Improved hair condition
* Increase libido

The L. reuteri must colonize in the gut for these signs to appear. It is recommended to perform a stool sample to test for bacterial strains before starting the L. reuteri yogurt and again 6 weeks after you have started. The count of L. reuteri in the stoll should increase dramatically. If you have already begun with the L. reuteri yogurt, you can take a stool sample test to determine the amount of L. reuteri in your stool, which will help determine if they are colonizing in your gut. A low level of L. reuteri in a stool sample is generally considered below 1,000 colony-forming units (CFU) per gram of stool. There is no specific “optimal” level of Lactobacillus reuteri in stool samples established in the current research. Low levels may indicate insufficient colonization, possibly due to poor diet, stress, or lack of supplementation or improper yogurt preparation.

***

## How do I store vegetables correctly?

**Optimal Vegetable Storage for Nutritional Retention**

**Freezing vs. Refrigeration**

Freezing vegetables is generally more effective than refrigeration for preserving nutrients. The cold temperatures of a freezer slow down the degradation of vitamins and minerals, maintaining the nutritional value of vegetables longer. Frozen vegetables are also convenient and often more economical.

**Refrigeration Tips**

To extend the freshness of refrigerated vegetables, lightly spray them with water to maintain humidity and prevent drying. Store vegetables in airtight containers or plastic bags to reduce air exposure and minimize nutrient loss. Proper refrigeration keeps vegetables fresh and nutritious for extended periods.

***

## How does a person start binge eating?

When you consume carbs, it affects your blood sugar levels. Your blood sugar will end up at a lower state about 30-40 minutes after eating the carbs. This will then increase your cortisol levels and cause you to feel more stressed.

Dopamine (a pleasure hormone) is actually increased with the anticipation of a reward like cookies or ice cream, but not when you’re consuming it. Dopamine doesn’t actually lower cortisol, and your cortisol will be increased after consuming carbs. Medication or alcohol may block stress for longer, but it will come back.

**A few powerful things you can do for stress:**

1\. Take vitamin B1 or nutritional yeast (without synthetic vitamins)

2\. Take magnesium

3\. Drink lemon balm tea

4\. Take L-theanine

5\. Take an adaptogen like ashwagandha

## How does caffeine work on the body?

Caffeine is known to give you energy but how does this happen? It blocks adenosine, which is a chemical that inhibits your central nervous system. It’s the breaks of your nervous system. It increases dopamine which let you temporarily handle depression, inability to manage stress, focus…etc.

Too much caffeine might increase artery stiffness down the road. It also depletes vitamin B1, calcium, and potassium. So too much is not okay, but you can do a small amount of it.

***

## How long does Dr. Davis's fermented juice drink made with Florastor stay good?

The fermented juice drink made with Florastor (Saccharomyces boulardii) should be refrigerated within 48 hours of fermentation to halt the process and prevent alcohol production. Once refrigerated, it typically remains good for up to 7–10 days, similar to fresh apple cider or juice, depending on storage conditions and sanitation practices.

It’s important to note that while refrigeration slows down the fermentation process, it doesn’t stop it completely. Always check for off smells, tastes, or unusual changes as spoilage indicators before consuming.

To ensure the best quality and safety:

1\. Store the fermented juice in a clean, airtight container in the refrigerator.

2\. Consume within 7-10 days for optimal freshness and probiotic benefits.

3\. Shake gently before serving, as some settling may occur.

4\. Start with small quantities (1/4 to 1/2 cup) and observe how your body responds.

## How to choose correct fats to add my salads?

Now that you know why fat is essential for nutrient absorption, let's talk about choosing the right types of fat for your salad. Not all fats are created equal when it comes to health benefits.

#### **Healthy Fats vs. Low-Fat Dressings**

You might think light or fat-free salad dressings are always better, but scientific research reveals they can block vegetable nutrient absorption.

A [study from Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2012/120619FerruzziSalad.html) found that people who ate salads with fat-free dressing absorbed far less carotenoids and other fat-soluble nutrients than those who used regular salad dressing containing fat.

#### **The Best Oils for Salad Dressings**

So, what are the best oils to use in your salad dressing? Experts recommend choosing oils that are high in healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, such as:

* [Olive oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-olive-oil-be-the-next-ibuprofen)
* [Avocado oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-benefits-of-avocado-oil)
* Walnut oil
* Flaxseed oil

Good oils do more than aid in nutrient absorption—they're also vital for heart health. Take olive oil, a favorite in [the Mediterranean diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-the-mediterranean-diet-has-not-worked-for-you), which significantly reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension.

Incorporating healthy fats into your diet, especially in marine fish, can offer extensive nutritional benefits and support overall well-being. These beneficial oils contribute to a proper diet and enhance the flavors of various dishes, making them an essential component of cooking and healthy living.

Focusing on these nutritious fats can help protect your heart and improve your dietary habits for better health outcomes.

On the other hand, it's best to limit saturated fats like butter and [coconut oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/coconut-oil-benefits), as well as highly processed vegetable oils like soybean and canola oil. When consumed in excess, these fats can contribute to inflammation and other health issues.

## How to choose the right peanut butter?

Peanuts don't typically cause health issues, but they can cause bloating for some people, and it's still important to consume the right peanuts. Peanuts are not nuts—they are legumes that grow in the soil. Conventional peanuts are heavily sprayed with pesticides and fungicides, which seep into the soil and penetrate their thin shells. This is why you should always choose organic peanuts and peanut butter. Glyphosate is also commonly found in peanuts. Glyphosate can act as an antibiotic and is found in many GMO foods.

Always read the label on your peanut butter and ensure it doesn't contain hydrogenated oils. Hydrogenated vegetable oils don’t actually come from vegetables at all—they’re seed oils! Also, avoid peanut butter with added sugar.

Monoglycerides are sometimes added to peanut butter. A French study linked this ingredient to cancer and found that it can increase the risk of certain cancers by 46%. Look for peanut butter that only contains peanuts and salt. Organic Valencia peanut butter that contains only Valencia peanuts and sea salt is the best option. Valencia peanuts contain the least amount of aflatoxins. Aflatoxins come from mold and can be very damaging to the liver. Try to have your peanuts with a meal rather than as a snack to avoid spiking insulin.

## How to determine if I'm addicted to sweets?

First, let’s talk about the differences between an addiction and a habit. Some people who crave sweets don’t realize that they are addicted. They may just say that they “love sweets.”

An addiction is something that you feel like you cannot live without. For instance, if you couldn’t have sweets for a day, would you go crazy, or would you be alright? A habit is something you could go without, but if you have the option, you would most likely choose to have sweets.

The first step is to acknowledge you have an addiction. Keep in mind that sweets are so addicting, they are even more addicting than drugs.

The problem many people make is going on a diet and trying to quit sweet things altogether. You have to have a substitute first. You can use numerous other sweeteners that will give you the same satisfaction that sugar does, but without the blood sugar spikes. Stevia is a common natural sweetener that you can use.

Over time, your body will readapt to having lower amounts of sugar. In fact, you’ll stop feeling sugar cravings. You’ll also reverse insulin resistance.

## How to understand my body's nutritional needs?

Finding the ideal nutrition plan involves more than weight loss or muscle gain; it’s about discovering what truly energizes you. Experimenting with different diets and observing your body’s response is essential for tailoring a plan that works best for you.

**The Role of Personal Experimentation**

Testing and adjusting various diets helps identify what suits your body. This practical approach is crucial for optimizing your health and nutrition.

**The Challenge with Vegetarian Diets**

A vegetarian diet can lead to gaps in essential nutrients like vitamins D and B12, typically found in animal products, and may offer less protein compared to meat. Thoughtful planning and including diverse plant-based proteins, such as quinoa and tofu, can help bridge these gaps.

## I have no appetite should I eat?

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/should-i-eat-if-i-am-not-hungry-no-appetite-drberg-on-loss-of-appetite)

**Food has two purposes, to provide the body with fuel and with nutrients. If you are nutritionally deficient, which most people are, you may have problems going longer than a day without food. Low blood pressure and fainting episodes are common in people who go too long without eating.**

Most people need to eat once a day, even if they have no appetite. If weight loss is not your goal, you should consume 2 meals per day, also if you don’t have an appetite. You don’t have to consume a large meal if you have no appetite. Try consuming a small salad with a small amount of protein and fat.

Your stomach will shrink when you’re doing intermittent fasting. Your requirement for food will be less, so you won't need as many calories. You won’t even need the same amount of nutrients in some cases. This may cause your appetite to decrease.

In the morning if you have no appetite, don’t eat! Go as long as you can, but try to eat at least once per day to ensure your body gets enough nutrients.

## Interesting Facts About Sugar

1\. It’s not just the amount of carbohydrates that matters. It’s also the quality of the carbs. You have to consume less than 50 grams of net carbs per day to get into ketosis. But, there is a big difference between consuming 50 grams of sugar carbs vs. 50 grams of carbs in general. For example, 50 grams of carbohydrates from sugar would be equivalent to a twelve-ounce orange soda. But 50 grams of net carbs from vegetables is equivalent to about 42 cups of salad.

2\. The liver treats fructose like alcohol. Most types of sugar are really fifty percent glucose and fifty percent fructose. When you check your blood sugar, you’re really only looking at the glucose. Fructose doesn’t affect the blood sugar by that much. Instead, it affects the liver. Even though fructose doesn’t raise your blood sugar levels, it can create other serious issues. These issues can include a fatty liver, high triglycerides, high cholesterol, free radical damage, inflammation, insulin resistance, and diabetes.

3\. Just because it’s from beets doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Most of the sugar used in the US is from beets and is genetically modified, so there are traces of glyphosate. There is an in-depth process to produce beet sugar, and the end product is refined and overly processed.

4\. The chemistry of glucose is similar to vitamin C. This means that glucose and vitamin C are competitive to a certain degree. If you consume sugar, your body won’t absorb vitamin C.

## Is alkaline water safe to consume?

Natural water from a well or spring is alkaline. It’s alkaline because it contains minerals like calcium and magnesium. Many people believe that things that are acidic are unhealthy and things that are alkaline are healthy. But that’s not altogether true. We have a lot of different acids in our bodies that have many important functions.

We don’t need to worry about alkalizing the body. The body regulates the pH in different areas. For example, your blood should be slightly alkaline, but your stomach should be very acidic. It’s possible to get alkaline water created by a machine that uses electricity to alter it instead of using minerals to alkalize it. If you drink alkaline water that's created artificially, you’re going to alter the pH in the stomach.

**Potential side effects of alkaline water made artificially can include:**

• Heartburn

• Acid reflux

• Gas

• GERD

• Infection

• Hair loss

• Heart arrhythmias

However, natural water, like alkaline spring water, has no side effects. Alkalizing the stomach could lead to a deficiency in stomach acids. The stomach should be very acidic to help you break down protein, absorb minerals and vitamin B12, and kill pathogens. As we age, we lose stomach acid. Antacids also weaken stomach acid. But, low stomach acid is the root cause of symptoms like heartburn, GERD, and acid reflux. Alkalizing the stomach instead of acidifying it could worsen these symptoms and lead to many other serious side effects. I’ve found that I can digest better when I drink acidic water, like carbonated water—especially if I add a teaspoon of either apple cider vinegar or lemon juice. Overall, alkaline water has certain health benefits because it contains minerals. But alkaline water is only beneficial if it’s natural and not created by a machine.

***

## Is allulose a good alternative sweetener?

Allulose is an excellent sweetener, as it has a zero glycemic index and is not classified as a sugar alcohol. Erythritol is another good option, while xylitol, though effective, is not glycemic-index-free. Avoid sweeteners like maltitol, maltose, mannitol, sorbitol, Splenda, and synthetic sugars like maltodextrin, which is commonly found in keto-friendly products but may not be ideal.

***

## Is allulose hard on the liver?

No, allulose isn’t hard on the liver because it isn’t metabolized and is excreted in urine unchanged. Using allulose instead of sugar may lower the risk of fatty liver disease by reducing visceral and liver fat.

***

## Is avocado oil healthy?

Yes, avocado oil is a great choice to promote a healthy body. [Avocado oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-benefits-of-avocado-oil) is a rich source of heart-healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals.

Avocado oil has similar health benefits to avocados and helps lower blood pressure, increase heart-healthy cholesterol, and reduce inflammation. Avocado oil has a high smoke point, meaning it can be safely heated to high temperatures. This makes it an excellent cooking oil.

***

## Is buffalo mozzarella healthier than standard mozzarella?

Whether buffalo mozzarella is healthier than standard mozzarella depends largely on the quality and production methods. Authentic buffalo mozzarella, particularly from regions in Italy where traditional practices are upheld, often has higher nutritional value and superior taste due to the use of raw milk and artisanal techniques. In contrast, much of the cheese produced in the U.S. may involve shortcuts, which can affect quality. When choosing mozzarella, it’s important to seek out products with transparent sourcing and traditional methods, as these factors significantly influence the health benefits and overall quality of the cheese.

***

## Is cantaloupe juice beneficial?

While cantaloupe juice contains valuable nutrients, its high sugar content, especially when juiced, poses concerns. Juicing removes the fiber that helps regulate sugar absorption, leading to a direct intake of fructose, which may not be ideal, particularly for those managing blood sugar levels. I’ve learned from personal experience—once juicing large amounts of carrot juice until noticing a skin color change—that moderation is key. Cleanses involving sugary juices or glucose can prevent full adaptation to ketosis, making fasting more challenging and intensifying cravings. For effective cleansing and fasting, it's crucial to consider the impact of sugar and opt for methods that support metabolic balance.

***

## Is carbonated water healthier than still water?

There’s no evidence that carbonated water is better or worse for you than non-carbonated water. However, when some people consume carbonated water, their digestion is better.

That could be because:

* Carbonic acid could buffer the pH
* It acidifies the digestive system

Below a pH of 7, things are more acidic. Because the stomach has the lowest pH of any part of the body, carbonic acid – being a weak acid – might be better than regular water for some people.

Types of carbonated water:

* Seltzer water – no minerals, carbonated
* Club soda – minerals, carbonated
* Tonic water – quinine, carbonated

***

## Is celery juice good for hydration?

**Celery Juice and Hydration**

Celery juice is an excellent choice for hydration, boasting a high water content of 95%. This makes it a beneficial addition to your daily routine for maintaining adequate fluid levels.

**Benefits of Hydration:** Proper hydration is essential for overall health, supporting functions such as temperature regulation, digestion, and nutrient absorption. Regular consumption of celery juice can help prevent dehydration and its associated symptoms, including fatigue and headaches.

***

## Is cereal safe for kids to eat?

**The worst time to feed someone cereal is when they’re an infant. I**nfant rice cereal, which is very popular, has inorganic arsenic. In the soils where grains and plants are grown, there is always going to be some arsenic in very small amounts. This is called organic arsenic. Our bodies can actually deal with this very easily. But, inorganic arsenic is different and is not healthy. There is even an interesting study that talks about the exposure of infants to cereal, increasing the risk of autoimmune diseases. Infants also don’t have the enzymes to digest the cereal.

**The other big problem is the amount of sugar in cereal.** This could set the child up for blood sugar issues down the road. With some cereals, 1 cup is equal to the amount of sugar in a Twinkie.

**The whole grains in cereal also contain phytate.** Phytate is a chemical in grains that will block the absorption of zinc and other important minerals. Many kids also have an allergy to gluten, which is in many kinds of cereal.

**GMO grains** have also been exposed to glyphosate, which can create problems with the immune system. The fortification of cereal with synthetic vitamins can also cause problems.

## Is coconut sugar a good alternative sugar?

Coconut sugar is not a good alternative. The worst sugar is agave nectar. But coconut sugar has just too much sugar. So you're going to have to do something like xylitol or erythritol as your sugar alternative, or stevia or monk fruit, because these other sugars just are going to blow your sugars out.

***

## Is coffee going to affect my insulin?

It's not going to affect your insulin. If you can handle 3 cups of coffee and if you sleep okay should be fine because the biggest problem with the caffeine is if your liver is really strong and it can detoxify the caffeine and you can sleep go for it. But if you start having it affect your sleep, then we know that's the issue.

## Is erythritol bad?

A new study on erythritol and heart attacks has been in the news and found its way to social media—let’s talk about it. This study correlates erythritol in your blood to higher incidents of heart attacks and strokes. However, I see some serious problems with this study.

Here are four key points about this study:

1\. Correlation does not mean causation.

2\. This study was based on endogenous erythritol and did not measure dietary erythritol. The body makes endogenous erythritol.

3\. The body produces erythritol when you metabolize sugar, have oxidative stress or belly fat, or consume alcohol. The great majority of people in this study were in poor health, so how do we know erythritol was the problem?

4\. Other research has liked erythritol to many different health benefits. Could it be that erythritol is increasing in the body to counter the bad effects of sugar? It seems to me that erythritol is something that’s trying to help you and not hurt you.

## Is Hibiscus safe during pregnancy?

Some compounds in hibiscus have estrogenic properties, meaning they can interfere with normal estrogen balance. Estrogen is the primary female sex hormone that regulates many aspects of fertility and pregnancy, and it’s not recommended to consume any hibiscus products during pregnancy.

***

## Is Hibiscus tea dangerous while pregnant?

Hibiscus has estrogenic effects, which can potentially mimic the effects of estrogen, the primary female sex hormone.

These effects can either interfere with normal estrogen signaling or amplify estrogen's impact, which can result in an increased risk of bleeding during the first trimester and may trigger premature labor.

## Is licorice root in supplements heathy?

Licorice root in supplements can be healthy when used appropriately. Dr. Berg highlights its numerous benefits, such as helping to balance cortisol levels, reducing inflammation, supporting liver detoxification, and aiding conditions like ulcers, gastritis, and viral hepatitis. It is also an adaptogen, meaning it helps the body manage stress by regulating cortisol levels.

Dr. Berg uses licorice root in his Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula supplement because of its adaptogenic properties and ability to support adrenal health and stress relief. However, he cautions against excessive use, as it can lead to side effects like potassium loss, sodium retention, or increased blood pressure in sensitive individuals.

***

## Is plant-based meat legit?

It's important to understand that the marketing of plant-based meats as universally healthier and more environmentally friendly than real meat presents a simplified picture. Here's why:

* **Nutritional Differences:** While plant-based meats can offer some nutrients, they often lack the full range found in real meat, particularly protein, B vitamins, iron, selenium, and zinc. Manufacturers may use supplements and additives to compensate, but these don't fully replicate the natural nutrient profile of real meat.
* **Processing Concerns:** Plant-based meats rely on significant processing. Some ingredients, like the synthetic heme in the Impossible Burger, raise questions about long-term safety due to limited testing.
* **Environmental Complexity:** The environmental impact of plant-based meats isn't always clear-cut. They require considerable resources for production, including water and land. Some ingredients, like almonds, have notoriously high water demands.
* **Real Meat's Role in the Ecosystem:** Real meat production can utilize resources inedible by humans and helps maintain land unsuitable for crops. Cow manure is a natural fertilizer, and livestock grazing plays a role in land health.
* **Methane in Context:** While livestock methane emissions are a concern, their estimated contribution is around 2.7% of total emissions. This needs to be weighed against the carbon cycle, where plants absorb carbon dioxide, which is partly converted to methane by livestock, eventually breaking down back into carbon dioxide.

***

## Is pork meat inflammatory?

Yes, pork can be inflammatory, especially if it is commercially bought and highly processed. Here are some key points from Dr. Berg's recommendations:

* **Commercially Bought Pork**: Commercially bought pork is often highly processed and may contain GMO grains, soy, and corn in the animal feed. Additionally, antibiotics and arsenic-based drugs are commonly used in livestock treatments, which can contribute to inflammation.
* **Formaldehyde in Feed**: Formaldehyde is sometimes used in pork feed to fight off bacteria, which can pose serious health risks and contribute to inflammation.
* **Processed Meats**: Processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which are often made from pork, are high in trans fats and can increase inflammation in the body.

To reduce inflammation, it is recommended to choose pasture-raised or grass-fed pork, which is less likely to contain harmful additives and is higher in beneficial nutrients.

***

## Is pure alcohol keto-friendly?

You may have heard of keto-friendly wine or that pure alcohol is keto-friendly. Pure alcohol is not a carb or sugar and doesn’t directly increase your blood sugar or insulin. However, indirectly, it can create severe insulin resistance. Liver cells treat alcohol like poison and try to get rid of it. The toxicity of the alcohol injures the liver cells and can even kill them. During this process, you develop fat in the liver cells, which can lead to a fatty liver. With a fatty liver, you can also experience inflammation and scarring in the liver. Chronic inflammation and scarring can then cause cirrhosis and increase your risk of liver cancer and other liver problems. Alcohol also blocks your ability to burn fat. Don’t expect to burn fat for 48 to 72 hours after alcohol consumption. It’s a source of empty calories and depletes important nutrients.

You’ve probably heard that there are certain benefits of drinking alcohol in moderation. But, recently, they’ve found that was only a marketing tactic, and there are no benefits to drinking alcohol.

***

## Is quinoa considered a carb?

Yes, it's a grain. We want to stay away from grains. It's not just about the carbs and grains. It's also about the phytic acid and other things that prevent nutrient absorption, and then the high omega-6 fats versus very low omega-3 fats.

***

## Is raw milk safe for consumption?

Many people believe that raw milk is the number one cause of pathogens in dairy, but is it the raw milk itself causing the problem, or is it contaminated milk? It's important to remember that just because something is pasteurized doesn't automatically make it safe. It's also important to understand that E. coli is not just found in raw milk but can be present in pasteurized milk, too. In fact, we all have E. coli bacteria in our gut right now, which helps with digestion. The problem arises when certain strains of E. coli become pathogenic due to unsanitary conditions on the farm where the milk is produced.

This is why knowing where you're getting your dairy products from is crucial, and ensuring that the farm follows strict hygiene protocols. If proper precautions are taken and the farm is clean, raw milk can be a beneficial option. One of the main benefits of consuming raw milk and raw milk cheese is that they contain enzymes that aid digestion. For example, lactase helps break down lactose (milk sugar) making it easier to digest for those intolerant to lactose. Raw dairy products also contain probiotic-friendly bacteria that support our immune system and gut health.

Research has shown that children who consume raw milk have lower incidences of asthma, allergies, ear infections, and respiratory infections than those who consume pasteurized milk. Choosing high-quality raw dairy products from grass-fed cows also provides additional benefits, such as higher levels of essential minerals, including calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which can aid in weight loss and have anti-inflammatory effects. Of course, it's important to research and purchase grass-fed raw dairy products from a reputable source that prioritizes cleanliness.

## Is sheep milk healthier than goat milk?

Studies have shown that between sheep, cow, and goat milk, sheep milk is the healthiest. Goat milk is also a healthy option because it contains A2 casein, making it easier to digest than cow milk.

***

## Is snacking good for low blood sugars?

Snacking makes low blood sugar worse over time. Every time you eat a snack insulin is triggered, causing your blood sugars to drop again, which makes you want another snack. Snacks will not help improve low blood sugar meaningfully. Instead, try adopting a Healthy Keto® diet, as this will aid your body in regulating blood sugar levels properly.

## Is stevia a good sugar substitute to add to my diet?

**Is Stevia a Good Sugar Substitute?**

Dr. Eric Berg confirms that plain stevia is a beneficial addition to your diet. As a natural, zero-calorie sweetener, stevia does not raise blood sugar levels or contribute to health issues related to excessive sugar consumption. Opting for high-quality, plain stevia products ensures you reap the benefits while avoiding unwanted additives.

**Stevia vs. Sucralose**

In the search for healthier sugar alternatives, stevia and sucralose are often compared. Stevia, derived from the Stevia rebaudiana plant, offers zero calories and minimal impact on blood sugar. Sucralose, an artificial sweetener, provides sweetness without calories but may raise concerns about its effects on blood sugar. Evaluating these options helps make informed decisions about sweeteners and their impact on health.

***

## Is stevia better than sucralose?

Yes, stevia is considered a better choice than sucralose. Stevia is a natural sweetener derived from the stevia plant and has been linked to various potential health benefits. In contrast, sucralose is a zero-calorie artificial sweetener that may increase the risk of weight gain, poor detoxification processes, and an imbalanced intestinal microflora.

***

## Is tap water generally safe to drink?

**Tap water is toxic - especially if you live in the southern part of the United States, where there are high levels of estrogen in the water. These high levels of estrogen can shut down testosterone in men and put a woman into estrogen dominance.**

There is also fluoride in tap water, which can affect the thyroid and skin. On top of that there is a chemical called chloramine, which is not good for the body.

The fact that there is a legal dose of these chemicals in tap water does not mean that they are safe. The legal limits of these contaminants have not been evaluated for 20 years.

The following are a few chemicals that could be in your tap water. Four of these five chemicals are known to cause cancer.

* Bromodichloromethane
* Chloroform
* Haloacetic acid
* Nitrates
* TTHM (total trihalomethanes)

***

## Is the regular protein powder safe to consume?

Maltodextrin, a common ingredient in many protein powders and processed foods, poses several health risks. It has been linked to acne, bloating, gut inflammation, irritability, anxiety, and insomnia due to its addictive nature and impact on dopamine levels.

Moreover, maltodextrin promotes tooth decay, spikes blood sugar more than sugar, and contributes to belly fat, high cholesterol, fatty liver, and other health issues with repeated consumption.

Derived from inedible dent corn through a chemical process, maltodextrin acts as a filler in various products. Classified as a carbohydrate, it functions as a sugar in the body, with a glycemic index exceeding that of glucose and table sugar.

Many protein powders contain a high proportion of maltodextrin compared to protein, leading to excessive carbohydrate intake and increased nutrient requirements.

Ultra-processed foods like maltodextrin trigger oxidation and inflammation, causing significant insulin and blood sugar spikes. This can result in fatigue, low blood sugar, and cravings, perpetuating a cycle that may lead to insulin resistance.

For optimal muscle building, focus on exercise and protein intake rather than consuming high amounts of refined sugar like maltodextrin.

## Is whey protein healthy to consume?

Whey protein is a unique type of protein. It's one type of protein in the dairy. It's not casein. And a lot of people take it for bodybuilding and muscle repair and to replace the amino acids. If you look at the bioavailability, it's not on the top of the list. It's kind of lower. But it is very, very, very high on another scale called the insulin index. And those are all the – they don't look for foods that spike your blood sugars like the glycemic index. They're looking for foods that will spike the actual insulin.

And that's what we're trying to really ultimately keep down. On one note, you're going to get a spike of insulin when you take whey. And that may not be a bad thing if you are trying to gain muscle or weight because you also at the same time spike the opposing hormone called glucagon. So it kind of does help to neutralize it to some degree. It's not like eating sugar. But you just have to experiment and see how well your body handles the whey protein. Because it's very low fat, it's a lean protein, that's why it spikes insulin a little bit more than other things, actually a lot more. You may want to try a protein or amino acid that has more fat or add fat with it. Some people do really good on it. A lot of the powders out there, they don't just have the whey protein. They have maltodextrin too.

## Medications Outbreak

In a sampling of 100 residents, the average resident is on 48 medications. Some residents were even taking up to 91 medications! This isn’t healthcare.

Dementia is the top problem in assisted living homes and is extremely expensive, costing an average of $800,000 to $1.5 million per person. Hal explains that dementia starts in your 30s and 40s, so it’s a very difficult condition to reverse. Under Hal’s protocol, he has seen improvement, even in people with dementia.

The US healthcare system is focused on medicine, not food, but food is the most significant contributor to your health! Medications treat the side effects of junk food consumption, and the side effects of medications are then treated with more medication.

The ultimate goal should be to decrease medications, get people off them, and hopefully help them regain independence. The current healthcare model does not support these goals. One record for a single patient shows they’re on medication for high blood pressure, cholesterol, tremors, blood clots, stool softeners, antidepressants, seizures, insulin, schizophrenia, runny nose, nausea, prostate enlargement, and more. This is insane! Failing to address the diet before prescribing these medications misses the root cause of the problems.

## Nutrition Strategies for Optimal Muscle Gain

Macronutrient Balance: Achieving muscle growth requires a careful balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Aim for approximately 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight to support muscle repair and growth. Include healthy fats—like those from avocados, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish—targeting around 0.5 grams per pound of body weight for hormone production and overall health.

Keto, Fasting, and Exercise: Combining ketogenic principles and intermittent fasting with strategic exercise routines enhances muscle development. Brined chicken thighs are a valuable addition, offering lean protein that supports muscle growth and aligns with both keto and fasting protocols.

## Protein Bars Are WORSE than Candy Bars!!!

Let's compare popular snack bars to see what they really offer.

**Snickers:**

* 50 grams, 30 grams carbs, 58% sugar.

**Protein Bars:**

* **CLIF Builder's:** 68 grams, 20 grams protein (low-quality soy), high sugar, ultra-processed.
* **CLIF Energy:** 68 grams, 55.88% sugar, provides a short energy spike followed by a crash.
* **KIND:** Claims like "low glycemic index" are misleading, contains glucose syrup and other sugars.
* **Quest Birthday Cake:** 9 grams sugar alcohol (can cause GI issues), 41% sugar, contains polydextrose (not well-studied in humans).
* **Pure Protein:** Claims 2 grams sugar, but has 14 grams of starches (equivalent to more sugar).
* **ONE:** 60 grams, 20 grams protein, but 25 grams carbs from starches and cellulose (essentially sawdust), contains maltitol (avoid).
* **MET-Rx Meal Replacement:** 48 grams carbs, contains rice starch, maltitol syrup, corn syrup, fructose, soy protein isolate.

**Other Bars:**

* **RXBAR:** 10 grams protein, oats, cashews, egg whites, honey, but misleadingly labeled as 52% of its ingredients are sugar.

In summary, while marketed as healthier options, many snack bars contain high amounts of sugar, low-quality protein, and other questionable ingredients. It's important to read labels carefully and consider whole food alternatives for sustained energy and nutrition.

## Should I add fats to my salad?

Your body requires fat to absorb essential nutrients because many phytochemicals, such as carotenoids, are fat-soluble. Without sufficient fat, these nutrients may pass through your digestive system without being properly absorbed.

Studies indicate that including fat in your salad can enhance the absorption of carotenoids like beta-carotene and lycopene by up to 15 times compared to fat-free salads.

***

## Should I consume kale daily?

Incorporating kale into your daily diet can offer significant health benefits. Regular consumption of kale juice may reduce cancer risk due to its high concentration of cancer-fighting phytonutrients and antioxidants, which protect cells from damage by free radicals.

Additionally, kale supports cardiovascular health by lowering blood pressure and reducing inflammation. Its potassium content aids in blood pressure regulation, while its anti-inflammatory compounds help prevent arterial plaque buildup.

***

## Should I do a vegetarian diet for hyperthyroidism?

For hyperthyroidism, it's crucial to avoid iodine, as it can exacerbate the condition. While iodine may help with thyroid nodules in some cases, it’s not recommended for hyperthyroidism. Instead, consider foods that naturally block iodine absorption, such as cruciferous vegetables. Also, avoid supplements containing bile salts, like Gallbladder Formula, as they can stimulate the thyroid. Incorporating natural vitamin B1 (thiamine) at a higher dosage than standard recommendations may also be beneficial in managing hyperthyroidism.

***

## Should I eat dairy with kidney stones?

To reduce kidney stone risk, focus on:

Foods to Avoid High in Oxalates:

\- Nuts

Recommended Calcium-Rich Foods:

\- Seeds

\- Sardines

\- Fish

\- Seafood

\- Dark green vegetables

Beneficial Citrates for Kidney Health:

\- Potassium citrates

\- Magnesium citrates

\- Calcium citrates

Consider hydroxy citrate supplements or lemon juice to prevent oxalate crystal formation. If sensitive to dairy, choose grass-fed options to lower omega-6 fatty acids, which can increase inflammation.

## Small American Farmers in Serious Crisis: The Back Story

**The Regulatory Roadblocks for Small Farmers**

Joel Salatin believes our food system is overly regulated. Government, food, and zoning laws create massive hurdles for small farmers trying to compete. That's why he and John Moody founded the Rogue Food Conference in 2020. Their motto? "Circumvention, not compliance." When laws stifle fair competition, they advocate finding creative ways to work around excessive regulation.

The upcoming Rogue Food Conference at Joel's Polyface Farms in Virginia will explore these strategies. Expect discussions on private membership associations and clever models like selling food as part of a course (think a $300 butchering class that includes 50 pounds of meat).

The conference happens twice a year – this year in Virginia (spring) and Dallas (fall).

Want to support the cause? Ditch the big supermarkets and shop at farmers' markets for locally grown, healthier food. Seek out small, independent food stores, and don't be afraid to ask for specific items – even if not currently in stock, farmers have a great network!

Finding real food from dedicated farmers might take effort, but the health benefits are undeniable.

## The Dangers of Excessive Salt Consumption

Ever felt puffy after a salty meal? That's your body dealing with excess sodium.

But it isn't just about bloating or increased thirst - the real worry lies beneath. [Consuming excessive sodium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/low-salt-increases-your-risk-of-heart-attacks) can result in difficulties such as elevated blood pressure and cardiovascular illness.

Sure, you need some salt for proper bodily function. Yet, how much is too little? Could insufficient sodium hamper physical performance or drop your blood pressure dangerously low?

We'll dig deep into these questions as we navigate through this post. We're going on an exciting journey to understand why nutrition is critical in our diet - particularly between two crucial minerals: [Sodium and Potassium](https://www.drberg.com/blog/important-information-on-potassium-and-sodium).

So, are you ready to take the plunge? Let's explore Baja Gold Salt – a healthier choice for those mindful of sodium levels. Hang tight and prepare to venture beyond your usual table salt!

**The Downside of Low Sodium Intake**

Low sodium intake isn't without its pitfalls. One significant issue is how it impacts our physical performance. Sodium is crucial in maintaining fluid balance and nerve function, both essential for athletic endeavors.

#### **The Impact of Sodium Deficiency on Physical Performance**

Athletes often notice the first signs of low sodium levels during intense workouts or games. They may feel weak, tired, and even dizzy. This happens because their bodies struggle to maintain an optimal fluid balance when sodium levels are too low.

Another downside is [hyponatremia - dangerously low blood sodium levels](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-dangers-of-low-sodium) - which can lead to nausea, headaches, confusion, seizures, or even coma in severe cases.

Inadequate salt intake might also make us more susceptible to heat stroke during high-intensity activities due to decreased sweat, affecting the body's ability to cool down effectively.

#### **Tackling The Issue**

If you're an active person dealing with these symptoms after cutting back on salt significantly – don’t panic. A slight adjustment here and there should fix this problem right up.

## The Most Powerful Group Behind What You Eat

In the food industry, immense power resides with a mere quartet of companies: Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus. These four giants dominate the global grain trade, controlling a staggering 90%. Their influence extends to products derived from corn, soy, wheat, sugar, and rice, which collectively constitute roughly 68% of the average American's caloric intake.

These companies act as intermediaries between farmers and food corporations, wielding significant control over the supply chain. However, the food industry is not without its problems. Rampant corruption exists, with many "junk food brands" also owning organic and natural brands, pet food, and even vitamin and supplement companies.

A common thread among ultra-processed foods is their reliance on starches, sugars, and seed oils. Sugar is employed to create addictive cravings, seed oils are essentially repurposed waste, and starches, composed of sugar chains, serve as fillers.

Worryingly, starches trigger a more dramatic insulin spike than sugar itself. Maltodextrin, a common starch, has a glycemic index of 185, dwarfing sugar's index of 65. The overconsumption of fillers and starches can lead to serious health issues.

Remember, consumer choices hold immense power. By opting for healthier alternatives, we can reduce the demand for these harmful products, thereby influencing the market and promoting positive change.

## The Nutritional Powerhouse of Red Meat

### **The Nutritional Powerhouse of Red Meat**

[Red meat](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-red-meat-really-that-bad-for-you), often seen as a prime protein source, is integral to healing and repair. Red meat contains all nine essential amino acids, which are vital for our bodies and cannot be produced by them.

![Image](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/video-thumbnails/81e2b64a-cf80-439b-9115-9c4218874597.jpg?w=992\&auto=compress,format)

#### **Protein Content in Red Meat**

The abundant protein found in red meat aids the body's natural repair processes. Consuming sufficient amounts helps maintain muscle mass and promotes wound healing. This isn’t just for athletes – everyone benefits from this natural healer.

#### **Essential Vitamins and Minerals in Red Meat**

Besides [proteins](https://www.drberg.com/blog/protein-part-1-how-much-protein-do-i-need), red meat serves up a cocktail of vitamins like B12, niacin (B6), riboflavin (B2), and minerals such as iron. [Iron supports oxygen transport](https://www.drberg.com/blog/are-you-iron-deficient), while the B vitamins are vital for energy production.

[Zinc](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-unexpected-amazing-benefits-of-zinc-that-you-ve-rarely-heard-about), too, deserves a mention; it’s involved in numerous aspects of cellular metabolism.

Let’s not forget about magnesium, which aids nerve function, _and_ Vitamin K, which assists blood clotting - making these nutrients perfect for post-injury recovery. Now, you see why we call it a powerhouse?

### **Unique Compounds in Red Meat Beneficial for Healing**

The beneficial compounds found in red meat aren't just about protein. They also offer a range of unique substances that help with healing and recovery.

#### **Carnitine and Creatine - Energy Producers**

[Carnitine](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-biggest-benefit-of-l-carnitine-is), abundant in red meat, is known to aid the body's energy production by transporting fatty acids into your cells' mitochondria. But it doesn't stop there. It also helps get rid of waste products from these same cells.

Next up is [creatine](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-creatine). This naturally occurring compound plays a critical role when you need quick bursts of energy, making it essential for repairing tissues quickly after injury or during high-intensity workouts.

#### **Carnosine - The Muscle Buffer and Antioxidant**

In addition to its muscle-buffering capabilities, carnosine also shines as an antioxidant powerhouse, protecting your body against damage from harmful free radicals, which can impede the healing process if left unchecked.

#### **Coenzyme Q10 - The Mitochondrial Supporter**

Completing the trio of antioxidant powerhouses is Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Known as the 'mitochondrial supporter,' this coenzyme aids cellular energy production while playing a pivotal role in preventing oxidative stress – vital aspects of efficient healing.

## The Nutritional Void of Fast Food

Fast food lacks essential nutrients like B1, calcium, and zinc, leading to fatigue, mental fog, and weakened immunity.

**Additives and MSG Effects**

Additives and MSG in fast food can disrupt hunger signals and cause bloating.

**Benefits of Quitting Fast Food**

Eliminating fast food can reduce hunger, cravings, and bloating while boosting energy and mental clarity.

**Long-Term Risks**

Consuming fast food frequently can cause nutrient deficiencies, peripheral neuropathy, vision problems, kidney stones, and heart disease. Opt for whole foods to maintain better health.

## THIS Ruins Your Health!

Big Pharma and Big Food both contribute to this health crisis. Chronic disease primarily comes from a diet composed of ultra-processed foods. Doctors prescribe medications to treat symptoms that come from the junk food diet, rather than addressing the diet. Junk food is not food! It’s composed of refined sugars, seed oils, and starches along with colorings, flavorings, and preservatives. Junk food does not sustain life and it’s at the root of chronic disease.

Some people claim that the ketogenic diet is dangerous, but this is untrue. The keto diet involves the breakdown of fat into ketones as an alternative fuel. When you reduce your carb intake, it forces your body to use your fat reserve for fuel. Keto is great for weight loss and can help combat insulin resistance. When cigarettes lost popularity due to health concerns, tobacco companies bought up the junk food industry. These companies produced profitable food junk food made from dent corn and other cheap materials. A high-carb diet has become normalized for major profits.

RFK Jr. is a non-politician who may be able to sever the relationships between the food industry and the government. Food guidelines are of the utmost importance because the consequences trickle down to the schools, hospitals, assisted living homes, and other places that feed the most vulnerable. More doctors are beginning to consider food and the whole body when managing disease, moving away from the symptom management model.

It's important not to overlook the function and importance of vitamin D, turmeric, magnesium, and grass-fed red meat. Focusing on disease prevention by building health rather than treating disease is most effective. Eating real food is the most important thing you can do for your health.

## What are cheese's effects on probiotics?

Processed or pasteurized cheeses may not have significant amounts of live cultures, but certain types of cheese can enhance the growth of beneficial bacteria due to their natural fermentation process. Choose high-quality raw milk cheeses for optimal probiotic content.

***

## What are Dr. Berg's thoughts of drying and grinding eggshells to add a smoothie for extra calcium?

Drying and grinding eggshells for extra calcium in smoothies isn't ideal. The calcium in eggshells is elemental and not easily absorbed by our bodies. Plants, with the help of bacteria, can convert this type of calcium into a more bioavailable form, but humans absorb calcium more effectively when it's bound to proteins, as found in dairy or vegetables. For better calcium absorption, it's recommended to obtain it from dietary sources like dairy products or leafy greens rather than eggshells.

## What are Dr. Berg's thoughts on the consumption of buffalo milk?

The real important thing, way more important than that is if it's raw versus pasteurized because the pasteurization we have a calf that was just born from a cow that was just too small and there is a lot of problems. In fact, to the point where the mother is not feeding the calf. We have to bottle feed it. I've done some research on the pasteurization of milk, even in calves versus raw milk. A huge difference in organs, like the color of your organs, the health of your body. If you're going to do milk, I would definitely go raw. I would, I prefer to have some raw milk in a fermented product like cheese, raw cheese, maybe kefir. ]

## What are some bad food combinations?

You’ve probably heard about food combining. It’s become popular in various diet programs.

**One combination you definitely want to avoid is protein plus sugar (refined carbohydrates), as well as fat plus sugar. When you combine these, especially when you heat them up, you develop something called AGEs.**

Now, what are AGEs? They are what’s called advanced glycation end products. AGEs plug up circulation in the back of your eyes and can cause macular degeneration. They’re also involved in brain chemistry, stopping the neurons from communicating and contributing to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson's.

AGEs are also involved in the beta cells of your pancreas as well as in diabetes.

In other words, these combinations are terrible! How does this relate to your foods? Let’s say, for example, you eat barbecued ribs. Or anything heated with fat and sugar. Like ice cream! Or anything deep-fried. You have fat with carbohydrates and likely wheat which has the protein called gluten.

All the health complications of diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson's involve advanced glycation end products. AGEs create massive oxidation, which essentially is like your body rusting out its arteries, eyes, and kidneys. They age you quickly; your proteins become sticky and brittle.

**You can do these four things to counter the development of AGEs and halt rapid aging:**

1\. Avoid sugar

2\. Consume aged garlic; it’s far more powerful than fresh as an anti-glycation substance

3\. Take carnosine, a combination of two amino acids that’s effective at preventing cataracts

4\. Take benfotiamine, especially if you have diabetes complications such as peripheral neuropathy or impaired vision

## What are some dangerous and bad foods for your body?

**The top deadliest foods:**

1\. Pufferfish (fugu)

2\. Death cap mushroom

3\. Korean baby octopus

4\. Green potatoes

5\. Raw chicken

6\. Foods containing cyanide:

• The seeds or pits of apples, peaches, pears, and apricots

• Bitter almonds

• Cassava

It’s best to avoid any of the above at all costs. If you do somehow consume death cap mushrooms, milk thistle and NAC are two potential antidotes that may help. Methylene blue is another potential antidote that has been used to help counter cyanide poisoning.

## What are some effective strategies for managing sugar intake in children?

As parents, it's our responsibility to help children develop healthy eating habits, particularly in managing sugar intake. By implementing informed strategies, we can support their physical and emotional well-being.

**Understanding Labels:**

\- **Hidden Sugars:** Learn to identify added sugars on labels, such as high fructose corn syrup, glucose, and dextrose. Even "natural" sugars like honey and maple syrup contribute to overall sugar intake and should be consumed in moderation.

\- **Vigilance:** Familiarize yourself with the various names for sugar to make informed food choices for your family.

**Healthy Alternatives:**

\- **Whole Foods:** Replace sugary snacks with naturally sweet and nutritious options like fresh fruits (berries, apples) and vegetables (carrots, bell peppers) paired with hummus or nut butter.

\- **Beverage Choices:** Encourage water, unsweetened herbal teas, or low-fat milk over sugary drinks. For flavored drinks, try infusing water with fresh fruit slices or mint for a refreshing, natural sweetness.

By making these mindful changes, you can help your child maintain a balanced diet and develop healthy lifelong habits.

## What are some healthy foods I need in my diet?

Food is defined as that which is eaten to sustain life, provide energy, and promote the growth and repair of tissues.

By this definition, everything we eat should not be defined as food! Ultra-processed foods do not sustain life, provide energy, or promote the growth of tissues. Ultra-processed foods, also known as junk foods, create the most disease.

Ultra-processed foods can be described as foods that have been altered in an extreme way, either chemically, mechanically, or with heat. These “foods” should be completely eliminated from the diet. Foods like Doritos are packed full of chemically altered GMO ingredients. They contain large amounts of unsaturated fatty acids and are shelf-stable for long periods of time.

Ultra-processed foods often contain three main ingredients: synthetic sugars, synthetic starches, and synthetic seed oils. Avoid these ingredients.

**Here are the 8 healthiest foods:**

1\. Red meat–Grass-fed, grass-finished beef is excellent for your health and is one of the highest sources of glutamine.

2\. Wild-caught fatty fish–Salmon and other fatty fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids.

3\. Shellfish–Shrimp, clams, mussels, and other shellfish contain omega-3s, but they’re also a rich source of trace minerals. Oysters are one of the best sources of zinc.

4\. Eggs–Choose organic pasture-raised eggs.

5\. Fermented vegetables–Sauerkraut and kimchi are excellent sources of probiotics and vitamin C.

6\. Leafy greens–Arugula, spinach, and high-quality lettuce contain folate, vitamin C, magnesium, and potassium. Consuming dairy with spinach can reduce oxalates.

7\. Organ meats–Beef liver, cod liver, and other organ meats are rich in many vitamins, minerals, and trace minerals.

8\. Herbs and spices–Garlic, onion, sage, thyme, sea salt, basil, and cinnamon all have unique properties and important health benefits.

## What are some tips for a balanced and nutrient-dense diet?

1. Focus on [Nutrient-Dense Foods](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-nutrient-dense-food-in-the-world): Fill your plate with whole, unprocessed foods like vegetables, fruits, healthy fats, and lean protein. These foods naturally provide a greater sense of fullness and support stable blood sugar levels.
2. Listen to Your Body's Signals: Learn to differentiate between true hunger cues and emotional eating. This will help you nourish your body when it genuinely needs it and break free from unhealthy eating patterns.
3. Experiment with [Intermittent Fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/intermittent-fasting): If appropriate for you, explore intermittent fasting. This can increase insulin sensitivity and give your digestive system a break, potentially making “moderation” with certain foods more manageable. This doesn't mean you can't enjoy a delicious meal once in a blue moon.

The journey to a healthy relationship with food looks different for everyone.

Incorporating more nutrient-dense whole foods while mindfully approaching those more likely to trigger cravings or blood sugar spikes can create lasting positive change without strict adherence to “everything in moderation."

Always consult a qualified healthcare professional to find a personalized approach that aligns with your unique health needs. Your healthcare provider may even suggest you cut sugar intake or get your sugar fix in a healthy way.

## What are some tips to make my grocery shopping experience better?

Supermarkets employ clever tactics to influence your spending and control your shopping experience. Surprisingly, most of their profits aren't from product markups but from "slotting fees" paid by food companies for prime shelf space.

These companies vie for the "golden zone" at eye level, which can boost sales by up to 8 times. Supermarkets also manipulate store layout, scents, and even floor texture to slow you down and encourage impulse buys.

Other tricks include placing high-priced items near low-priced ones, using color psychology, and employing social proof tactics like "best seller" labels. The cereal aisle, often strategically placed, is a major profit center.

Additionally, 16% of sales occur at the front of the store, where tempting treats like candy are strategically placed. Labels can be deceptive too, with "natural" or "organic" not necessarily meaning healthy.

To outsmart these tactics:

* Avoid shopping with kids or when hungry/tired.
* Make a list and stick to it.
* Shop the perimeter of the store where fresh produce is typically located.
* Steer clear of junk food aisles.

By being aware of these tactics, you can take control of your shopping experience and make healthier choices.

2\. Spinach and grapefruit Combine 1 cup of spinach with 1 grapefruit.

Grapefruit increases your sensitivity to insulin and increases bile flow.

3\. Kale and pomegranate

Cruciferous vegetables like kale aid in liver detoxification and have anti-inflammatory properties. Pomegranate also decreases inflammation and prevents fat from accumulating in the liver.

4\. Papaya Combine one whole chopped papaya with water and ice.

Papaya is loaded with enzymes that can help digestion and decrease inflammation in the liver.

5\. Celery and blueberries Combine 1 cup of chopped celery with 1 cup of blueberries.

Celery Increases bile production and reduces liver inflammation. Blueberries reduce liver fat, and their polyphenols help remove excess iron from the body.

6\. Cucumber and lemon Combine 1 cup of each of these ingredients.

Cucumber is hydrating and has electrolytes. It increases liver detoxification and can help prevent NAFLD. Lemon can also improve liver detoxification.

7\. Avocado and strawberries

Combine 1 cup of each! Avocado contains glutathione, one of the most potent antioxidants, and also has reparative properties for the liver. Strawberries help increase overall liver function and metabolism and remove fat from the liver.

8\. Coconut and papaya

Coconut contains lauric acid, which is beneficial for the immune system. It contains MCT fat, which turns into ketones. This combination decreases inflammation and scarring on the liver.

## What are the healthy habits that will help me to regulate what I eat?

**Healthy Habits for Regulating Eating**

**Keto and Intermittent Fasting:** The ketogenic diet emphasizes high-fat, low-carb foods to promote fat burning, while intermittent fasting limits eating to specific time windows. Both approaches can help manage cravings and stabilize eating patterns by reducing insulin spikes and promoting stable blood sugar levels.

**Creating a Supportive Environment:** Establish a healthy eating environment by removing tempting snacks, meal-prepping nutritious options, and surrounding yourself with supportive individuals. These steps can simplify maintaining healthy eating habits.

**Fasting Benefits:** Fasting can enhance self-control, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and boost brain function. While not suitable for everyone, it can be a powerful tool for regulating eating habits and supporting overall health.

**Food Logging:** Keeping a detailed food journal helps identify eating patterns and triggers, providing insights for making more intentional food choices and improving dietary habits.

***

## What are the hidden sugars in my food?

**Hidden Sugars in Your Food**

Even foods marketed as healthy can conceal significant amounts of sugar. Here’s a look at some common culprits:

**Granola**

Often considered a health food, granola can contain up to six teaspoons of sugar per 100-gram serving. Opt for varieties with lower added sugars and monitor portion sizes.

**Coconut Water**

Despite its natural image, a typical bottle of coconut water can contain 20 grams of sugar, equivalent to five teaspoons. Enjoy it in moderation and consider plain water as a primary hydration source.

**Yogurt**

Flavored or fruit-added yogurts, like Activia, can contain up to 18 grams of sugar per four ounces. Choose plain yogurt and add fresh fruit to manage sugar intake while enhancing nutrition.

## What are the most nutrient-dense foods that I should consume?

Organ meats are the most nutrient-dense foods - animal liver, brain, hearts, etc.

***

## What are the nutritional benefits through fat addition?

Incorporating healthy fats into your salads enhances both their flavor and nutritional value. Fats, such as those from avocado, nuts, seeds, olives, and cheeses, not only make salads more satisfying but also significantly boost nutrient absorption.

Fats facilitate the extraction of fat-soluble phytonutrients by stimulating bile release, which emulsifies the fats and aids in digestion. This process allows micelles to transport these nutrients across the intestinal wall into the bloodstream, maximizing their absorption.

Thus, adding healthy fats to your salad ensures that you're fully benefiting from its nutritional content.

## What can stop cravings better than Ozempic?

Here’s a list of the best foods to suppress your appetite naturally. These foods contain potent compounds to leave you feeling full and satisfied, and prevent insulin spikes to help stabilize your blood sugar.

1\. Coffee

2\. Avocado

3\. Dark chocolate

4\. Cayenne pepper

5\. Apple cider vinegar

6\. Green tea

7\. Bone broth

8\. Protein-rich meals

9\. Ginger

10\. Dark leafy green vegetables

11\. Olive oil

12\. MCT oil

13\. Turmeric

14\. Zinc

15\. Kombucha tea

16\. Grapefruit

17\. Arugula

18\. Full-fat protein

Eating fatty protein or fat with protein prevents a high insulin spike, which lowers your blood sugar. Avoiding this dip in blood sugar can reduce cravings and curb hunger. Eating fiber also helps buffer the insulin response. Light exercise, like a long walk, is excellent for your blood sugar and can help reduce cravings. An extra 30 minutes of sleep significantly reduces cortisol, stabilizing blood sugar and suppressing appetite naturally. Minimize stress with exercise, physical work, sleep, a healthy diet, and stretching. Ashwagandha is also beneficial, along with magnesium glycinate before bed.

## What chemicals are GRAS (generally recognized as safe) and are they actually safe??

Six chemicals that are generally recognized as safe:

1\. Nitrates: • Help preserve meat • Increase shelf life • Increase the risk of cancer • Could be in your drinking water

2\. BHA: • A preservative • An endocrine disruptor • A carcinogen

3\. BHT: • A preservative • An endocrine disruptor • Toxic to the liver and kidneys • Increases cancer risk

4\. Potassium bromide: • A dough conditioner used in many flour products • A carcinogen • Can inhibit iodine

5\. Brominated vegetable oil: • A flavor stabilizer in beverages • A flame retardant • Can harm the nervous system and brain • Can affect your memory • Can interfere with iodine

6\. Titanium dioxide • Gives candy a smooth texture and brightens colors • Can cause DNA damage • Increases cancer risk • A heavy metal

Our bodies have the ability to get rid of a lot of these poisons if we don’t consume too many. However, some people have a problem with their detoxification genes. This means that they have a lessened ability to get rid of these poisons. The best thing to do is to try to avoid these chemicals and consume foods that support the detoxification process, like cruciferous vegetables.

## What do I need to eat to lose belly fat?

**Ten foods that help you lose belly fat:**

1\. Eggs

2\. Salmon

3\. Cod liver and cod liver oil

4\. Sauerkraut

5\. Cruciferous vegetables

6\. Hamburger

7\. Avocados

8\. Broccoli sprouts

9\. Asparagus

10\. Nutritional yeast (non-fortified)

**Cortisol is a stress hormone that turns protein into sugar. It causes your liver to make new sugar out of non-carbohydrate sources, such as fat, ketones and protein. If your cortisol is really high, your body will make a lot of sugar. This increase in sugar will elevate insulin, and insulin makes belly fat. Consuming a high-carb diet and sugar, or eating too frequently can also cause your insulin to spike, leading to belly fat.** **You'll typically notice belly fat after the liver is already fatty because a lot of the visceral fat around the organs comes from a spill-off of fat from the liver.**

## What foods should I avoid to fall asleep faster?

**Things that can prevent sleep:**

**1. Snacking**

When you snack, you’re triggering insulin, which can lead to insulin resistance. This can cause frequent urination at night and sleep apnea.

**2. Sugar**

Consuming sugar can lead to insulin resistance. It can also deplete your potassium. Potassium relaxes the body.

**3. Protein**

Protein is a stimulant and will wake you up. Make sure you only have a moderate amount of protein with vegetables. Also, make sure you don’t have your protein too late at night.

**4. Coffee and tea**

Coffee and tea contain caffeine, which is a stimulant. One small cup of coffee or tea without sugar is fine.

**5. Alcohol**

Alcohol can dehydrate you, affect your liver, and affect your hormones, which can keep you up at night.

**6. Protein and sugar**

Combining protein and sugar will raise insulin and can lead to insulin resistance, which will prevent sleep.

**7. Drinking excessive amounts of water**

Drink when you’re thirsty. Having lemon juice or apple cider vinegar with your water is more hydrating than water alone.

## What foods should I be eating if I'm over 50 years of age?

Dr. David Sinclair, an expert on longevity, has researched longevity genes called sirtuins. NAD can increase sirtuins! NAD is derived from niacin. It works inside your mitochondria, converting food to energy. As we age, our NAD decreases. Many people take supplements and get injections to boost NAD.

Dr. Abram Hoffer wrote a book about the diseases caused by too little niacin and how many diseases can be cured with mega doses. He’s one of the doctors who started the Orthomolecular Medicine Group, which used high doses of nutrients to create therapeutic dosages.

The following foods can increase NAD and should be part of a healthy diet for people over 50:

1\. Beef liver

2\. Grass-fed red meat

3\. Probiotic-rich foods—raw sauerkraut, yogurt

4\. Parsley (celery or chamomile tea can also work)

5\. Curcumin—turmeric

6\. Quercetin—onions

7\. Omega-3 fatty acids—wild-caught fatty fish, cod liver

Sulforaphane, found in cruciferous vegetables, is also beneficial for healthy aging. Broccoli sprouts and radish sprouts are great to add to salads! Anthocyanins, found in blue and purple foods like blueberries, blackberries, and purple cabbage, are also good for anti-aging.

## What foods should I eat for nails and hair?

If you want really nice healthy hair, healthy skin, and healthy nails, then you would want to consume healthy fats like avocado and eggs with the yolks. Not use them topically.

Avocados are loaded with carotenoids. Carotenoids are a fat-soluble phytonutrient. Because there is a good amount of fats in avocados, you’re going to absorb these phytonutrients much better. If you combine avocado and eggs, you will have even better absorption. Consuming eggs and avocados on the keto diet, while also doing intermittent fasting, can result in really nice hair, nails, and skin.

**Avocado benefits for hair, skin, and nails:**

• Active vitamin A

• B5

• B6

• Copper

• Folate

• Vitamin K

• Magnesium

• Biotin

• Vitamin E

• Vitamin C

• Antioxidant properties

• Anti-inflammatory properties

• Monosaturated fats

• Oleic acid — 68%

**Egg benefits for hair, skin, and nails:**

## What ingredients are considered toxic and I shouldn't consume them?

With just one scan, you’ll see the percentage of sugar, starch, and seed oils lurking in your food. These are the 3 deadly ingredients in ultra-processed junk foods—and my app helps you quickly identify and avoid them.

You'll be surprised at how many “healthy” foods are actually loaded with these harmful ingredients! Don’t be fooled by "zero sugar" labels. Starch is basically hidden sugar, and it’s just as harmful to your body. Most junk foods are packed with toxic ingredients like rancid seed oils, processed starches, and artificial chemicals—yet they lack the essential nutrients your body craves.

Did you know the average person consumes over 100 pounds of modified food starches every year? it’s in everything from baby formula to pet food—and it's a huge part of a teenager’s diet. It's time to take control and make smarter food choices! Junk foods are “dead” foods. They’ve been stripped of vital vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals—and loaded with preservatives, coloring, and MSG. That’s not food; that’s just a bunch of chemicals your body doesn’t know what to do with.

## What is a good alternative to cheese if I’m allergic to dairy?

You could either be sensitive to the lactose, the milk, sugar which is probably not the problem. It could be the casein in there. But you may be allergic. Get a test but let's say you're not allergic and you're still reacting.

The type of the cheese matters. For example, if you get European cheese that is usually raw. You can get real raw European cheese and you probably get in America. You have to search it out.

## What is better pasture raised eggs or store bought eggs?

#### **Why Free-Range Eggs Are Healthier Than Commercial Chicken Eggs**

**1. Diet and Nutrient Content:**

* **Commercial Chicken Diet**: Commercial chickens are typically fed a grain-based diet supplemented with vitamins and minerals. While this diet helps produce large eggs, it lacks critical nutrients found in the natural diet of free-range chickens, such as insects and green vegetation.
* **Free-Range Chicken Diet**: Free-range chickens have some access to the outdoors, allowing them to consume a more varied diet that includes insects, worms, and vegetation. This natural diet contributes to the higher nutrient content in their eggs.

**2. Nutritional Differences:**

* **Omega-3 vs. Omega-6 Fatty Acids**: Free-range eggs generally have a better balance of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-3s are anti-inflammatory and important for heart and brain health, while too many omega-6s can contribute to inflammation.
* **Vitamins and Antioxidants**: Free-range eggs contain higher levels of vitamins and antioxidants. For example, they have double the amount of vitamin E and 38% more vitamin A compared to commercial eggs. These nutrients are essential for overall health, including eye, prostate, and heart health.

**3. Living Conditions:**

* **Commercial Chickens**: These chickens are often kept in confined spaces with limited movement, which can impact their overall health and the quality of the eggs they produce.
* **Free-Range Chickens**: Although the term "free-range" can be somewhat misleading, as it only requires "access" to the outdoors, these chickens generally have more space to move around compared to commercial chickens. This can lead to healthier chickens and better-quality eggs.

Free-range eggs are considered healthier than commercial eggs due to the more varied and natural diet of free-range chickens, which leads to higher nutrient content in the eggs. Additionally, the living conditions of free-range chickens are generally better, contributing to the overall quality of the eggs.

## What is Bill Gates Apeel?

Bill Gates’ new product, Apeel, is used to make fresh produce last longer. Of the ingredients in Apeel, 99.34 percent are listed as “other ingredients,” which is a red flag because of the lack of transparency. We know that Apeel contains monoglycerides and diglycerides—emulsifiers, which help mix things together. Apeel also contains solvents and heavy metals, including palladium, cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic! Manufacturers claim these metals are safe in small amounts, but there is no data about chronic consumption over time. Apeel also contains polyethylene glycol, a compound found in antifreeze.

Apeel could be a partially hydrogenated product. The FDA has banned trans fats, but loopholes still allow manufacturers to use them in their products. If a product has less than .5 grams of trans fats, the FDA allows them to round it down to zero and not report the trans fats in the product. If a product is classified as an emulsifier, not a lipid or fat, it is exempt from the FDA’s ban on trans fats.

There is some controversy surrounding the function of the Apeel coating on produce. Is it a coating to keep food fresh or a fungicide? The EPA and the OMRI describe Apeel as a fungicide used after harvest, but Apeel is advertised as a protective coating. There’s no way to remove the Apeel coating from your fresh produce, so it could potentially lock pesticides or pathogens inside. Think twice about buying fruits and vegetables that have this coating on them.

## What is Dr. Berg's opinion on dairy?

Dr. Berg has reservations about dairy, particularly due to the protein casein, which may have growth-promoting properties, especially if sourced from cows potentially treated with hormones. Similarly, whey protein, popular among bodybuilders, also has growth-promoting effects that could be a concern. However, Dr. Berg suggests that consuming moderate amounts of high-quality dairy, such as cheese from healthy, pasture-raised cows, can be acceptable. The key is to choose dairy from trusted sources and consume it in moderation.

## What is GRAS?

GRAS (generally recognized as safe). GRAS applies to chemicals that are in our environment and food. GRAS implies that the chemical is regulated and has been through a lot of safety studies. However, the FDA allows companies to self-certify their chemicals as safe. There are about 10,000 chemicals in our food supply, and 99% of them have not been reviewed for safety. GRAS is more of a loophole that companies use to imply that their chemicals are safe despite outside testing.

## What is happening with egg prices?

Dr. Baker points out the similarities between the current bird flu outbreak and the COVID-19 outbreak of 2020. The media creates fear, followed by a pandemic, to gain control. This eventually leads to civil rights violations, including lockdowns and work bans.

Next, people are coerced into taking profitable yet toxic vaccines as a countermeasure against the outbreak. We are witnessing this once again with the current bird flu outbreak. There are two labs in the US: the Southeast Poultry Research Lab, funded by the USDA, and the University of Wisconsin Veterinary School, which conducts gain-of-function research on viruses. This involves manipulating a naturally occurring virus to make it more deadly and able to jump from species to species.

Farmers are encouraged to perform PCR tests on their flocks, which are known for false positives. If any of their birds test positive for bird flu, they are paid to slaughter their entire flock. The increase in egg prices is not due to bird deaths from bird flu but rather the mass slaughter of birds. Over 1.25 billion taxpayer dollars have been used to fund this mass slaughter. Ultimately, the goal is to mass vaccinate chickens in the food supply against bird flu.

Gain-of-function research is dangerous and must stop! We can also help combat this problem by purchasing eggs from smaller farmers at farmer’s markets.

## What is solanine?

**Solanine: Understanding Its Role and Impact**

Solanine is a natural compound found in nightshade vegetables, such as potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplants. It acts as a plant defense mechanism against pests and is primarily concentrated in the leaves and stems, with trace amounts in the edible parts.

**Impact on Arthritis:** Some individuals with arthritis report that nightshades exacerbate their symptoms, possibly due to solanine's potential to trigger inflammation. While research is limited, solanine might aggravate symptoms in those with specific sensitivities or allergies.

**Identifying Sensitivities:** To determine if solanine affects your arthritis, maintain a food diary and note any changes in symptoms. You might also consider eliminating nightshades from your diet temporarily, then reintroducing them to observe any differences. Although sensitivities are rare, they may contribute to increased joint pain or inflammation in some individuals.

***

## What is stevia?

**Understanding Stevia: A Natural Sweetener**

Stevia, derived from the leaves of the _Stevia rebaudiana_ plant, is a natural sweetener known for its remarkable sweetness—up to 300 times sweeter than sugar. Used for centuries in South America, it is now a popular sugar substitute in various forms, including liquid, packets, and granulated blends.

**Impact on Blood Sugar**

Stevia has minimal impact on blood sugar levels. Unlike regular sugar, which causes rapid glucose spikes, stevia’s compounds, steviol glycosides, are not metabolized by the body. Instead, they pass through the digestive system unabsorbed, making stevia a suitable option for individuals with diabetes and those on low-carb diets.

## What is the #1 food I should avoid if I want to have a healthy liver?

It’s a myth that liver damage is permanent. The liver is one of the only organs that can regenerate itself 100%. Another myth is that the liver is filled with toxins. The liver detoxifies poisons, it doesn't store them. **The worst “food” or ingredient for your liver is seed oils.** **Seed oils are damaging, inflammatory, and high in omega-6 fats, specifically linoleic acid. Lard contains about 2.5% linoleic acid, and tallow only contains 0.7%. Corn oil contains 56.6% linoleic acid!**

**Seed oils contain oxidized linoleic acid that can cause significant oxidative damage in the body, especially in the liver and the nervous system.** The average diet is 25 to 30% seed oils, which is too much. Seed oils become lodged in our fat cells and the membranes surrounding the nervous system and can remain there for 2 to 3 years. Seed oils can’t be used for energy. They inflame the liver and contribute to insulin resistance. You should avoid seed oils, including canola oil, soy oil, and cottonseed oil, which are commonly labeled as vegetable oil.

Always check food labels and avoid seed oils and foods that contain them. Replace seed oils with oils high in omega-3 fatty acids rather than omega-6. Reduce your consumption of grain-fed animal products and look for grass-fed meats.

## What is the anabolic power of eggs?

Eggs are a premier protein source, excelling in muscle growth and tissue development. Their protein is highly digestible and effective for muscle protein synthesis, surpassing other protein sources in anabolic potential.

Comparative Anabolic Effects:

\- Eggs: 48% anabolic effect

\- Meat, Fish, Poultry: 32% anabolic effect

\- Egg Whites: 17% anabolic effect

\- Soy and Dairy/Whey: 17% and 16% anabolic effect, respectively

\- Spirulina: 6% anabolic effect

Eggs offer superior muscle-building benefits, with whole eggs being far more effective than just the whites.

## What is the best food for me to eat to get calcium?

Cheese is the food highest in calcium. In particular, Parmesan cheese. You can also get calcium from leafy greens, nuts and seeds.

***

## What is the best source of COQ10?

Foods high in coenzyme Q10:

1\. Heart muscle

2\. Organ meats

3\. Fatty fish

4\. Extra virgin olive oil

Exercise indirectly increases the amount of CoQ10 your body makes. You can also get CoQ10 from supplements.

## What is the biggest danger of prolonged fasting?

Prolonged fasting is very beneficial to support a healthy body. However, there is one aspect of prolonged fasting that can be dangerous, and that’s what we’re going to cover today. Prolonged fasting is when you fast for three or more days. The biggest danger of prolonged fasting is called refeeding syndrome. This can happen if a person consumes too much of the wrong foods too fast after coming off of a prolonged fast.

However, the risk of refeeding syndrome is low if you aren’t malnourished going into a prolonged fast. As a bare minimum, when you start any type of fasting, you need to take electrolytes and B vitamins.

## What is the deadliest sugar in the world?

There are many different types of sugar, but the most common types of sugar are made up of glucose and fructose. Every cell in the body can metabolize glucose. But only the liver can break down fructose.

Fructose doesn’t initially trigger insulin or increase blood sugar. However, fructose can lead to a fatty liver, inflammation, scar tissue, and damage to other parts of the body. As the liver becomes fatty, you could also develop insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and high uric acid levels. Uric acid is behind gout, certain types of kidney stones, and damage to the arteries. The body actually deals with fructose the same as it would with alcohol. Even though fructose is low on the glycemic index, it’s very deadly. Many types of sugar, like table sugar, honey, beet sugar, and high fructose corn syrup, are 50 percent glucose and 50 percent fructose. But agave nectar is 85 percent fructose. This makes agave nectar the worst type of sugar you could consume.

## What is the difference between Real Food Vs. Processed Foods?

**Don't Be Fooled by Nutrition Labels!**

Product labels can be misleading. Let's look at two examples:

* **Product A:** 29 grams total fat, 4 grams saturated fat, 17 grams carbohydrates, 1 gram sugar.
* **Product B:** 8 grams total fat, 1 gram saturated fat, 16 grams carbohydrates, 0 grams sugar.

Based on numbers alone, you might think Product B is healthier. But here's the surprise:

* **Product A is an avocado** – a natural, whole food packed with healthy fats, vitamins, and fiber.
* **Product B is Doritos** – a highly processed snack with unhealthy ingredients like corn, vegetable oil, maltodextrin, MSG, and more.

**The Key Takeaway:** Nutrition labels tell only part of the story. To truly determine a food's healthfulness, you must examine the ingredients list.

**Real Food vs. Processed Products**

Real food nourishes your body. Ultra-processed products are often loaded with harmful ingredients and offer little nutritional value. They're a major contributor to disease and poor health.

**Focus on Ingredients, Not Numbers**

If you want to identify healthy foods, skip the nutrition facts and go straight to the ingredients. Here are 3 major red flags to look out for:

1. **Seed oils:** Highly inflammatory and damaging to your health.
2. **All forms of sugar:** Spikes blood sugar and contributes to numerous health issues.
3. **Starches:** Break down into sugar in the body, leading to the same problems as added sugar.

Choose whole, unprocessed foods for true nourishment and optimal health!

## What is the downside of allulose?

Though it’s generally well tolerated, consuming large amounts of allulose can lead to gastrointestinal issues such as bloating, gas, and discomfort.

***

## What is the downside of erythritol?

Erythritol can irritate the gastrointestinal tract when consumed in excessive amounts. Additionally, erythritol has a noticeable cooling effect, which may be off-putting or unsuitable for recipes that require a lot of sugar.

## What is the first sign that my kid is eating too much sugar?

**The number one sign that your child is eating too much sugar is moodiness.** Changes with their mood like grouchiness, irritability, and whining may be happening because they're consuming too much sugar.

**Popular foods for kids that have hidden sugar:**

• Orange juice

• Apple sauce

• Fruit juice

• Fruit snacks

• Granola bars

• Vitamin water

• Mac' n' cheese

Moodiness can be the first symptom, because what happens is the blood sugars go up, insulin kicks in and pushes the blood sugars down, and now they have low blood sugar. Moodiness is a symptom of low blood sugar.

1. **Sugar**, in general, interferes with different parts of the brain and the production of certain neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. These neurotransmitters calm the nervous system.
2. **Sugar** blocks the absorption of vitamin C. In the presence of sugar, the body can't absorb vitamin C. Vitamin C is necessary to make neurotransmitters.
3. **Sugar** also depletes zinc, vitamin B1, potassium, and magnesium. All of these are key minerals and vitamins that help calm a child down.

**When a child is consuming too much sugar, they could:**

• Be hyperactive

• Have attention deficit problems

• Have a difficult time learning, studying, and retaining information

## What is the food that creates liver problems?

Liver problems often go unnoticed, but subtle signs like right shoulder blade pain or discomfort under the right rib cage can be indicators. Contrary to popular belief, liver damage isn't always permanent. This incredible organ has the unique ability to fully regenerate itself. Another misconception is that the liver stores toxins. Its role is to filter and neutralize them, not hoard them.

A major culprit for liver damage isn't a "food" at all, but rather seed oils. These oils are rife with inflammatory omega-6 fats, particularly linoleic acid. In contrast, animal fats like lard and tallow have significantly lower amounts. Seed oils contain oxidized linoleic acid, a substance that can cause serious harm to the liver and nervous system.

Unfortunately, seed oils make up a whopping 25-30% of the average diet. These oils get trapped in our fat cells and nervous system membranes, lingering for years. They can't even be used for energy! Instead, they contribute to liver inflammation and insulin resistance. Steer clear of seed oils, including common ones like canola, soy, and cottonseed, often masquerading as "vegetable oil".

Make it a habit to read food labels carefully and avoid any product containing seed oils. Swap them out for oils rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and opt for grass-fed meats over grain-fed. These small changes can make a world of difference for your liver health.

## What is the most important factor in building muscle?

We often think that increasing protein helps build muscle because muscle is made of protein. But this doesn’t always work. Some people that eat more protein may even suffer from amino acid deficiency. You need sufficient amounts of protein to build muscle, but, more importantly, you need sufficient amino acids. The general thought is that you need .8 grams of protein per kilogram of lean body mass—not overall weight. This might look like around 50 grams of protein per day. A moderate amount of protein would be between 1.2 and 1.7 grams per kilogram of lean body mass. High protein would be about 2 grams per kilogram of lean body mass. It’s essential to focus on consuming quality protein from eggs, meat, fish, and dairy. It’s not ideal to rely on getting your protein from plant sources or protein powder to build healthy muscles.

## What is the most inflammatory food in the world?

There is a lot of debate over what the most inflammatory food is. Some people say meat, while others say it's the fiber in plants. Some people do well consuming fiber, and others don’t. Why? Humans can’t digest fiber. Your microbes are what break down fiber by fermenting it.

While fiber is anti-inflammatory, unfermented fiber is inflammatory. If you don’t have enough of the right microbes in your gut, you could have more of an issue with fiber than other people. Certain things like antibiotics, improper nutrition as a child, ultra-processed foods, and glyphosate can alter your microbiome and lead to inflammation.

The most inflammatory foods in the world are ultra-processed foods: a basic recipe of sugar, flour, and seed oils with a dash of glyphosate.

## What is the role of carbohydrates in cholesterol production?

While it’s true that excessive saturated fat intake can elevate cholesterol levels, it’s equally important to recognize the significant role carbohydrates—especially sugars, bread, and pasta—play in fat and cholesterol production.

**Understanding De Novo Lipogenesis:**

\- **Carbohydrate Conversion:** When consumed in excess, carbohydrates are converted into fatty acids through a process called de novo lipogenesis. These fatty acids are stored as triglycerides and can increase LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels, contributing to plaque buildup in the arteries and raising the risk of heart disease.

**Impact of Processed Carbohydrates:**

\- **Insulin Resistance:** Processed carbohydrates, like those in white bread, pasta, and sugary snacks, cause rapid blood sugar spikes. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance, a precursor to type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

\- **Cholesterol Production:** The liver converts excess glucose into very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), which eventually becomes LDL cholesterol, further contributing to arterial plaque and cardiovascular risk.

By moderating carbohydrate intake, particularly processed carbs, you can better manage cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.

***

## What is the role of diet plans?

Adopting a specific diet plan can be a powerful tool in managing your child's sugar intake and improving their overall health and behavior. The **Healthy Keto diet**, which emphasizes whole, nutrient-dense foods while limiting sugar and processed carbohydrates, is one such plan. By focusing on healthy fats, proteins, and non-starchy vegetables, this diet can help stabilize blood sugar levels, reduce inflammation, and enhance brain function.

Many parents have observed significant improvements in their children's focus, calmness, and self-control after implementing the Healthy Keto diet. If your child struggles with mood issues related to high sugar intake, it’s advisable to check their blood sugar levels and consult with a healthcare professional to determine if this diet may be suitable.

**Managing Sugar-Related Mood Swings:**

Excessive sugar consumption is often linked to mood swings, irritability, and hyperactivity in children. Reducing sugar intake and incorporating healthier options can promote more stable moods.

For example, try a **keto pancakes recipe** as a nutritious and satisfying alternative to traditional high-sugar breakfast choices. By integrating such healthy options, you can support your child's mood stability and overall well-being.

## What is the worst food for heart health?

Seed oils, such as vegetable oil, are industrial products processed multiple times and devoid of nutritional value. They are primarily composed of unstable polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), prone to oxidation and linked to numerous health risks. Consumption of seed oils contributes to inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and increased risk of heart disease and metabolic syndrome. Common in processed foods and cooking oils, they should be replaced with stable fats like butter, olive oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, and lard to maintain a healthier omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid balance.

***

## What is the worst protein in the world?

Ater having a horrible reaction to some “chicken wings” that I ate, I called to find out what was in them. It turns out they were plant-based chicken wings made with textured vegetable protein.

**Textured vegetable protein, or textured soy protein, is the worst protein in the world. Soy or cottonseed is used as the “vegetable” to make this protein.**

**Textured vegetable protein was invented in 1960 as a way to use the waste produced from seed oils. It has been used in veggie burgers, fake meat products, cereals, and many other food products. Textured vegetable protein is an ultra-processed ingredient. To make it, oil, nutrients, and fiber are removed from the soybean using heat and chemicals like hexane. There are no long-term safety studies or upper limit on hexane established by the FDA. Chronic hexane toxicity is a condition caused by inhaling hexane, so what happens when you ingest it?**

Over 95% of textured vegetable protein is GMO, and when consumed, it robs nutrients from your liver. It’s very similar to soy protein isolates. Any time you consume pure protein without fat, you are creating stress in your body, especially if the protein doesn't contain key nutrients like fat-soluble vitamins A, E, D, and K.

## What kind of beverages are most likely to cause dehydration?

Some of the most dehydrating drinks include sodas, fruit juices, sugar-sweetened drinks, caffeinated beverages, alcohol, and sports drinks.

***

## What kind of beverages can help me battle dehydration providing a normal DV of electrolytes?

The best drink to avoid dehydration is electrolyte-enriched water. Electrolytes play a crucial role in facilitating fluid absorption into the body, and electrolyte imbalance can cause dehydration despite drinking plenty of fluids.

However, it’s best to avoid pre-mixed electrolyte sports drinks with added sugar and instead use a sugar-free electrolyte powder to replenish electrolytes and avoid dehydration.

## What kind of diet would you recommend if I have psoriasis?

For managing psoriasis, focus on:

1\. **L-Glutamine**: Strengthens the gut lining and supports gut health. Start with 1 gram daily, gradually increasing to 10 grams split into three doses on an empty stomach.

2\. **Tamanu oil**: Apply topically for its antibacterial and skin-healing properties.

3\. **Vitamin D3 and K2**: Take 10,000 IU of D3 and 100 mcg of K2 (MK7) daily to support immune function and skin health.

Avoid inflammatory vegetable oils and consider adopting a healthy keto diet with intermittent fasting to reduce inflammation and support your immune system. Periodic prolonged fasting may also help alleviate symptoms over time.

### **Constructing a Low-Carb Meal Plan**

A typical low-carb meal plan for diabetics should focus on nutrient-dense, whole foods that provide sustained energy and help stabilize blood sugar levels. Here's an example of what a day's worth of meals might look like:

* **Breakfast:** Spinach and feta omelet with sliced avocado
* **Lunch:** Grilled chicken salad with mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, and a olive oil-based dressing
* **Dinner:** Baked salmon with roasted Brussels sprouts and a side of cauliflower rice
* **Snacks:** Hard-boiled eggs, celery sticks with almond butter, or a handful of macadamia nuts

Want to stay full and focused from dawn to dusk? Build your meals around protein powerhouses, good-for-you fats, and a rainbow of non-starchy vegetables. Your taste buds (and waistline) will thank you.

### **Superfoods for Diabetics on a Low-Carb Diet**

Constructing a well-balanced low-carb diet is a great start, but why not take it to the next level? Superfoods are like the secret weapon in your healthy eating arsenal.

Diabetics, listen up: incorporating these nutritional powerhouses can give you an extra boost of vitamins, minerals, and all that good stuff your body craves.

* **Leafy greens:** Spinach, kale, and collard greens are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber, making them excellent choices for blood sugar control.
* **Berries:** Low in carbs and high in antioxidants, berries like raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries can satisfy your sweet tooth without spiking your blood sugar.
* **Nuts and seeds:** Almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds provide healthy fats, protein, and fiber, helping to keep you feeling full and stabilize blood sugar levels.
* **Fatty fish:** Salmon, sardines, and mackerel are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity.

By incorporating these nutrient-dense foods into your low-carb meal plan, you'll be well on your way to optimizing your diabetes management and overall health.

Remember, the key is to find an approach that works for you, one that you can sustain long-term and that leaves you feeling your best.

## What type of wheat is acceptable to consume?

Typical wheat products like bread and pasta are made with the seed, or grain, of the wheat plant. Wheatgrass is the actual plant that the seed grows on. The type of wheatgrass used in wheatgrass juice is at an early stage—usually less than ten days old. I think how healthy wheatgrass is for you depends on what it’s grown on. Wheatgrass grown on soil may be more beneficial than wheatgrass grown in other ways.

**Wheatgrass juice powder may also be more beneficial than wheatgrass powder products. Wheatgrass juice powder is more concentrated because it doesn’t contain any fiber.** One of the advantages of wheatgrass juice powder over wheatgrass powder is that people can consume it even if they can’t consume fiber. Unlike grain, wheatgrass is gluten-free and is low in anti-nutrients, tannins, and oxalates. Wheatgrass juice powder grown on good soil is low-carb and rich in vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, and amino acids.

**However, I consume wheatgrass juice powder for two main reasons:**

1\. 70% of wheatgrass is chlorophyll

2\. It’s rich in phytonutrients

Both chlorophyll and phytonutrients have a wealth of beneficial properties. Research is also being done on using wheatgrass for a genetic type of anemia called thalassemia. Growing your own wheatgrass to make wheatgrass juice is inexpensive and pretty simple. Give it a try!

## What vegetables can you eat if you are on warfarin?

People taking warfarin can safely consume low-vitamin K vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers, artichokes, zucchini, celery, red cabbage, okra, red pepper, turnips, beets, onions, and eggplant. Other options include mushrooms and cauliflower.

***

## What vegetables or foods cause bloating?

Reason why the person could actually feel more nauseous, bloated, and irritable when they consume certain vegetables. It is because of something called lectins, a natural insecticide that the plant has to protect against insects and pests.

A certain percentage of the population is sensitive to lectins so when they consume lectins in certain foods, they would get more inflammation, bloating, nausea, etc.

**Veggies High in Lectins:**

• Kidney Bean

• Tomato

• Cucumber

• Peas

• Green Beans

• Chick Pea

• Soy

• Tofu

• Zucchini

• Nigh Shade (Pepper, Eggplant, Potato, Tomato)

**Veggies Low in Lectins:**

• Cruciferous – Arugula, kale, Brussels sprouts, cabbage

• Celery

• Carrot

• Onion

• Beet

• Asparagus

• Garlic

• Leafy Green

• Romaine

• Spinach

• Parsley

• Sea Weed

• Mushroom

## What vitamins and minerals are in eggs?

Eggs contain all of the fat-soluble vitamins and contain minerals like selenium, phosphorus, calcium, and potassium. They also contain small amounts of iron.

***

## What's healthier chicken or pork?

Typically, commercial chicken and pork from a grocery store are highly processed. I never recommend consuming that type of meat.

**Problems with processed meat:**

• It’s factory farmed

• The animals consume GMO grains

• The animals are given antibiotics

• The animals are given drugs that are arsenic-based

• The animals are given formaldehyde

Personally, I prefer pork because it’s fattier meat. If you have chicken with skin, the skin does provide some fattiness. Just remember that if you’re on the ketogenic diet, you want more fat in your diet. Lean meats stimulate insulin levels more than fatty meats. Pork would be better on your insulin levels.

## What's the biggest lie about food?

### Understanding Cholesterol: Friend or Foe?

Cholesterol gets a bad rap, but it actually plays a vital role in our bodies. Made by the liver, it's used to build healthy cell walls, hormones, and even vitamin D.

**Fats 101:**

Fats come in two main categories: saturated and unsaturated. Saturated fats, like those in coconut oil (87%) and lard (47%), are solid at room temperature. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, are liquid (think olive oil).

**The Cholesterol Myth:**

Dietary cholesterol from foods like steak doesn't have a huge impact on your overall cholesterol levels. Here's the surprising truth: your body actually makes about 80% of the cholesterol you need. It's a smart system – if you eat more cholesterol, your body naturally produces less. The opposite is true too – if you consume less, your body ramps up production.

**The Real Culprits:**

So, what should you really be mindful of? Here's where the plot twist comes in. While cholesterol itself isn't inherently bad, it's the company it keeps that matters. Sugar, smoking, trans fats, and seed oils can create an unhealthy environment for cholesterol, potentially increasing your risk of heart problems.

## What's the difference between sea kelp and sea weed?

### **Sea Kelp vs. Seaweed**

If you're interested in health, nutrition, weight loss, the ketogenic diet, and intermittent fasting, then you may have heard of [sea kelp and seaweed](https://www.drberg.com/blog/kelp-vs-seaweed-whats-the-difference).

While they may seem interchangeable for marine plants that grow in nutrient-rich saltwater environments, there are some key differences between these two natural food sources.

Sea kelp is a brown algae growing along rocky coastlines worldwide. It's known for its high nutrient profile and has been used as a traditional medicine in many cultures throughout history.

In addition to being rich in vitamins A, C, D, and E, as well as minerals such as iodine and iron, it also contains fucoidan, which has potentially anti-inflammatory properties.

"Seaweed" refers to any marine plant or algae that grows in saltwater environments. This includes red algae (such as nori), green algae (such as sea lettuce), and brown algae (such as bladderwrack).

Like sea kelp, seaweeds contain nutrients, including vitamins B12 and C, calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron, and copper - making them one of nature's most nutrient-dense foods.

#### **Differences Between Sea Kelp And Seaweed**

**Taste:** Sea kelp tends to have a milder flavor than other types of seaweeds, which can be pretty salty or bitter, depending on the variety.

**Nutrient profile:** While sea kelp and seaweed offer similar nutritional benefits, their specific vitamin/mineral content will vary based on species/variety.

**Uses:** Sea kelp is often used in supplements or added to foods as a natural source of iodine. Seaweeds are more commonly consumed whole, fresh, or dried and can be used in various dishes such as soups, salads, sushi rolls, etc.

While sea kelp and seaweed may like the same thing, they have distinct differences that set them apart. However, both offer an impressive nutrient profile, making them excellent additions to any healthy diet.

#### **Rich in Trace Minerals**

One of the most well-known benefits of sea kelp is its high [iodine](https://www.drberg.com/blog/8-unexpected-benefits-of-iodine-must-watch) content, which plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy thyroid function.

In addition to iodine, sea kelp contains other essential trace minerals such as selenium and zinc. These minerals are vital for various bodily functions, including [immune system support](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-keto-protects-your-immune-system), antioxidant activity, and DNA synthesis.

## What's the optimum vegetable daily intake?

Eating enough vegetables and salads daily is crucial for meeting your nutritional needs and maintaining optimal health. But how much is enough? And what role do veggies play in nourishing our bodies?

As a nutrition expert, I've seen firsthand the incredible benefits of incorporating various vegetables into your daily diet. These nutrient-dense foods, from [leafy greens](https://www.drberg.com/blog/blood-thinners-and-leafy-green-vegetables) to colorful bell peppers, are the unsung heroes of a healthy lifestyle.

#### **The Role of Vegetables in Nourishment**

Vegetables are nature's multivitamins, packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that keep our bodies functioning at their best. They're rich in fiber, which aids in digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut microbiome.

Eating various vegetables ensures you get a broad spectrum of nutrients, each vital in maintaining overall health. For example, leafy greens like spinach and [kale](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-i-love-kale) are excellent sources of vitamin K, which supports [bone health](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-ways-to-improve-bone-health) and proper blood clotting.

#### **How Much Is Enough?**

The recommended daily amount of salad or vegetables is about 7 to 10 cups, with one cup of salad equivalent to one ounce. This may seem like a lot, but it's achievable when you make veggies the star of your meals and snacks.

Aim to fill half your plate with vegetables at each meal and incorporate them into snacks like carrot sticks with hummus or celery with nut butter. By prioritizing vegetables, you'll quickly reach your daily quota and reap the numerous health benefits they provide.

## What's the worst ingredient in the world?

This section explores the research of Dr. Chris Knobbe, an ophthalmologist who has studied seed oils and their potential connection to health problems.

**The Shift from Fat to Seed Oils:**

While sugar intake remained relatively stable between 1922 and 1987, obesity rates skyrocketed by 600%. During this same period, vegetable oil consumption soared from 78 to 497 calories per person per day. Today, the average American gets roughly a third of their daily calories from seed oils.

**Seed Oils and Metabolic Issues:**

Dr. Knobbe's research suggests that seed oils might contribute to diabetes by hindering the body's ability to burn fuel efficiently due to mitochondrial dysfunction.

Seed oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids, which can accumulate in fat tissue, cell membranes, and mitochondria. These polyunsaturated fats may promote oxidation and inflammation within the body. Additionally, seed oils might lack essential nutrients, forcing the body to use its reserves, leading to deficiencies.

**From Industrial Uses to Our Plates:**

Interestingly, cottonseed oil, the first widely used seed oil, was originally intended for industrial applications like machinery and lamps. Its introduction into food aimed to replace butter and lard, which ultimately proved successful from a commercial standpoint. By 2010, seed oil consumption in the US had reached a staggering 80 grams per person daily.

**Reducing Seed Oil Intake:**

The simplest way to minimize seed oil consumption is to limit processed foods and focus on whole, unprocessed options like meat, eggs, dairy, and fresh produce. These foods naturally contain a variety of essential nutrients.

While Dr. Knobbe's research raises interesting questions, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized dietary advice.

## Which is better, erythritol or allulose?

Whether erythritol or allulose is better depends on the desired use. Erythritol has a stronger taste and cooling effect that can quickly overpower a sugary recipe. However, it’s a great sweetener for tea and coffee. Allulose is generally recommended for baking as it melts and caramelizes similarly to sugar and can be used at a one-to-one ratio in most recipes.

## Which is healthier: Juice or Soda?

While fruit juice seems like a healthy choice due to its natural origin, it's surprisingly similar to soda in sugar content. A 12-ounce serving of juice often packs more sugar than the same amount of soda!

Juice production strips away the beneficial fiber and oils found in whole fruit, leaving behind a highly refined product. Artificial flavors are often added, and the pasteurization process destroys valuable nutrients and beneficial microbes.

Non-organic juices may also contain pesticide residues. Moreover, the high sugar content in juice, without the accompanying vitamins and minerals, forces your body to deplete its nutrient stores.

Even popular apple juice is often made from concentrate, stored for long periods, and shipped globally before being reconstituted.

In the end, both soda and juice are unhealthy choices. If you're craving juice, opt for the whole fruit instead.

A better alternative is a fruit smoothie, which retains live enzymes, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants without pasteurization. For a soda fix, consider sugar-free options like Zevia, or simply enjoy refreshing water with electrolytes.

## Why can I not quit chocolate?

Chocolate contains over 380 chemicals, with three main ones creating pleasure sensations:

1\. **Phenylalanine**: Builds dopamine, enhancing mood, and producing endorphins for euphoria. Also increases noradrenaline for alertness.

2\. **Theobromine**: Similar to caffeine, it boosts mental clarity, acts as a diuretic and vasodilator. Not ideal if you have liver issues as it may disrupt sleep due to slower clearance.

3\. **Tryptophan**: Precursor to serotonin, promoting calmness, reducing stress, and lifting mood. Often consumed when feeling down.

Enjoy chocolate in moderation, preferably sugar-free with sweeteners like erythritol, stevia, or monk fruit. Avoid consuming it late in the day to prevent sleep disturbances.

## Why do I feel sleepy after eating salads?

### **Post-Meal Fatigue from Salads**

**Feeling tired after a salad? Here's why:**

Gut Bacteria and Fiber:

\- Salads are high in fiber.

\- Gut bacteria ferment fiber, producing short-chain fatty acids.

\- This process can signal the brain to slow down, causing fatigue.

\- Too much fiber too quickly can overwhelm your digestive system, leading to bloating and tiredness.

**Misconceptions:**

\- Potassium: Essential for health, not likely to cause drowsiness in salad amounts.

\- Hidden Sugars: Usually not enough in salads to cause an energy crash.

**Main Point:**

\- High fiber in salads can lead to post-meal fatigue due to digestion.

## Why does canola oil have a bad reputation?

Canola oil's bad reputation stems from potential health risks associated with erucic acid, trans fats formation during production, and omega-3 degradation.

Moreover, memory function impairment has been linked to canola consumption, and hexane extraction raises environmental concerns.

## Why does protein help with low blood sugar?

With hypoglycemia, insulin lowers high blood sugar, often too much, resulting in low blood sugar. This happens because people with hypoglycemia have high insulin levels and lack counteracting hormones. While glucose, fat, and ketones are common fuels, protein can also be converted into glucose via gluconeogenesis, providing energy and helping stabilize blood sugar.

Consuming protein helps balance blood sugar by stimulating both insulin and glucagon, unlike carbohydrates, which can cause a temporary spike followed by a drop. We recommend adopting a Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting for those with hypoglycemia.

## Why is cholesterol important?

People are afraid of cholesterol. But, your body actually makes 3000mg of cholesterol per day. If cholesterol is dangerous, why would the body make so much of it?

**Why cholesterol is important:**

• You need cholesterol to make bile

• You need cholesterol to make vitamin D

• You need cholesterol to make hormones (estrogen, testosterone, cortisol)

• Your brain is made up of 50% fat and 50% cholesterol

• Your brain synapses are lined with cholesterol

• The myelin sheath that surrounds the nerves needs cholesterol

• 40% of the cholesterol that’s made in your body is needed for the cellular membrane

**Your cell membranes are dynamic and are there to protect you. The cell membranes have to do with:**

• Receptors

• Ion channels

• Transporters

• Pumps—ions

• Fat-soluble vitamins

• Hormones

• Signaling

## Why is dietary fat important?

There are several reasons why you need dietary fat for a keto diet.

* Fat helps you fast longer (lowers hunger and cravings)
* Fat supplies you with nutrients (essential fats and fat-soluble vitamins)
* Fat stimulates bile
* Fat triggers healthy hormones
* Fat supplies your body with healthy tissue
* Fat slows the absorption of protein
* Fat helps you maintain your weight

The truth is, you don’t necessarily need to consume more fat on keto. Most of all, you need to lower your carbohydrates. Carbs affect insulin, and insulin blocks ketosis. The key is to lower your carbs.

Ketosis is also not a high-protein diet. You want to consume only a moderate amount of protein: 3 to 8 oz is fine. You also don’t want to consume lean protein – low-fat protein can exacerbate insulin spikes. Always consume full-fat foods.

## Why is farm-raised salmon gray and need the synthetic coloring?

Here's what happens to the salmon and trout. Well, mainly salmon eat krill and shrimp. And then those krill and shrimp have microalgae. They'll eat that. And that has the pigment. So these pigments are created from the algae and this pigment is transferred. But of course, guess what? The farm raised salmon, they don't eat the krill. They eat soy, corn, animal products, a lot of other issues. So they don't have the natural pigment source. So they have to pay. The companies that make the farm fish have farm raised fish to have to pay to color it using a certain pigment that's made from petroleum chemicals and synthetic derivatives. And unfortunately it's expensive, too. It's like 20% of the fish's diet is the expense comes from the coloring agent, which is not the same as a natural thing. So there's a lot of issues with that.

## Why is fast food so addictive?

The Fast Food Industry's Tactics: How They Keep You Hooked and Harm Your Health

The average American consumes 150-200 fast food meals a year, spending $1500-$2000 on this habit. But what keeps us coming back for more, even though it's detrimental to our health?

The fast food industry employs various strategies to maintain our cravings:

* **Color Psychology:** McDonald's uses red and yellow, colors that trigger impulsivity, boost serotonin, and even encourage faster eating.
* **Targeting Children:** Playgrounds and happy meals entice young customers, creating lifelong habits.
* **Upselling & Pricing Tricks:** "Would you like fries with that?" or prices ending in 9 are tactics proven to increase sales.

Beyond marketing, the quality of ingredients is a major concern:

* **Low-Quality Meat:** McDonald's, a major beef buyer, uses factory-farmed beef fed with grains and antibiotics.
* **Processed Ingredients:** Fast food is rife with high fructose corn syrup, inflammatory oils, refined flours, and fillers like maltodextrin.

While fast food may seem like a cheap, convenient option, the long-term health consequences are significant. The inflammatory ingredients contribute to chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

Don't be fooled by the fast food industry's tricks. Choose whole, unprocessed foods for a healthier, happier life.

## Why is it important to buy grass-fed grass-finished beef or 100% grass-fed?

Many people envision cattle grazing in fields when they think of beef, and the term "grass-fed" on packaging reinforces this image. However, the reality of beef production in the country is often quite different. True grass-finished beef constitutes less than 1% of the total market.

Standard practice involves raising cattle on grass for about the first six months. They are then transferred to feedlots for several months (typically 4-6). Here, their diet is primarily grain, including waste products from ethanol production, combined with antibiotics and growth-promoting medications. This allows for an unnatural rate of weight gain, up to 3.5 pounds daily, focused solely on rapid fattening. The conditions in feedlots are highly restrictive; animals are kept in very tight quarters, equivalent to six cows occupying just one parking space for months on end.

This system culminates in the cattle being fattened and sent to slaughter. The challenge for consumers is that beef finished on grain is often marketed as "grass-fed." This can be misleading, leading consumers to pay considerably more (e.g., a 70% premium) for beef that did not complete its life cycle on grass, effectively paying a higher price for a grain-finished product. To ensure you are getting beef from animals raised exclusively on grass, labels specifying "grass-fed, grass-finished" or "100% grass-fed" are necessary.

## Why is it important to read labels on the food products?

One of my staff members purchased peanut butter and asked if it was ok to eat.

It turned out that the product was cookie butter and didn’t even include any peanuts in the ingredients! Upon reading the nutrition facts, I discovered that each 2-tablespoon serving of this cookie butter contained 11 grams of sugar. With 13 servings per container, the cookie butter contained more than 100 grams of sugar!

The first ingredient was wheat flour, followed by sugar and vegetable oil. The main vegetable oil used was soy oil which is GMO and highly inflammatory. Most of the ingredients in this “peanut butter” were highly addictive and highly inflammatory. Always read food labels in their entirety to avoid consuming harmful ingredients.

## Why should I drink coffee?

**Remember, don’t drink coffee if it gives you anxiety, increases your heart rate, or prevents you from sleeping. Too much coffee can increase cortisol and adrenaline, so limit your daily coffee intake to one cup.**

**Caffeine is a phytochemical found in coffee and other plants.** Caffeine keeps us awake by inhibiting a compound called adenosine. Coffee can give you mental acuity, help you focus, and improve your ability to learn. It speeds up the rate of metabolism and helps regulate blood sugar, especially if you add MCT oil or butter.

**Research has shown that coffee may even help decrease your risk of dementia! Here are some of the other potential health benefits of coffee:**

• Decreases symptoms related to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's

• Decreases risk of gallstones

• Increases the production and flow of bile

• Prevents kidney stones

• Has anti-cancer properties

• Has anti-inflammatory properties

• Has hepatoprotective properties

• Contains polyphenols to feed your microbiome

• Can help improve postural hypotension

• Improves exercise performance

• Increases cardiac output

• Delays muscle soreness

• Decreases symptoms experienced at high altitudes

• Increases mitochondrial biogenesis

• Increases stomach acid

## Why should you never drink seawater if you get stranded at sea?

It will actually cause dehydration because of the high salt levels. Because what happens is you're doing this concentrated salt and you are literally pulling any and all water out of your system. And your kidneys can't help but get rid of the salt. The little bit of water you have left. So basically you accelerate the death process. You accelerate your dehydration problem.

## Will avocados help me lose weight?

Avocados are high in calories, but there is no need to worry that you will gain weight. In fact, avocados contain avocatin B, a fat molecule that helps to shrink belly fat by stimulating your metabolism to burn fats.

Avocados' high fat and fiber content promotes satiety and reduces hunger, helping with weight management and weight loss.
