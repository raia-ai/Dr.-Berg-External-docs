# Weight Loss and Fitness

## After I started lifting weights, I noticed the arm in which my lymph nodes were removed was much larger than the other. Should I be concerned?

A noticeable difference in arm size after lymph node removal could indicate lymphatic fluid buildup. The lymphatic system helps manage fluid and supports circulation. Without sufficient lymphatic drainage, fluid can accumulate. It's important to consult a healthcare provider to assess the situation and ensure proper management. Consistent exercise can help maintain fluid flow and reduce swelling.

## Are cheat days on a diet beneficial?

Some weight loss plans have cheat days built into the program. But this isn’t a good idea because it can severely affect your results. Once you go off of a diet plan, it’s really hard to get back on it.

That said, sometimes it can be encouraging to go off keto just to see how much better you feel when you’re on keto and doing it correctly. The goal is to create enough health and discipline that you can go off of the keto plan very temporarily and then go right back on. The best way to tell if someone is cheating on keto or staying healthy is to look at their A1C. An A1C test measures how much glucose is stuck to the protein in your blood.

The more sugar in your body, the higher percentage of your hemoglobin is affected by glucose. You would want your A1C percentage to be below 5.7. The best way to know that the keto program is working and you’re in ketosis is a loss of appetite. But, all it takes is a very small amount of carbohydrates to take you out of ketosis for a couple of days—even half a glass of wine will have this effect.

**This means a cheat day will knock you out of the program for a good amount of time. If someone is cheating every other day or every third day, they're not going to make very good progress.**

**How to support healthy blood sugar:**

1\. Consume nutrient-dense foods on keto (Healthy Keto®)

2\. Consume apple cider vinegar in water

3\. Consume berberine

## Are frequent and small meals an effective strategy for weight loss?

One of the big tips for sticking to diets and losing weight is to eat frequent small meals. But, every time you eat, you increase insulin. In the presence of insulin, you can’t burn fat, and if you can’t burn fat, then you can’t lose weight. This can also cause insulin resistance, which can lead to a myriad of health concerns. Eating less frequently, also known as intermittent fasting, is one of the best things you can do to lose weight and support your overall health. To stay satisfied between meals without eating snacks, you need to feed the cells your body fat (burn fat). But, to burn fat, you have to lower your insulin by lowering your carbohydrates and eating less frequently. Once your body has adapted to burning fat, not only will you be able to lose weight, you will finally get rid of hunger and cravings for good.

## Berberine - Natural Ozempic

**Berberine: The Natural Supplement with Big Claims**

You might have seen buzz about berberine as the "natural Ozempic" on social media, but it's important to dig a little deeper.

**Understanding the Concerns**

There are several claims that berberine can cause side effects like diarrhea, gas, constipation, and stomach upset. In very large amounts, it could be harmful. There are also claims that berberine can’t work as a substitute for Ozempic because there isn’t enough research.

**The Potential Benefits of Berberine**

Berberine is a plant compound with a long history of use. It shows promise in several areas:

* **Blood Sugar Management:** May help with insulin resistance and lower blood sugar levels.
* **Overall Health:** Could support vitamin D activation, longevity, heart health, liver function, brain health, and even enhance cancer treatment efficiency.
* **Mitochondrial Boost:** Berberine might improve the number and function of mitochondria, the powerhouses of your cells.

**Key Takeaways**

Berberine, in moderate doses, appears safe for most people. It could offer noticeable benefits when combined with a healthy lifestyle like a keto diet, intermittent fasting, and exercise. However, it's crucial to remember:

* **Berberine is not a replacement for medication.** If you have a serious health condition, always consult your doctor before starting berberine.

## Can drinking water help you lose weight?

**Water for Weight Loss**

• The water will replace calories from food that could cause you to eat less, and eating less causes to lose more weight.

• Reduced hunger – Let your body adapt to the burning of fat to make your hunger completely go away.

• Stimulates metabolism – This is NOT true. Lowering the dominating hormones (estrogen, insulin, and cortisol) that can nullify all 6 fat-burning hormones can stimulate the metabolism - also with exercise and good quality of sleep.

**Ways to Reduce Hunger:**

• Lower insulin – Insulin is the key hormone that makes you hungry. Reduce insulin by reducing carbs and decrease the frequency of eating.

• Lower estrogen.

• Lower cortisol.

• Exercise.

• Sleep.

## Can I eat 4 eggs a day if I work out?

Yes! Eggs help you build muscle and can shorten recovery time.

## Can I eat apples during my weight loss journey?

I used to think apples were a great snack. I even used to recommend apples to help with weight loss, but I don’t anymore.

Recently I looked up the nutritional profile of an apple, and this is what I found:

• Saturated fats — .1g

• Cholesterol — 0g

• Carbohydrates — 25g

• Fiber — 44g

• Sugar — 19g

Apples have enough sugar to stop fat burning for at least one to two days.

At least until you’re at your ideal weight, I don’t think consuming apples (or any fruit) is a good idea.

## Can sport drinks cause dehydration and weight gain?

When you think about a sports drink, the first thing that comes to mind is hydration and increased performance. However, the ingredients in most sports drinks could cause the exact opposite. In fact, many studies show that sports drinks do not help your performance at all.

**Here’s why:**

1\. Sugar dehydrates you because it depletes minerals. Sports drinks are filled with tons of sugar. Some of them have the same amount of sugar as a soda. This can cause even more dehydration. Gatorade contains 36 grams of sugar.

2\. Sports drinks raise your insulin levels, which blocks fat burning and increases fat storage.

3\. Insulin spikes and sugar crashes can make you tired. In turn, your performance may suffer significantly.

4\. Sports drinks may lower your potassium, magnesium, and chromium. In summary, sports drinks are not good for hydrating you or losing weight. Instead, go with water or a keto-friendly sports drink with no sugar.

## Can too much protein make you fat?

**The hormone insulin has several functions. It converts what you eat to fat, and it prevents the release of fat from your body. Excessive amounts of protein will trigger insulin. But many people eat large amounts of protein without getting fat. Here’s why: protein triggers another hormone called glucagon, which is produced by alpha cells in your pancreas. Insulin is also produced in your pancreas, but by beta cells.**

**Glucagon helps you burn fat. If you eat a lot of protein, you trigger both of these hormones.** **You may not gain weight, but you might not lose it either because insulin prevents the fat-burning effect. It depends on what else you’re eating with the protein. If you’re eating carbohydrates, you’ll gain weight.** It also depends on how often you’re consuming protein. If you’re doing intermittent fasting, eating just one meal a day, you may still lose weight. But if you’re eating three meals per day with too much protein, you’ll have a hard time losing weight.

Carbohydrates trigger insulin, which is why overall it’s carbs instead of protein that causes weight gain. The big problem with eating too much protein over time is that you’ll overload your stomach, because you need a certain amount of hydrochloric acid to break down the protein. You may get putrefaction, body odor, or feel tired after eating. You could also overload your kidneys and liver because of too much nitrogen byproduct in your body, leading to a build-up of uric acid and even gout. How to check if you’re eating too much protein: you feel tired after you eat. Your urine is foamy. You may even get constipation. These are some points to consider if you wonder whether you’re eating too much protein.

**I typically recommend three to six ounces of protein per meal, but some people need more depending on their fitness level, metabolism, and ability to digest protein. Be sure to check to see if you’re eating too much protein, which can be detrimental to your health.**

## Compound Exercises to Help Insulin Resistance (Pre-Diabetes)

Doing the treadmill exercise for 45 minutes is not what you want to do, Instead add compound resistance exercise or training. This involves using larger muscle groups, and multiple joints to fatigue. This will release hormones like growth hormone, but will also deplete your glycogen reserves and even increase glucose sensitivity and reduce insulin. Less insulin means less insulin resistance.

***

## Could vitamin D help you lose more weight?

**Vitamin D: Your Weight Loss Ally**

Vitamin D could be a helpful tool in your weight loss journey. Here's why:

**Understanding Vitamin D Deficiency**

Several factors can contribute to low vitamin D levels, including:

* **Obesity**
* **Diabetes**
* **Insulin resistance**
* **Stress**
* **High blood pressure**
* **Autoimmune conditions**
* **Inflammation**

Notice something? Insulin resistance is a major link between these conditions and often contributes to weight gain struggles.

**How Vitamin D Supports Weight Loss**

* **Reduces stress:** Stress can sabotage weight loss efforts. Vitamin D helps manage stress levels.
* **Lowers insulin:** Vitamin D improves insulin sensitivity, promoting balanced blood sugar and reducing fat storage.
* **Fights inflammation:** Inflammation can hinder weight loss; vitamin D has anti-inflammatory properties.
* **Balances hormones:** Vitamin D helps regulate estrogen levels, which can impact weight distribution.
* **Promotes healthy gut bacteria:** A healthy gut supports overall health and weight management.
* **Reduces metabolic syndrome:** Vitamin D may decrease the risk of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of weight gain and health problems.

**Boosting Your Vitamin D for Weight Loss**

* **Sunshine:** Aim for regular, safe sun exposure.
* **Supplementation:** Consider a vitamin D supplement (20,000 IUs with vitamin K2)

## Do hormonal imbalances stop me from losing weight?

### **Hormonal Imbalances and Weight Loss**

Hormonal imbalances, such as disrupted estrogen levels, can significantly hinder weight loss. Imbalanced menstrual cycles can affect metabolism and weight management, making your efforts feel like they’re moving in slow motion. Addressing these hormonal issues is crucial for effective weight management and overall well-being.

**Sugar Cravings and Fat Burning**

Frequent sugar cravings often signal that your body is accustomed to using sugar for energy rather than fat. This preference for sugar can impede weight loss efforts. Transitioning to fat burning by reducing sugar intake can help manage cravings and support weight control.

***

## Do I have to eat more if I'm not losing weight?

The reason that you're not losing weight is that you're not eating enough. So the solution is to just eat more food, right?

This just doesn't make any sense. How could adding more food cause you to lose calories?

**What you do want to do to support healthy weight loss is to increase your nutrients. Vitamins, minerals, and other vital nutrients can help support a healthy body and promote weight loss.**

**The best way to lose weight is to cut out your carbohydrates and eat less frequently.** This doesn't mean you need to lower your calories—just avoid any calories from carbohydrates and eat less often. What this does is decreases insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the cause of a slow metabolism.

**If you can't seem to lose weight, this is a sign of insulin resistance.** Chances are, you are eating way too many carbohydrates. Keep in mind that lowering your calories is not a good idea either. Lowering your calories can deplete the body of nutrients and low down your metabolism further. Avoid low-calorie diets! In summary, Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting are the best ways to lose weight and support a healthy body.

## Does a healthy digestive tract guarantee good weight management?

### **Digestive Health's Role in Weight Management**

Regarding weight loss, [digestive issues like constipation, bloating, and a swollen stomach](https://www.drberg.com/blog/bloating-indigestion-constipation-and-acid-reflux) aren't just uncomfortable nuisances. They can actively throw a wrench into your efforts to shed pounds.

But why does this happen? It boils down to how well our bodies process and eliminate food.

If you constantly feel backed up or bloated, your body might not absorb nutrients efficiently or eliminate waste. This can lead to increased water retention and give the scale the appearance of stagnation or even gain.

Grasping the nuances of these obstacles is vital for folks aiming to navigate their weight management journey successfully.

## Does fiber make me fat?

Fiber is a carbohydrate, however, it doesn’t have a direct effect on blood sugars and you can’t even digest it.

The benefit of vegetable fiber is turning the microbes into a healthy fat called butyrate. Butyrate reduces insulin resistance which can help you lose weight.

Low amounts of microbes cause you to gain weight and the combination of low microbes in the gut and fiber could cause bloating, gas, and other issues. He also talks about several causes of low microbes and the condition called SIBO or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

**Vegetable Fibers Benefits:**

• Vitamins

• Minerals

• Trace minerals

• Butyrate

• B Vitamins

• Buffer pH

• Phytonutrients

**Functions of Bile:**

• Helps prevent fatty liver

• Helps with lowering blood sugars and improving insulin resistance

## Do's and Dont's Pre and Post Workout Meals

**Myth #1:** You have to replenish your glycogen reserve. You have a certain storage of sugar in your muscles and liver. After about a half hour of working out, you become tapped out of glycogen. After the glycogen stores are depleted, then you start burning fat. If your goal is to lose weight or get toned, then you want to deplete your glycogen stores. Replenishing them doesn’t make sense.

Additionally, every time you consume high-protein foods, like a protein bar or protein shake, it triggers insulin. Insulin stops the natural fat burning process.

**Myth #2:** You need to eat protein after a workout to build muscle. Anything you eat right before or after a workout will not immediately affect your muscle mass. It takes at least 24 hours for your digestive tract to break down protein into usable nutrients. The idea that a protein shake is immediately going to your muscles doesn’t add up.

You don’t really need protein around your workouts to build muscle mass. It’s the meal you ate yesterday that creates muscle today—keep that in mind. Additionally, if you consume too much protein, you will overload your liver, and it won’t end up as muscle.

What you really need to do is avoid things that spike your insulin levels around your workouts—this includes protein shakes and protein bars. You should also know that insulin nullifies growth hormone. When you work out, you induce a stress event that breaks down muscles. During the recovery process is when your body builds muscle. Growth hormone is instrumental—which means that spiking insulin is a huge problem.

**Tips for getting the most out of your workout:**

• Get good sleep

• Don’t eat anything before, during, or after your workout

• Avoid insulin-spiking foods

## How can I burn more calories without exercising and eating less?

I’ll show you how to burn more calories without exercising or eating less. Yes, it’s absolutely possible if you have the right information. Most people believe you have to exercise more and eat fewer calories because one pound of fat is 3,500 calories. So if it’s an average of 1800-2200 calories to run my body, and I eat fewer calories than that but exercise more, the problem is solved.

A UK website that gets over 43 million views per month says this: don’t skip your breakfast, eat regular meals, eat plenty of fruit and vegetables, walk more to get more steps, drink more water, consume higher fiber foods, use a smaller plate, and don’t ban any specific food. They say you must eat in moderation. But here’s the big problem. You have two types of stored fuel; glycogen (sugar) and fat. The average person has 1700 calories of stored glycogen but 100,000 calories of fat. So how do you burn more fat calories? Because the goal isn’t to just burn off sugar calories then get hungry for carbs.

**Doing everything in moderation will burn off glycogen but not fat. You have to treat types of calories differently. So, lower your carbs, eat moderate protein (the only time the advice to eat in moderation is accurate), and increase your fat consumption. Bring your carbs as close to zero as possible to maximize your fat burning.**

**As you feed your body fewer carbs your metabolism actually speeds up. You heal a condition called insulin resistance. Exercise is responsible for only about 15 percent of your weight loss. 85 percent is diet.**

This is how to burn more calories without exercising or eating less.

## How can I eat what I want and still lose belly fat?

It's more effective to change when you eat than what you eat to lose weight. Follow this guideline: have your first meal at 1:00 PM and your last meal at 5:00 PM, creating a 4-hour eating window. If this is too challenging, you can start with a 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM window instead. If needed, you can also include bulletproof coffee in the morning to help manage your eating window.

Benefits of This Eating Pattern:

• Significantly reduces insulin levels

• Promotes fat release through decreased insulin

• Reduces hunger and cravings

***

## How can I efficiently speed up muscle growth?

High-intensity exercise and protein consumption build muscle. Aim to consume .8 to 1.5 grams of high-quality protein per kilogram of lean body mass. Athletes may need to consume up to 2 grams of protein per kilogram.

1\. Creatine

Creatine is found in foods, but if you want to grow your muscles quickly, take creatine as a supplement. Creatine acts as a substitute for energy, especially for short-duration high-intensity exercise. Try taking 20 grams of creatine for five days, then a maintenance dosage of 3 grams daily for the rest of the month, and then continue this cycle between the large and small amounts.

2\. Cold therapy

Cold showers, cold immersion, and cryotherapy require your body to generate a tremendous amount of energy to maintain its core temperature. To do this, your body generates a type of fat known as brown fat, which stimulates white fat. This burns a lot of calories! Cold therapy increases the expression of muscle genes in both rats and humans. It increases RNA, which makes the proteins you need to build muscle. Cold therapy also decreases inflammation.

3\. Intermittent fasting

Intermittent fasting stimulates growth hormone, which increases muscle growth. Aim for two meals daily without decreasing your caloric intake—and cut the snacks! Intermittent fasting helps improve insulin resistance, which gets more insulin to the muscle.

4\. Arginine Arginine also increases growth hormone by inhibiting a hormone called somatostatin. Arginine has even been used to increase growth in children. Try taking 3 to 6 grams daily on an empty stomach 30 minutes before you work out.

## How can I guarantee sustainable weight loss?

Guaranteeing Sustainable Weight Loss

**1. Manage Carbohydrate Intake**

Opt for nutrient-rich, whole foods over refined carbs. Incorporate fruits, vegetables, and whole grains for fiber and essential nutrients. Consider lower-carb diets like keto or paleo under professional guidance.

**2. Incorporate Healthy Fats and Proteins**

Include sources of healthy fats such as avocados, nuts, and olive oil, and lean proteins like chicken, fish, and legumes. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight to maintain muscle mass and support recovery.

**3. Combine Effective Strategies**

Integrate the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting for enhanced fat burning and improved insulin sensitivity. For those post-gastric sleeve surgery, intermittent fasting can aid in maintaining weight loss and managing hunger.

Sustainable weight loss is a gradual process requiring balanced nutrition and consistent strategies. Celebrate progress and maintain a long-term focus for lasting success.

## How can I help a friend to lose weight?

The #1 thing to do is help educate them about these problems. I’m going to talk about these issues in detail. Take a look.

**1. Cutting Calories**

The most common mistake people make with weight loss is cutting calories. It is true that you want to reduce the frequency of meals, but you don’t want to lower your calories. Calorie reductions can cause:

• Slow metabolism

• Constant hunger

• Nutrient deficiencies.

**2. Low Fat**

You need healthy fats in your diet. Many people try to cut back on fats like butter and animal fat, but this is a mistake. Low-fat protein is actually much higher on the glycemic index. What this means is that it will cause your insulin to spike. The more their food choices trigger insulin, the less weight they’re going to lose. Keep in mind that fat has the least effect on insulin.

**3. High Carbs**

In the presence of too much insulin, you cannot lose fat. Insulin is a fat-storing hormone. Carbs are very high on the glycemic index. If you are eating carbs, you don’t be able to lose weight, you will have frequent cravings, and you will likely gain even more weight. Cut out the carbs by going on a healthy keto diet.

**4. Monitoring Steps + Drinking Lots of Water**

This happens a lot with people who try to lose weight. They count steps, hit the treadmill or stationary bike, and drink lots of water, but they still don’t see significant results. Why? Because these things are only effective if you first work on the diet. In fact, exercise only makes up about 15% of weight loss results. Put more energy into your diet, and you’ll see far more results.

**5. Weighing Daily**

As you’ve probably heard me say before, get healthy to lose weight—don’t lose weight to get healthy. If you put too much of your attention on losing weight, you’re doing things backward. The main thing you can do to get healthy is to work on fixing insulin resistance with healthy keto and intermittent fasting. This can take time, so be patient.

**6. Six Small Meals Per Day**

Every time you eat, you trigger insulin. If you consume 6 small meals every day, you are spiking your insulin over and over. This makes weight loss very difficult. Instead, do intermittent fasting. This will help fight off cravings, fix insulin resistance, and burn fat.

Educate your friends and family on these points. This will give them the basics to help them lose weight.

## How can I lose weight fast while breastfeeding?

Following a nutritious low-carb diet like Healthy Keto, avoiding processed foods and sugars, focusing on nutrient-dense foods, and incorporating low-impact exercises into your lifestyle helps to lose weight fast while breastfeeding.

## How can I lose weight without dieting?

It's very difficult to lose even one pound of body fat without changing your diet. If you eat junk food, you’ll have to burn even more calories to burn extra fat. Weight loss is 15% exercise and 85% diet! You have to change your diet if you want to lose weight. There’s no way around it! Exercise improves fitness, muscle tone, and health, but it is not the key to weight loss and certainly won’t help you lose weight fast.

If you want to lose fat and not just water weight, you have to keep insulin low. Decreasing insulin will also decrease your appetite and cravings. To reduce insulin, you must go on a low-carb diet!

The carnivore diet involves eliminating all carbohydrates and eating meat, eggs, fish, and cheese. This simple diet can help you lose weight fast!

Intermittent fasting is the key to fat loss. It can also help with other health problems, such as inflammation, high blood pressure, diabetes, and depression. Remember, carbs block fat burning.

You can lose weight without changing your diet, but it won't be much!

## How can I maintain weight loss after Ozempic?

Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of Ozempic is crucial when considering how to manage your weight after stopping this medication.

As a GLP-1 Agonist, Ozempic mimics a hormone in your small intestine that helps regulate insulin levels, control appetite, and slow down gastric emptying. While this can aid in weight loss, it can also lead to adverse side effects.

**These side effects may include:**

• Nutrient deficiency

• Gastroparesis

• Constipation

• Gallbladder problems

• Thyroid tumors and cancer

**To help maintain your weight after Ozempic, it’s crucial to make certain lifestyle changes, such as:**

1\. Follow a ketogenic diet to keep insulin levels low and promote fat-burning.

2\. Do intermittent fasting to control appetite and improve hormone balance.

3\. Incorporate weight training to build and preserve muscle mass.

Additionally, ensuring adequate protein intake is crucial for maintaining muscle mass, especially for those who have already lost a significant amount of muscle while on Ozempic. This can be achieved through consuming bioavailable proteins such as red meat, eggs, and fish. Monitoring your hormone levels and ensuring proper cholesterol intake is also important, as cholesterol is a building block for many hormones, including testosterone and estrogen.

## How can I permanently stick to a weight loss plan?

**The biggest reasons people can’t stick to a diet are #1 hunger and #2 cravings.**

**There are two main hormones involved in hunger and cravings:**

1\. Ghrelin — This hormone makes you hungry, so we want to decrease it.

2\. Leptin — This hormone makes you feel satisfied, so we want to increase it.

**The best ways to stick with your eating plan and lose weight:**

• Get more sleep

• Decrease sugar

• Consume an adequate amount of protein

• Get plenty of fiber

• Decrease stress

• Avoid alcohol and smoking

• Keep caffeine consumption to a minimum

• Consume healthy fats

• Eat slowly

• Decrease carbohydrates

• Take l-tryptophan (for cravings during menstrual cycles)

• Consume nutrient-dense foods

• Do intermittent fasting

Gastric bypass and certain medications can also increase hunger.

One of the big tips for sticking to diets and losing weight is to eat frequent small meals. But, every time you eat, you increase insulin. In the presence of insulin, you can’t burn fat, and if you can’t burn fat, then you can’t lose weight. This can also cause insulin resistance, which can lead to a myriad of health concerns. Eating less frequently, also known as intermittent fasting, is one of the best things you can do to lose weight and support your overall health.

To stay satisfied between meals without eating snacks, you need to feed the cells your body fat (burn fat). But, to burn fat, you have to lower your insulin by lowering your carbohydrates and eating less frequently. Once your body has adapted to burning fat, not only will you be able to lose weight, you will finally get rid of hunger and cravings for good.

## How can I save time when losing weight?

Here is a video from Dr. Berg on this subject:

## How can I stop overeating and be satisfied with food?

**There are three things I’ve covered on this topic before:**

1\. Consume more fat

2\. Eat nutrient-dense foods

3\. Support healthy digestion

The above three things are important. But the best way to satisfy hunger and stop overeating is to consume the right amount of protein. One study found that certain insects will continue to eat until their protein requirements are met. If you put these insects on a low-protein diet, they will overeat. However, you don’t want to consume too much protein. Excess protein is not stored and will convert to sugar. The right amount of protein will give your body what it needs without converting to sugar or fat.

***

## How can I stop weight gain during perimenopause?

To prevent weight gain during perimenopause, especially around the midsection, consider gradually reducing your meal frequency until you reach one meal a day. This approach can help counteract the slower metabolism that often comes with age. Periodic longer fasts can also be highly effective in accelerating results. Additionally, closely monitor your calorie intake and aim to keep carbohydrates to a minimum for optimal results.

## How not to get your wife to lose weight? FOR MEN ONLY

The best way to get your wife to lose weight, hands down, is by using cash. Of course, I’m kidding!

First, let’s talk about what not to do. The next time you hug her, don’t pinch her fat. Stop giving her candy, donuts, and other similar items. When you’re at a restaurant and she orders something like bread or pasta, don’t shame her. For Christmas or her birthday, don’t give her presents like a scale, a tape measure, or a gym membership.

Okay, so what can you do? Lead by example. Get yourself in shape. Ask if she wants to come with you to the gym. If she says yes, great. If not, drop it. Send her one of my videos on metabolism. If she wants to watch it, great. If not, drop it. Validate her. Tell her she’s beautiful. Build her up.

If you’ve tried all these positive approaches but they don’t work, then use the cash. I’m joking! Take a positive approach to help your wife lose weight.

## How to efficiently get rid of the double chin?

I’m going to show you four easy double chin exercises that can get rid of a turkey neck for good. Because of the typical loose skin, a double chin is often referred to as a turkey neck. If you do these double chin exercises on a regular basis, you will see massive improvement! As we age, we develop loose skin, especially under the neck, which does not get much exercise. There’s a superficial and a deep layer of connective tissue called fascia under the skin on your neck. The muscles and fascia in your neck are responsible for head flexion, chin movement, and jaw movement. The first face exercise works the muscle that pulls the jaw down when you open your mouth. The next exercise, which looks like a frown, activates the superficial fascia. The third exercise creates an elongation and deep stretch of the fascia. The fourth and final exercise allows for head flexion to strengthen and tone the fascia. Remember, If you don't use it, you lose it! Stretching, strengthening, and tightening the fascia with these simple double chin exercises can eliminate a turkey neck!

## How to get faster weight loss despite having hypothyroidism?

It’s a complex subject because there are different kinds of hypothyroidism such as Hashimoto’s and non-Hashimotos. Sometimes you can’t figure out what’s important and what’s trivial information. In this video, I focus on the most important things you need to know to achieve weight loss with a hypothyroid condition.

Your thyroid is located at the bottom of your neck. It produces a hormone called T4 which is an inactive thyroid hormone. T4 converts to T3 which is the active thyroid hormone. T3 goes into your cells and speeds up your metabolism as well as weight loss. 80 percent of conversion happens through your liver, 20 percent happens through your kidneys.

So many people with hypothyroid conditions have a fatty liver. If you have belly fat chances are you have a fatty liver, which decreases the capacity to convert T4 to T3. Your focus is to get the fat off your liver and improve its function. But it could also be a function of your gallbladder, or perhaps cirrhosis of your liver.

You’d think cutting fat from your diet would make the fat on your liver go away but that’s not what you want to do. You do need to cut carbs which is why I recommend keto and intermittent fasting.

As well, here are some things to speed up the process: Choline is one of the most powerful nutrients to strip fat from your liver very quickly. Get high quality choline and start taking it. It dissolves fat. Egg yolks have the highest amount of choline in a food. If you have a choline deficiency you could potentially get a fatty liver.

Selenium is also involved in the conversion of T4 to T3. It’s an antioxidant and is especially important if you have Hashimoto’s. Also, do more strict intermittent fasting to decrease inflammation and boost your immune system.

Iodine is part of the raw material to build thyroid hormones. I recommend consuming sea kelp as a source of iodine. Next is zinc which will help with almost every single side effect of being hypothyroid such as hair loss, fatigue, and constipation. It’s in oysters, meat, and pumpkin seeds, but I recommend taking a supplement. These are the steps you can take to get faster weight loss even with hypothyroidism.

## How to grow your muscles?

**Building Muscle on Keto with Intermittent Fasting**

Keto and intermittent fasting can support muscle growth, but exercise is essential. Here's what you need to know:

* **Intensity Matters:** Muscle growth depends on challenging workouts. Focus on pushing yourself to your limits.
* **Benefits of Fasting:** Fasting boosts human growth hormone (HGH), aiding muscle growth and preservation. Minimize snacking to maximize HGH benefits.
* **The Keto Advantage:** A well-formulated keto plan with intermittent fasting sets the stage for muscle building:
  * 2 meals a day
  * 50g carbs per day
  * 7-8 oz. protein per meal
  * Prioritize sleep

**The Dorian Yates Approach (Advanced)**

Inspired by 6-time Mr. Olympia Dorian Yates, this intense strategy can accelerate results:

1. **Warm-Up:** Light sets prepare your muscles.
2. **Go All Out:** One extremely hard set of 6-8 reps, then assisted reps to push beyond failure.
3. **Controlled Negatives:** Focus on the eccentric (lengthening) phase of each exercise.
4. **Full Recovery:** Work each muscle group once a week for optimal repair.

**Important Notes:**

* **Start Gradually:** If you're new to this intensity, ease in and consider a trainer's guidance.
* **Recovery is Key:** Intense workouts require ample rest for maximum muscle growth.

## How to lose arm fat?

Flabby arms can be a frustrating problem for many individuals, especially as they age. The loss of muscle mass and strength in this area can not only affect physical appearance but also limit daily activities and overall quality of life. In addition to sarcopenia, the process of age-related muscle loss, flabby arms can also be caused by weakened fascia. Fascia is a connective tissue that surrounds and supports muscles and other structures in the body. Without proper maintenance and movement, it can become tight or restricted, leading to a decreased range of motion and weakness in the associated muscles. This is why targeting both the muscles and fascia is crucial for effectively improving flabby arms.

Functional exercises, which involve multi-joint movements that mimic everyday tasks, are key to targeting muscle and fascial health. Working multiple muscles and joints at once helps strengthen and activate the surrounding fascia, which can lead to tighter, more toned arms with improved strength and function. To incorporate exercises into your routine to help improve the fascia, I recommend trying out the three workout videos linked above. These videos focus on a variety of movements that target the arms, shoulders, and fascia for a well-rounded approach to flabby arm reduction.

## How to tighten and flatten stomach just in a few days?

A caloric deficit is not a sustainable way to lose weight or get a flat stomach! Most people find that their metabolism slows down in their 20s and 30s after a series of calorie-restrictive diets. Lowering calories increases hunger and cravings, which will require immense willpower and can stifle weight loss. The caloric deficit model is not sustainable!

Insulin is the hormone that controls whether you burn or store fat. If you reduce insulin, you can tap into your body fat for energy. Carbohydrates have the most significant effect on insulin, while fat is neutral and protein has a moderate impact. All calories are not the same! To lose weight, you must lower insulin, which means you must reduce your carb intake. If you’re on a low-carb diet, your body can use both food and body fat for fuel. This eliminates hunger and cravings between meals. Fat provides more than double the energy of glucose.

It takes 2 to 3 days to get into ketosis and 2 to 3 weeks for fat adaptation. Fat adaptation means your body is burning the most fat possible. Your body can burn ketones and fat, which are two different fuel sources. To get your body into ketosis, carbohydrates should make up about 5% of your diet, protein 20%, and fat 75%. Visceral fat in the abdomen may prevent a flat belly, but you can eliminate it with this diet. The dead bug exercise stimulates the fascia and muscles that can act as a girdle, giving you a flat belly fast! Do this exercise every day, and within 1 to 2 weeks, you will start to see amazing results!

## If I don’t consume glucose, I hit a wall when running. What can I do?

I think you just need to kind of study some of the long distance runners that have got into a really good keto adaptation to the point where or fat adaptation, where they can just oxidize fat like way better than anyone else. And because what's happening, you're running up against the loss of glycogen. And now, where's the fuel? Your body just hasn't really been able to tap into the fat because you're not fully converted over yet and that takes some time. That's what I would shoot for as a long term goal.

A couple other things I would recommend. I would maybe as a transition, you do not the glucose but maybe you do some fruit. Try that for a while. Then push that to the side. And then maybe you do maybe a starch.

So it's kind of a stair-step approach because when you do this straight those packs are just pure dextrose synthetic from corn syrup. They're just going to deplete a lot of B vitamins, B1, and that's going to affect your performance as well as deplete other things too. So you're taking this refined sugar. I think they even use maltodextrin. It's just so refined and it's going to be burned as fuel but it's going to come with a package because in order to burn that fuel, you need a lot of other nutrients. So at the very, very minimum, you should be taking B vitamins, electrolytes, not too many but just enough to compensate for that refined sugar that's going to deplete.

***

## I'm addicted to sugar but I feel great when I'm on Keto. I want to lose weight - any word of advice?

Now we have to pretend that sugar is scarce. And so you have to do all sorts of things from not buying it, you know, cleaning out your sugar from your house. In fact, I think that would be a really good thing to do.

Go through all your cupboards, your refrigerator and remove all the sugar, get it out because, that late night when you're craving and you're going to your fridge and you're debating whether you're going to drive to the store or not, but you got to drive. So that will discourage you.

But the other thing too, is that once you get off sugar, okay, it might take a week or two, but then you're going to adapt to fat burning and your cravings will go away unless you eat them again.

And the other thing too is just the attitude of being in charge of your body. Because your body will give you all sorts of crazy messages like I want that donut over there.

## I'm losing weight so slowly - what can I do about it?

There’s a big difference between not losing any weight and losing weight slowly—and the actions you need to take for each will be entirely different. If you’re not experiencing any weight loss, you have to make a big change.

There’s something affecting your weight loss, and it could be related to your thyroid, adrenals, kidneys, and other parts of your body. To figure out what’s behind this issue, you have to dig deeper and do some testing. If you are experiencing some weight loss, you don’t want to make any huge changes. Instead, you want to strengthen your successful weight loss efforts.

Start by looking at the quality and quantity of your foods. Make sure you’re having moderate amounts of protein, plenty of healthy fats (avoid vegetable oils!), and very low amounts of carbohydrates and sugars (only get your carbs from low-carb vegetables). Avoid snacking. You should only eat 1-3 times a day. Intermittent fasting is a fantastic way to support a healthy body and avoid insulin spikes that block weight loss.

Problems with your sleep, digestion, or mensural cycle may also slow down weight loss. Insulin and Glucose Support is a great supplement for promoting weight loss if you have insulin issues.

## I'm on the weight loss journey - can I eat healthy snacks?

People will tell you that in order to lose weight, you need to snack before you get too hungry, or snack to trigger your metabolism or snack to prevent overeating.

It's snacking camouflaged as "Healthy snacking". All these extra meals even if they are small and healthy create a spike in insulin - this adds up.

Insulin is the FAT-MAKING hormone, AND IT PREVENTS FAT BURNING. We snack on liquids too. The grocery store is filled with all sorts of new snacks protein bars, jerky, drinks, and granola bars, with added buzz words like "gluten free" or "organic" or "natural", but it's still food.

Even fruit between meals can block weight loss. I myself cut fruit out between meals and went from 211 pounds to 185 pounds in 6 weeks.

## Is coffee with sugar safe to drink long term?

**Why the Sugar and Caffeine Combo is Bad for Chronic Fatigue**

Combining sugar and caffeine in energy drinks can worsen chronic fatigue symptoms instead of providing relief. Here's why:

* **Sugar Overload:** Popular energy drinks are packed with alarming amounts of sugar, exceeding even Coca-Cola. This sugar rush causes a temporary energy spike followed by a crash, leading to low blood sugar symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, and irritability.
* **Nutrient Depletion:** Sugar in energy drinks lacks essential cofactors needed for energy production, forcing your body to deplete its nutrient reserves to metabolize the sugar.
* **Caffeine's False Energy:** Caffeine doesn't provide true energy but merely masks tiredness. High caffeine levels in energy drinks lead to increased stress hormones, dehydration, adrenal fatigue, and disrupted sleep – all detrimental to chronic fatigue sufferers.
* **Hidden Sugars:** Even seemingly healthier options like Celsius contain sucralose, an artificial sweetener that can negatively impact your body similar to sugar.

**The Better Solution**

Focus on sustainable energy sources by correcting your diet. Prioritize nutrient-dense foods, adequate electrolytes, and salt intake. This approach supports your body's natural energy production processes, promoting long-term well-being and combating chronic fatigue effectively.

## Is it a good idea to add cheat days into my diet plan?

Some weight loss plans have cheat days built into the program. But this isn’t a good idea because it can severely affect your results. Once you go off of a diet plan, it’s really hard to get back on it. That said, sometimes it can be encouraging to go off keto just to see how much better you feel when you’re on keto and doing it correctly.

The goal is to create enough health and discipline that you can go off of the keto plan very temporarily and then go right back on. The best way to tell if someone is cheating on keto or staying healthy is to look at their A1C. An A1C test measures how much glucose is stuck to the protein in your blood. The more sugar in your body, the higher percentage of your hemoglobin is affected by glucose. You would want your A1C percentage to be below 5.7.

The best way to know that the keto program is working and you’re in ketosis is a loss of appetite. But, all it takes is a very small amount of carbohydrates to take you out of ketosis for a couple of days—even half a glass of wine will have this effect. This means a cheat day will knock you out of the program for a good amount of time. If someone is cheating every other day or every third day, they're not going to make very good progress.

## Is losing 5 pounds per month normal?

It depends. Some people would say that it’s not normal and that you should be losing a lot more.

When you evaluate anything, you’re comparing what’s normal and what’s going on with you. So, it’s very important for you to know what is normal and what’s not. Someone with a healthy fast metabolism could lose about two pounds of fat per week. If a person is fasting for a week, they might lose about 3.5 pounds.

But, you might have a slow metabolism, which means you might only lose one pound per week. Normal weight loss for someone with a slow metabolism is half a pound to one pound of fat per week. So, four pounds of fat loss per month isn’t bad for someone with a slow metabolism.

It’s important to keep in mind that it only takes a tiny amount of carbohydrates to block fat burning for two to three days. There are different factors like this to look at, so you can know what normal actually is and so you don’t get frustrated and give up when it’s actually working.

## Is there a better option for Ozempic?

Visceral fat surrounds the organs and keeps your body in a state of inflammation, preventing fat loss. Avoid these 6 foods that prevent fat loss.

1\. Low-fat yogurt

Low-fat yogurt is typically high in sugar and often contains industrial food starches like modified food starch, modified corn starch, or maltodextrin. Starch is not sweet, so people consume much more than sugar. It’s higher on the glycemic index than sugar and is used to add bulk to a product.

2\. Processed meat

Hot dogs contain industrial sugars such as corn syrup that will spike blood sugar. Adding sugar to meat creates advanced glycated proteins. Organic grass-fed beef hot dogs are a good option!

3\. Atkins products

These products are marketed as low-carb and keto-friendly but contain very low-quality ingredients such as soy protein isolates, seed oils, GMOs, and synthetic fibers. These can cause bloating and diarrhea and also prevent fat loss.

4\. Juice

Many products marketed as “juice” often only contain minimal amounts of fruit juice and have high amounts of sweeteners, such as high-fructose corn syrup. Juice from concentrate is devoid of nutrients. Fructose found in fruit juice can only be broken down by the liver, which can contribute more to a fatty liver than glucose.

5\. Agave nectar

This sweetener seems healthy but is very high in fructose, which is hard on the liver. Coconut sugar and honey are better options but should be avoided when focusing on fat loss.

6\. Mayonnaise

Processed mayo is mainly composed of soy oil. This type of fat is stored in the fat cells and isn’t burned by the body as quickly as saturated fat. Seed oils like soy oil may be at the root of chronic disease.

## Mastering Workout Intensity with Dorian Yates' Principles

### **Mastering Workout Intensity with Dorian Yates' Principles**

Dorian Yates didn't become a 6-time Mr. Olympia by accident. His secret weapon? Intensity.

Yates believed in quality over quantity. Instead of endless sets and reps, he focused on pushing each set to the absolute limit.

#### **The Power of One Set to Failure**

Yates' training philosophy revolved around one all-out working set per exercise. He'd start with a few warm-up sets, gradually increasing the weight. Then, he'd perform one set of 6-8 reps to complete failure - and beyond.

By "beyond," I mean forced reps, negatives, and rest-pause sets. He'd keep going until there was nothing left in the tank.

This high-intensity approach is efficient for triggering muscle growth. It maximizes muscle fiber recruitment and stimulates the release of anabolic hormones like testosterone and growth hormone.

#### **Perfecting Form and Focusing on Eccentric Movements**

Yates was a stickler for form. He believed proper technique was essential for maximizing muscle tension and minimizing injury risk.

His mission was to zero in on each muscle group, ensuring he nailed the perfect form from start to finish. No swinging, cheating, or momentum allowed.

Yates also emphasized the importance of each rep's eccentric (lowering) phase. He would reduce the weight slowly and keep it under control, taking about 4 seconds per rep.

This eccentric emphasis is key for causing muscle damage and stimulating growth.

## Should I cut out cheese to lose more weight?

Cutting out cheese, especially if it's made from pasteurized milk, can be beneficial for weight loss. However, when hitting a plateau, it's important to review a few key factors: reassess your carb intake, ensure you're fasting adequately, focus on high-quality foods, prioritize good sleep, manage stress effectively, and support healthy digestion. These elements together can help you break through weight loss plateaus.

## The Best Types of Exercises for Recovery

There are three main types of muscle contractions:

* **Isometric:** The muscle contracts, but its length stays the same (like holding a plank).
* **Concentric:** The muscle shortens while contracting (like the upward phase of a bicep curl).
* **Eccentric:** The muscle lengthens while contracting (like the downward phase of a bicep curl).

**Why Eccentric Training Matters**

Eccentric contractions offer unique benefits compared to concentric movements:

* **Muscle Growth:** Eccentric training may lead to increased muscle size and strength.
* **Force Production:** You can generate greater force during eccentric movements.
* **Efficient Repair:** Eccentric focus promotes healthy muscle repair and recovery.
* **Metabolic Advantages:** Eccentric training may be more efficient for boosting metabolism and reducing inflammation.
*   **Specific Conditions:** Eccentric exercises might benefit people with muscle loss (sarcopenia), reduced bone density (osteopenia), or tendon injuries.

## Triggers for Enhancing Fat Burning

Boosting Fat Burning: A Comprehensive Approach

**1. Exercise and Adrenaline**

Intense exercise, especially high-intensity interval training (HIIT), stimulates adrenaline release, activating lipase to break down stored fat into free fatty acids for energy.

**2. Intermittent Fasting**

Intermittent fasting lowers insulin levels, enhancing the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase and promoting fat breakdown. It also increases growth hormone levels, further supporting fat loss.

**3. Dietary Impact**

Reducing refined carbohydrates and sugars helps keep insulin levels low, facilitating fat burning. Including protein and healthy fats supports this process. Foods like green tea extract can boost fat oxidation and thermogenesis.

**4. Hormonal Triggers**

Growth hormone, thyroid hormones, and lipase are key to fat metabolism. Intense exercise, fasting, adequate sleep, and balanced nutrition help regulate these hormones for effective fat burning.

By aligning exercise, diet, and hormonal management, you can turn your body into an efficient fat-burning machine.

***

## What are some different ways to burn fat?

Insulin is one of the most important hormones related to fat burning. It’s produced in the pancreas and tells your body to store fat. You can not burn fat if insulin is too high. Aim for less than 50 grams of carbs per day to avoid spiking insulin. Intermittent fasting can also help prevent insulin spikes.

Seed oils and modified food starches like MSG trigger insulin and inflammation and should be avoided.

**To help lower insulin, do the following:**

1\. Lower your carbohydrate intake

2\. Do intermittent fasting

3\. Drink apple cider vinegar with water

4\. Consume berberine and cinnamon

**Estrogen and cortisol** can also cause your body to store fat. To lower estrogen, avoid synthetic hormones and chemicals in your environment. Choose organic foods to avoid pesticides and herbicides that mimic estrogen in the body.

**To minimize cortisol**, focus on stress reduction. Physical activity like housework, long walks, or exercise can get your mind off of stress. Vitamin B1 and vitamin D are also very important for keeping cortisol levels low.

**Growth hormone and IGF-1** (Insulin-like growth factor 1) are the main hormones involved in fat burning. Intense exercise, good sleep habits, moderate protein intake, and intermittent fasting trigger growth hormone and IGF-1. Sprinting is one of the best workouts to trigger these hormones to burn fat.

**Testosterone, glucagon, thyroid hormone (T3), and adrenaline are also important for fat-burning.** To boost testosterone naturally, ensure that you’re consuming foods high in zinc and make sure you’re getting enough cholesterol.

**Exercise** is important, but only contributes to about 15% of your overall weight loss. Exercise can lower stress, improve sleep, and also trigger glucagon and adrenaline.

1\. Prevents the loss of muscle mass

2\. Builds antioxidant reserve

3\. Stabilizes blood sugar

4\. Increases oxygen (gives you energy)

5\. Decreases stress

6\. Enhances sleep

7\. Increases flexibility

8\. Strengthens the heart

9\. Enhances cognitive function and mood

## What are the important factors in building muscle mass beyond protein?

We often think that increasing protein helps build muscle because muscle is made of protein. But this doesn’t always work. Some people that eat more protein may even suffer from amino acid deficiency. You need sufficient amounts of protein to build muscle, but, more importantly, you need sufficient amino acids.

The general thought is that you need .8 grams of protein per kilogram of lean body mass—not overall weight. This might look like around 50 grams of protein per day. A moderate amount of protein would be between 1.2 and 1.7 grams per kilogram of lean body mass. High protein would be about 2 grams per kilogram of lean body mass.

**It’s essential to focus on consuming quality protein from eggs, meat, fish, and dairy. It’s not ideal to rely on getting your protein from plant sources or protein powder to build healthy muscles.**

**Factors that influence the production of muscle protein:**

**1. Insulin resistance**

What to do:

• Get on a low-carb diet (Healthy Keto®)

• Do intermittent fasting

**2. Growth hormone**

What to do:

• Intense exercise

• Get plenty of sleep

• Do intermittent fasting

**3. Testosterone**

What to do:

• Consume zinc (red meat, shellfish, seafood)

• Avoid refined carbs and sugar

• Lower your stress

• Avoid soy protein isolates, soy milk, beer, and alcohol

**4. Stress**

What to do:

• Take a look at my other videos on how to lower stress

**5. The microbiome**

What to do:

• Consume probiotic foods

**6. Low stomach acid**

What to do:

• Take betaine hydrochloride

**7. Low enzymes in the pancreas or small intestine**

What to do:

• Consume enzyme-rich foods

• Take an amino acid supplement

**8. Lean protein**

What to do:

• Consume fattier protein sources

## What are the most famous myths about "healthy" weight loss?

Here are 7 lessons I learned from weight loss failures from my practice of 25 years and working with 40,000 people.

1\. Fruit – Don’t use fruit if you are trying to lose weight and someone who has a slow metabolism. Even small amounts of fruit can block a lot of fat burning.

2\. Snacks – Snacking increases insulin because every time you eat, you trigger insulin. Cutting out snacks creates huge benefits.

3\. 2 weeks – low protein (Liver enhancement) or no protein – would cause a lot of blood sugar issues because our bodies need amino acids to rebuild and repair. Cutting it too low or not enough will cause problems like hair loss, loss of muscle, etc.

4\. “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day” – It screws up and breaks the all-night fasting. Push yourself to eat closer to lunch and not eat until you’re hungry and eventually skip breakfast.

5\. Low Fat (Lean Protein) – Fat is very important to satisfy the appetite to go from one meal to another. It is the only macronutrient that doesn’t trigger insulin – the more pure the fat is, the lower the influence it has on insulin.

6\. History – Clue (Ignoring – Focusing more on diving into the process directly and not ignoring the clues.

7\. Omitting Getting Healthy First – It is not losing weight to get healthy, it is getting healthy first and then losing the weight. Focus on the health indicators: energy level, cravings are gone, stress level better.

## What are top foods to lose belly fat?

Cortisol, a stress hormone, converts protein into sugar, prompting the liver to produce sugar from non-carbohydrate sources like fat, ketones, and protein. High cortisol levels lead to increased sugar production, which elevates insulin, and in turn, contributes to belly fat. Consuming a high-carb diet, sugar, or eating frequently also spikes insulin, leading to belly fat.

Belly fat typically appears after the liver becomes fatty, as visceral fat around the organs often results from fat spill-off from the liver. Therefore, the best foods to reduce belly fat are those that lower insulin, decrease cortisol, or support liver health.

Ten foods that help reduce belly fat:

1\. Eggs

2\. Salmon

3\. Cod liver and cod liver oil

4\. Sauerkraut

5\. Cruciferous vegetables

6\. Hamburger

7\. Avocados

8\. Broccoli sprouts

9\. Asparagus

10\. Nutritional yeast (non-fortified)

Let's discuss water retention and weight gain in the context of the ketogenic diet.

Water retention, characterized by an excessive buildup of fluid in the circulatory system, can be influenced by various factors in the ketogenic diet. It's important to note that the weight gain observed is typically related to water rather than actual fat.

Let's discuss water retention and weight gain in the context of the ketogenic diet. Water retention, characterized by an excessive buildup of fluid in the circulatory system, can be influenced by various factors in the ketogenic diet. It's important to note that the weight gain observed is typically related to water rather than actual fat. Causes of Water Retention:

1\. Low Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): A deficiency in Vitamin B1 can lead to fluid retention and ankle edema. Adding nutritional yeast to your diet can help address this deficiency.

2\. Low Potassium: Inadequate vegetable consumption can result in low potassium levels. However, if you're still experiencing fluid retention despite consuming many vegetables, it could be due to an inability to digest excessive fiber. Leafy greens are an excellent source of potassium.

3\. Fiber: Both soluble and insoluble fiber can contribute to fluid retention. Fiber demands fluid to bulk up and facilitate the passage of stool through the digestive system.

4\. High Salt Intake: Excessive salt consumption can contribute to water retention.

5\. High Carbohydrate Intake: Consuming too many carbs is associated with fluid retention because carbohydrates have the ability to retain fluid.

It's crucial to understand that on the ketogenic diet, any observed weight gain is predominantly water weight, not fat. Adjusting your diet to address specific nutrient deficiencies and moderating fiber intake can help manage water retention and promote a healthier balance.

## What can help me to burn fat?

**Tired of feeling like your metabolism is working against you?** The truth is, your body might be more efficient than you think! To shed that stubborn fat, you need to ignite your body's energy-burning potential.

**The key lies in your mitochondria:** the powerhouses within your cells that convert food into stored energy. By triggering a process called mitochondrial uncoupling, you can shift those powerhouses to generate less stored energy and more heat – essentially "wasting" fuel and promoting fat burning.

**Resveratrol, a natural compound found in various fruits and plants, is your secret weapon.** It acts as a mitochondrial uncoupler, and studies show that incorporating a daily tablespoon of resveratrol powder can help reduce belly fat.

**But resveratrol isn't the only solution:** Ketones, cold therapy, exercise, fasting, green tea, saunas, and even Jacuzzis can also stimulate mitochondrial uncoupling.

**Maximize your results by avoiding factors that hinder this process:**

* **Limit excess calories:** Fuel your body efficiently, not excessively.
* **Stay active:** Combat the effects of aging and a sedentary lifestyle.
* **Minimize heavy metal exposure:** Protect your mitochondria from toxins.
* **Review your medications:** Discuss potential impacts with your doctor.

**By embracing these strategies, you can unlock your metabolism's full potential and finally conquer that stubborn fat.** Remember, it's not about having a slow metabolism; it's about harnessing your body's power to burn energy efficiently.

## What diets should I not follow?

**7 Diets That Can Harm Your Health and Weight Loss Goals**

Beware of these popular diets that often rely on heavily processed ingredients and can sabotage your health and metabolism:

1. **Junk Food Atkins:** The Atkins brand's shakes and bars are loaded with unhealthy ingredients like soy protein isolate, artificial flavors, and polydextrose.
2. **Jenny Craig:** Pre-made meals and the "anytime bar" contain soy protein isolate and synthetic starches like maltodextrin.
3. **Weightwatchers:** While focused on portion control, their Smart Ones brand includes meals with ultra-processed ingredients like soy protein isolates and soybean oil.
4. **Nutrisystem:** Marketed as diabetic-friendly, it uses ingredients like maltodextrin, which has a high glycemic index.
5. **Ideal Protein:** "Wheat protein isolate" is just another name for starch, a chain of sugars.
6. **Optifast:** This medically supervised program relies heavily on shakes, bars, and soups, often with maltodextrin as a primary ingredient.
7. **Medifast:** Despite being "scientifically designed," their products contain soy protein isolates, polydextrose, and other processed ingredients.

**The Bottom Line:**

These ultra-processed ingredients can disrupt your metabolism and contribute to health issues like diabetes and obesity.

**For sustainable weight loss, focus on whole foods and always read ingredient lists!** Don't be fooled by "keto-friendly" labels – prioritize real, nutritious food

## What exercise burns the most calories?

We're diving into the truth about calorie burning and the best exercises to maximize it.

It's crucial to understand that the type of calories you burn is directly linked to your diet. A sugary diet leads to burning sugar calories, while a sugar-free, higher-fat diet promotes fat burning.

Overtraining is a common pitfall, as it elevates cortisol levels, which can break down muscle protein. Instead, prioritize the health of your mitochondria – the powerhouses of your cells.

Healthy mitochondria are key to energy levels, recovery, and endurance. Factors like certain medications (e.g., statins) can weaken them, so it's important to support them through:

* Exercise with ample rest
* Maintaining thyroid health
* Building muscle mass
* Intermittent fasting
* Cold therapy
* Including meat in your diet

Mitochondrial health can be assessed through metabolomics testing. Additionally, addressing insulin resistance, which can harm mitochondria, is vital. Growth hormone can be beneficial in reducing insulin resistance, building muscle, and promoting fat burning.

Remember, a high-carb diet can hinder fat burning. It's essential to look beyond just calories and focus on overall fat loss, which is 85% diet and only 15% exercise.

For maximum calorie burning, opt for high-intensity exercises that engage multiple muscle groups.

Let's get started on optimizing your calorie-burning potential!

***

## What exercises can help me lose weight?

The type of calories you burn depends on your diet and exercise habits. If you consume sugar, you’re going to burn sugar calories. If you consume fat without sugar, you’ll burn fat. Avoid overtraining, which increases cortisol and can deplete protein from your muscles.

Calorie burning largely depends on the health of your mitochondria. Your energy levels, recovery time, and endurance can indicate whether your mitochondria are healthy. Certain medications like statins weaken the mitochondria.

To increase and strengthen your mitochondria, do the following:

• Exercise with adequate rest

• Focus on thyroid health

• Increase muscle mass

• Intermittent fasting

• Cold therapy

• Consume meat

Metabolomics can examine mitochondria to determine whether they’re getting enough fuel. Insulin resistance can destroy mitochondria. Growth hormone can reduce insulin resistance, help you build more muscle, and burn more fat. If your diet is too high in carbs, you won’t be able to burn fat. This is why it’s essential to look beyond calorie burning. Fat burning is only 15% exercise and 85% diet. The type of exercise that will help you burn the most calories is something that is high-intensity and involves as many muscles as possible.

## What exercises do you recommend for flabby arm fat?

**The main reason that people tend to have fat arms is the loss of collagen, which happens over a period of time as a person grows older. Out of all the hormones, the growth hormone tends to be the single most critical factor that is responsible for losing arm fat. In adults, the growth hormone controls factors such as fat burning, tightening muscles, protein synthesis, energy. The major causes of flabby arms are lower levels of growth hormone and high cortisol levels.**

To lose arm fat and avoid loose skin one must lower cortisol levels and raise the growth hormone. Lower cortisol levels can be achieved by low-intensity exercises (walking), sleeping, avoid stress, potassium foods, avoid sugar. Higher growth hormone can be achieved by high-intensity exercises, sleeping, proteins, avoid sugar.

**Loose skin normally stems from a loss of collagen, which occurs when the adrenal glands become stress.** This is common during and after menopause, primarily because the adrenal glands act as a backup gland for the ovaries. The buffer for cortisol is GH (Growth Hormone) and as GH drops, there is nothing left to counter the bad effects of cortisol.

**LOWER CORTISOL**

1\. Low-intensity exercise

2\. Increase sleep

3\. Support adrenal gland

4\. Avoid stress

5\. Increase potassium

6\. Increase B vitamins

7\. Avoid sugar

**RAISE GROWTH HORMONE**

1\. High-intensity exercise

2\. Increase sleep

3\. Increase some protein (not more than 6 ounces per meal)

4\. Intermittent fasting - only 3 meals per day - no snacks

5\. Decrease Cortisol and insulin

6\. Support the liver

***

## What exercises do you recommend for love handles?

Love handles result from fat accumulation in the liver that spills off in and around the organs in your mid-section.

The primary cause of love handles is a diet that’s high in sugar and refined carbs. Sugar and refined carbs cause high insulin, which causes stored fat. But, stress and a lack of sleep also cause high insulin and lead to love handle.

To get rid of love handles, you need to get on a Healthy Keto diet, do intermittent fasting, lower your stress, improve your sleep, and start exercising. The exercises I’m going to share with you are intense and will focus on your core to get rid of love handles.

**Exercises to get rid of love handles fast:**

1\. Side planks

2\. Bicycle crunches

3\. Russian twists

4\. Mountain climbers

5\. Woodchoppers

6\. Bulgarian bag

***

## What fat is considered dangerous?

Fat storage is a survival mechanism, but there is a limitation to how much fuel can be stored. Once your body is out of storage, fat is placed around the organs. This type of fat is called visceral fat. If visceral fat is stored for too long, it spills into your organs. This is called ectopic fat. The good news is that when you burn fat, this is the first to go.

It’s not the number of calories that causes this excess fat storage; it’s the type of calories. Alcohol and ultra-processed foods like high fructose corn syrup cause visceral fat and liver fat. Chronic stress can even cause your body to turn things into sugar. Poor sleep can increase cortisol and visceral fat. Certain medications, such as steroids, antibiotics, antidepressants, and anti-anxiety drugs, can also increase visceral fat.

Seed oils, refined sugars, and starches in the diet directly contribute to mitochondrial damage and visceral fat. To lose visceral fat, you need to eliminate ultra-processed calories. Instead, consume nutrient-dense foods like red meat, eggs, and fish.

HIIT exercise is the best exercise for burning fat. HIIT involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise with rest. Weight training can help reduce belly fat by increasing muscle mass. Long walks can help reduce belly fat by burning fat and reducing stress.

Vitamin B1 helps reduce stress and improve sleep.

Nutritional yeast is one of the best sources of B1.

Vitamin D can also help you lose weight. If you can’t go out in the sun, take at least 10,000 IU of vitamin D3. Make sure to take magnesium with vitamin D3 because it allows for vitamin D's proper function and helps improve sleep. Fasting also helps to burn fat fast by reducing insulin spikes.

***

## What is the hidden cause for belly fat?

If you undergo a lot of stress, whether mental or physical, without being able to recover efficiently that can cause belly fat. This is because your adrenals (stress regulating glands) produce cortisol to help with stress. Cortisol can break down your muscles and store it as fat in your belly and glutes.

The solution is to support your adrenals and address your stress directly. Those can normalize the level of cortisol (not too low and not too high). Additionally, improving your sleep is going to be very beneficial for your adrenals and fat burning.

**Remedies:**

* Consume vitamin B1
* benfotiamine
* nutritional yeast
* Improve your sleep (take naps if needed)
* Take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes)
* Regularly exercise (but don’t overtrain)
* Avoid things/people that stress you out
* Consume vitamin D
* Consume adaptogens
* Consume calcium
* Consume potassium
* Consume magnesium
* You can also use this Massage Tool
* Do these acupressure techniques with it
* You can also take Adrenal Support Supplement
* You can also take Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula
* General remedies to help with belly fat:
  * do reverse sit-ups exercise
  * consume purified bile salts
  * consume fermented vegetables
  * consume probiotics
  * consume apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water)
  * consume potassium
  * consume chromium
  * consume MCT oil
  * do HIIT exercises with high amounts of rest between sets

## What is the most effective and fastest way to get rid of double chin?

Ready to say goodbye to that turkey neck? Today, I'm sharing four simple exercises that can tighten loose skin and strengthen the muscles under your chin.

As we get older, it's common to develop loose skin, particularly in areas like the neck that don't get much exercise. But there's good news! By regularly performing these exercises, you can see a noticeable difference.

The secret lies in the fascia, a connective tissue beneath your skin that plays a crucial role in head and jaw movement. These exercises target both the superficial and deep layers of fascia, promoting a firmer, more toned neck.

We'll start by working the muscle responsible for opening your jaw, followed by an exercise that activates the superficial fascia. Next, we'll deeply stretch the fascia, and finally, we'll perform a head flexion exercise to strengthen it even further.

Remember, the key to success is consistency! By incorporating these exercises into your routine, you can effectively combat loose skin and achieve a more youthful neckline. So let's get started and say farewell to that turkey neck!

## What is the most effective way to lose weight?

### **A Better Strategy for Weight Loss**

Strategy is a higher level thing you do to get an advantage over things. Belly fat is not a weight problem; it is a high cortisol problem.

Diets don’t help with this. _**Diets don’t lower cortisol; they lower calories**_ so they create stress and belly fat is held there for survival mechanism\*\*.\*\*

> One of the _**purposes of the body is holding fat in your belly which protects you against**_ _**starvation**_.

What’s starvation? That’s a diet.

Every time you deprive yourself of food and you lower your calories too much, it won’t help the cortisol. The other thing you need to _**be careful with is to do too much exercise.**_ You may want to do long walks instead. Exercise is a type of stress that can aggravate the belly.

***

### **What to do?**

Cortisol is a hormone from the adrenal that is jacked up way too high. It is an overactive gland.

We have to realize that the gland is triggered by all stresses. The biggest stressor are other people. Avoid stressful people. They will aggravate the adrenals.

> _**Try to minimize the amount of exposure**_ _you have to stressful personalities._

If you are in a relationship or have an aggravating boss, I know it’s difficult so you have to counteract by doing things that are anti-stress like sleeping longer.

If you have sleep problems, you can use acupressure or my "_**Adrenal Fatigue Formula".**_ There are no side effects.

Acupressure will literally _**pull stress out of your body and help you sleep**_. You can have it done right here in my office or do it yourself.

## What stops me from losing belly fat?

**One of the top things that will stop you from losing belly fat is alcohol consumption. You may have heard of keto-friendly wine or that pure alcohol is keto-friendly. Pure alcohol is not a carb or sugar and doesn’t directly increase your blood sugar or insulin. However, indirectly, it can create severe insulin resistance.**

Liver cells treat alcohol like poison and try to get rid of it. The toxicity of the alcohol injures the liver cells and can even kill them. During this process, you develop fat in the liver cells, which can lead to a fatty liver.

**With a fatty liver, you can also experience inflammation and scarring in the liver.** Chronic inflammation and scarring can then cause cirrhosis and increase your risk of liver cancer and other liver problems. Alcohol also blocks your ability to burn fat. Don’t expect to burn fat for 48 to 72 hours after alcohol consumption. It’s a source of empty calories and depletes important nutrients.

You’ve probably heard that there are certain benefits of drinking alcohol in moderation. But, recently, they’ve found that was only a marketing tactic, and there are no benefits to drinking alcohol.

**Alcohol also has negative effects on other parts of the body, including:**

• The brain

• The endocrine system

• The gut microbiome

• The heart

• Estrogen production in men (increases estrogen and decreases testosterone)

It’s crucial to realize the negative effects of alcohol and consider the real reasons you’re drinking alcohol, like stress. Many natural things can help you reduce stress. If you can’t give up alcohol, try diluting it with sparkling water. If you take milk thistle before drinking, it can help protect the liver against poison and can help support the liver. Kombucha tea with low amounts of sugar is also a great alternative to alcohol and gives you a nice, relaxed feeling.

## What to do before, during and after a workout?

It’s no surprise that there is an association between a lack of exercise and many different health concerns. One of the biggest benefits of exercise is that it increases the mitochondria. Various diseases are related to mitochondrial dysfunction, including cancer. Exercise also increases stem cells, which can turn into just about anything your body needs.

Exercise helps reduce stress, balance blood sugar levels, supports sleep, and has many other incredible health benefits.

**The four variables of exercise:**

1\. Duration

2\. Intensity

3\. Recovery

4\. Frequency

You need to give your body time to recover, not just between workouts but also during workouts. It's important to rest between four to five minutes between each set. This will allow your body to replenish ATP and help you train with maximum power. Intensity is key with exercise. Focus on higher intensity with more sets and lots of recovery. Many of the benefits of exercise also occur one to two days later during sleep.

Just a small amount of refined carbs can nullify the benefits of exercise. However, if you have diabetes or insulin resistance and are trying to build muscle on the keto diet, you can increase your carbs to 50 grams per day. The type of carbohydrates you can consume are berries and protein.

Other essential tips to increase the benefits from your workouts and support recovery:

1\. Do high-intensity interval training (HIIT)

2\. Come to a full stop vs. active recovery during HIIT workouts

3\. Put more focus on eccentric motions (elongating the muscles)

4\. Do contrasting therapy after you exercise

5\. Build up to exercising during a fasting state (eat one to two hours after a workout)

6\. Consume enough salt and electrolytes (consume electrolyte powder if needed)

7\. Consume red meat, eggs, and high-quality cheese

8\. Don’t exercise over soreness and focus on sleep instead

9\. Take copper before bed to enhance sleep

***

## What type of protein works the best for weight loss?

Organ meats have amazing amounts of vitamins, even more than vegetables! Next would be wild-caught fish, pasture-raised eggs, grass-fed beef, organic pork, grass-fed, organic chicken and turkey, then lastly protein powders.

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/what-type-of-protein-is-best-for-weight-loss-drberg)

***

## What will happen when you exercise for weight loss?

The belly is an indirect indicator of the amount of insulin there is in the body. Insulin is the fat-storing hormone that is triggered by various things. It stores fat around the midsection and the liver. Exercise as a tool for weight loss will not lower insulin to any significant degree.

What to Do?

• Cut the Carbs – like brown rice, pasta, wine, fruits

• Intermittent fasting - Decrease the frequency of meals. Stop snacking before or after your workout and work out in a fasting state.

***

## What's missing in the counting calories theory?

Merely a matter of calories in and calories out is one concept of weight loss. The missing piece in this concept is the “hormonal effect” of your macros (carbohydrates, fats, and protein). Different macros respond to hormones differently, and that explains why there is a huge difference in how the body responds to calories.

## What's the best way for a vegan to lose weight?

This is based on the insulin index, which involves several actions of eating fewer meals and keeping insulin low. Reducing your sugars can then put you into ketosis (ketogenic diet).

## When do I change my workout program?

Training in general or doing some type of workout decreases the result if you are doing the same thing because your body will adapt to it and then it stops adapting.

There is a thing called muscle confusion and that is basically the idea of changing your workouts to keep your body in a constant confusion. But if you also change your routine too frequently and you don’t let your body fully adapt, your gains will also be limited because you are not reaching the maximum potential of that work out.

**Recommendation:**

• Do the same workout for 3 to 4 weeks (example: 3 times a week with 3 different workouts) until your body actually adapts and gets used to it, then change it.

***

## Which is worse: a high carb diet or snacking for weight loss?

Snacking is actually worse than a high-carb diet when it comes to weight loss. Both increase insulin, but frequent snacking keeps insulin levels elevated throughout the day, preventing fat loss. For example, when I stopped snacking, even on seemingly healthy options like apples with peanut butter, I lost a significant amount of weight. Research has shown that snacking is a major contributor to obesity, more so than even high-carb diets.

Historically, people ate three meals a day with minimal snacking, and obesity rates were much lower. The modern habit of frequent snacking keeps insulin levels high, giving the pancreas no time to recover. This constant stimulation of insulin can be detrimental to your health.

Intermittent fasting is a powerful alternative that simplifies your eating routine and reduces hunger over time, making it an effective strategy for both weight loss and improving overall health.

***

## Which is worse for your weight: inactivity or junk food?

Junk food is far more detrimental to weight management than inactivity. While exercise contributes only about 15% to weight loss, diet plays a much larger role, accounting for 85%. So, while inactivity does have an impact, the effect of consuming junk food is significantly greater on your overall weight.

***

## Which supplements can help relieve sore muscles after a workout?

The secret is vitamin E. Watch what happens to your soreness, it'll go way down, because vitamin E is necessary for improving repair, decreasing inflammation, and decreasing scar tissue, so it's good for a fatty liver. But it's definitely good after you exercise to reduce soreness.

***

## Why am I losing inches but not weight?

**There is nothing more frustrating than doing everything right with keto and intermittent fasting, and still not losing weight.**

**Even if you're losing inches but not losing weight, the ketogenic diet is still working:**

• If you're losing inches

• If your hunger is going away

• If you're not craving anymore

• If you have more energy

A slow metabolism really is insulin resistance. Insulin is an anabolic hormone. If insulin is not working, you're not going to have the anabolic effect. As soon as you do keto and intermittent fasting, you're going to fix insulin resistance. Once you fix insulin resistance, you're going to absorb more protein. Protein weighs more than fat per the same volume. This means, initially, you will lose inches but not weight.

**This is because you're:**

• Absorbing protein

• Getting more muscle mass

• Fixing atrophy

If you're not losing weight on keto, keep in mind that it is working. You're getting healthier. You have to get healthy to lose weight, not lose weight to get healthy.

## Why are there no fat people in Colorado? Connection with Vitamin D

**Why are there no fat people in Colorado?**

Areas of the US with higher Black, Latino, and American Indian populations have higher obesity rates. The elderly have higher rates of obesity as well. People with darker skin tones have more melanin, making it more difficult to absorb vitamin D. It also becomes more difficult to absorb vitamin D as you age.

**Chronic vitamin D deficiency can lead to obesity.**

The more overweight a person is, the more vitamin D they need. The characteristics of metabolic syndrome align perfectly with the symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency can create inflammation, high blood glucose, high blood pressure, and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the driving factor behind obesity. If you have insulin resistance, you have too much insulin. Insulin is a fat-storing hormone that causes you to gain weight. Vitamin D helps keep insulin sensitive, but vitamin D doesn’t work well if you have insulin resistance.

**Colorado is a high-altitude state situated several thousand feet above sea level.**

This means it’s closer to the sun. The closer you are to the sun, the more vitamin D you’re exposed to. Vitamin D exposure in Colorado could be the most critical variable influencing people's weight.

## Why can you not lose weight during menopause?

It's not just weight, it's atrophy. Menopausal atrophy is adrenal stress. This is higher amounts of cortisol. Atrophy is a major problem as you are losing muscle fiber and increased inflammation. This can be frustrating because you may be doing more exercise and eating better than those around you, but still, things are slow, however, the problem may not be all weight - it could be atrophy. This is called menopausal atrophy.

Make sure you do not overtrain with exercise.

* Ensuring your sleep is better.
*   Inactivity is another problem.

## Why can't I lose belly fat after menopause?

When a woman goes through menopause, their ovaries no longer produce or release eggs. This big change leads to a cascade of other changes. The ovaries also make hormones, which means a woman in menopause will have lower hormone levels. However, when this happens, the adrenal glands are supposed to act as the backup system for the ovaries. The adrenal glands make all of the hormones that the ovaries make.

If the adrenal glands are strong and stable when a woman is going into menopause, they may experience fewer symptoms. It’s not normal to experience symptoms of menopause unless there’s a problem with the adrenal glands. Another part of the body we need to focus on is the parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system is the recovery system of the body. It influences your sleep and ability to recover. Fat burning occurs in the recovery phase.

Exercising your parasympathetic nervous system will help reduce cortisol, support sleep, and get rid of belly fat. In order to strengthen your parasympathetic nervous system, it’s crucial to increase the time you rest in between your reps and sets of exercise, as well as the days of exercise. You have to make sure you don’t overtrain and give your body a chance to completely recover and reset.

**How to lose belly fat after menopause:**

1\. Do high-intensity exercises with longer rest periods

2\. Don’t overtrain

3\. Don’t train over soreness

4\. Focus on getting more sleep

5\. Take advantage of chiropractic care, massage therapy, or physical therapy

6\. Consume omega-3 fatty acids

7\. Take DHEA

8\. Go on a low-carb diet with intermittent fasting

9\. Get plenty of magnesium, choline, vitamin B1, and vitamin D

10\. Try lemon balm, passionflower, or ashwagandha

## Why can't people lose weight?

At 18, most people can burn fat easily. But, once a person gets into their forties or older, they start having a more difficult time with weight loss. So, what happens? Well, at age 18, you have the most fat-burning hormones that you will ever have. After 18, these hormones decrease.

The problem with taking hormones to combat this problem is that your body will start to make even fewer hormones, and it will become dependent on the hormones you're taking.

You're also born with fat-making hormones that peak around age 18. But, the fat-making hormones don't decrease—they stay the same. This makes trying to lose weight the same way you did when you were 18 impossible. These fat-making hormones are really what's keeping your last little bit of fat-burning hormones from working. So, instead of taking hormones, why don't we just stop triggering the fat-making hormones?

Insulin is the hormone that regulates blood sugars. Insulin is triggered by sugar, and it's a fat-making hormone. Cortisol is a stress hormone that's triggered by stress, and it's also a fat-making hormone.

**How to help lower fat-making hormones to lose weight:** • Avoid sugar • Reduce your stress

## Why do I crave sweets after a workout?

You crave sweets after a workout because your body is depleting its glucose stores and hasn't yet adapted to burning fat for fuel. It typically takes one to three months to become fully fat-adapted, where your body efficiently uses fat reserves during exercise. Until then, your body relies on sugar for energy, leading to post-workout sugar cravings.

***

## Why do I have a sudden and rapid weight gain?

**Sudden changes in weight have nothing to do with losing or gaining fat. Let's say you start keto, and the next day you are four pounds lighter—this is due to fluid loss, not fat loss.**

As your body stores fat in the form of glycogen, you also store water. For every one gram of fat, your body stores three grams of water. High-carb diets cause you to retain even more water because your levels of stored sodium increase. Those with a lot of fluid retention often see the fluid build up around their feet and ankles.

**The best indicator of success on keto is if your cravings are going away—are you less hungry between meals? If you can't go without food for a few hours, then you know there's a lot of room to improve your diet.**

**The best natural diuretics for getting rid of excess fluids are:**

• Ketones

• Dandelion

• Uva Ursi

• Horsetail

• Celery

• Potassium

## Why "everything in moderation" method doesn't work to build a healthy body?

Why eating everything in moderation doesn’t work for weight loss or creating a healthy body:

1\. The carbs aren’t low enough (moderation is subjective)

2\. Many people have insulin resistance

3\. It doesn’t consider genetics

4\. It includes addictive foods

5\. It includes refined foods

6\. Eating stimulates insulin

***

## Why is having a weight loss goal a bad idea?

**Your weight loss goal is setting you up for failure. I’ll explain by giving you several concepts, so you may want to take notes.**

First, the difference between muscle and fat. One pound of fat takes up more space than one pound of muscle. Overweight people have less muscle than fat. A keto and intermittent fasting program will solve your stubborn weight and metabolism issue. When you start the program, you’ll lose fat and increase muscle because you’ll trigger certain muscle-building hormones as you train your body to use fat for fuel. You’ll also lose water weight. When you use up the stored sugar in your body, you’ll release the significant amount of water that’s attached to the glycogen.

Most people who go on any weight loss program lose water weight for the first one to two weeks. But that weight loss isn’t consistent. Plus, when you start Keto and intermittent fasting you may or may not lose overall weight while you gain muscle. If you only focus on losing fat and not gaining muscle, you end up thinner but flabby and weak. You also may or may not lose inches. Most of the time you will, but you may plateau because you’re gaining muscle. Losing weight isn’t linear. It isn’t consistent when you’re gaining muscle along with losing fat. But this is what you want to develop a strong, healthy body. You don’t want your muscles to atrophy, although many people’s muscles do, especially women going through menopause.

Plus, the more muscle you have, the better your metabolism. Muscle burns more calories. You want to make sure the calories being burned are from fat, not sugar. Lower your carb intake, and your body will burn fat. Hormonally, the difference between men and women comes down to two different hormones. Men have more testosterone. Women have more estrogen, which creates the fat layer around the female body. This is why men lose weight faster. They’re not dealing with the amount of estrogen that causes their body to create a fat layer. You see why I recommend not making weight loss your main goal. You’ll most likely just get frustrated and discouraged. Instead, have several goals: inches lost, weight loss, health improvement, and a strength goal. Weight loss isn’t the only measure of your success.

## Why is menopause making me fat?

The ovaries make several hormones called estrogen and progesterone. An average woman releases 400 eggs and when going through menopause, the ovaries basically stop producing eggs. Both hormones decrease but the ratio of estrogen is still much higher than progesterone leaving someone in the state of estrogen dominance.

The estrogen dominance will trigger another hormone, Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone (CRH) which is basically a hormone that communicates to the pituitary. Cortisol is the main hormone that creates the problem. He also talks about the excess cortisol being very catabolic.

## Why should I stop snacking at night?

Snacking late at night raises insulin thus prevents losing weight. Having higher insulin will prevent losing your belly. Make sure you do not have these snacks available in your space. In your last meal, to prevent snacking, add more fat to your meal.

## Why sit ups are bad exercise to reduce belly fat?

Sit ups are actually the worst exercise to help reduce belly fat. This goes against so many philosophies. But, when you think about it, you’re getting the abdominal muscles contracted, but that skin is actually getting looser. I’m going to show you a much better way to lose belly fat fast, and it’s called reversed sit ups.

While standing, you want to tighten your abdominal muscles and stretch backward and then forward. You’ll want to do this about 25 times, rest for about 3-4 minutes, and then do another set of 25. Try doing 3 sets every day. If you have lower back pain, you want to go really light, like maybe just 3 sets of 5-10. You can also lay on your stomach and arch up.

Doing regular sit ups can give you an imbalance and lead to back pain. This is a fantastic exercise for loose skin in the lower part of your stomach that’s really difficult to tighten.
