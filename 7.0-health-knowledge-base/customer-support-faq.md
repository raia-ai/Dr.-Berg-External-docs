#### **Can You Still Eat Your Favorite Foods on a Keto Diet?**

When you commit to a ketogenic diet, you will have to eliminate sugars and limit carbs from your daily meals. To a person who’s partial to sweet things, this can be a hard sacrifice to make.

Luckily, there are ways to still enjoy your favorite pizza or cookies without feeling any guilt at all!

Below are a few of these amazing keto-friendly recipes meant to provide alternatives to your favorite snacks.

#### **1. The Healthiest Bread in the World**

Eating keto-friendly bread is possible with this recipe. It uses cauliflower flour instead of the regular white flour.

This keto-friendly bread recipe is packed with fiber, phytonutrients, and plenty of flavor.

**Phytonutrients Definition:** Plant-produced chemicals believed to be beneficial in preventing diseases in humans.

Add in grated and salted cauliflower into a blender with eggs. Pour into a pan and then, bake until golden.

If you want, you can also use grated cheese instead of salt to give [this keto-friendly bread](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-healthiest-bread-in-the-world) a creamy, cheesy kick. Top it with avocado or your favorite keto-friendly fruits like preserved raspberries.

#### **2. Delicious Pancakes Using Almond Flour**

If you’re one to enjoy pancakes in the morning, you will love this guilt-free, [keto-friendly pancake recipe](https://www.drberg.com/blog/totally-legal-amazing-pancakes).

Mix together almond flour and coconut or olive oil in a bowl. Glaze it with a [keto-friendly maple syrup](https://www.drberg.com/blog/keto-friendly-maple-syrup) and enjoy!

#### **3. The Healthiest Pizza in the World**

Cauliflower flour makes a really good alternative for the carbohydrate- rich white flour. In this [keto-friendly pizza recipe](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-healthiest-pizza-in-the-world), it makes up the crust together with cheese and eggs.

You don’t need to use flour, add salt (since cheese contains fat and salt), or put in sugar. Use homemade tomato sauce or look for one that has low to no sugar added.

#### **4. Amazing Low-Carb Waffles**

![Waffle on a plate | Guilt-Free and Keto Friendly Snacks You Should Try](https://drberg-uploads.imgix.net/articles/waffle-breakfast-food-morning-dish-keto-friendly-snacks-pb.jpg)

Like the pancake recipe, use almond flour for this low-carb, [keto-friendly waffle](https://www.drberg.com/blog/amazing-low-carb-waffles). You won’t have to worry about the syrup you’ll use either.

#### **5. Gluten-Free Breadsticks**

You can still commit to a perfect keto diet even when you crave breadsticks. This [low carb, gluten-free version](https://www.drberg.com/blog/low-carb-bread-sticks) makes use of mozzarella cheese, cream cheese, eggs, and psyllium husk.

#### **6. Amazing Low-Carb Pecan Pie**

With a crust made from almond flour, butter from grass-fed cows, and organic eggs, you can bake your own healthy, [low carb pecan pie](https://www.drberg.com/blog/amazing-low-carb-pecan-pie). Sweeten the filling with keto-friendly maple syrup, and you’ll have the most amazing pecan pie for dessert.

#### **7. Guilt-Free Shortbread Cookies**

To make this easy keto-friendly snack, you can use almond flour, natural sweetener, and unsalted butter. It follows the same steps as the usual [recipe for shortbread cookies](https://www.drberg.com/blog/keto-friendly-shortbread-cookies) but with healthier ingredients -- and they’ll still taste as good.

#### **8. Keto-friendly Ice Cream**

![Smiling beautiful woman eating ice cream | Guilt-Free and Keto Friendly Snacks You Should Try](https://drberg-uploads.imgix.net/articles/woman-sitting-at-table-holding-ice-cream-keto-friendly-snacks-px.jpg)

If you own an ice cream maker, you can make this keto-friendly snack at home.

For [this ice cream recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC4jrAIWlmI), instead of using full cream milk, use coconut or unsweetened almond milk. Substitute refined sugar with erythritol sweetener instead.

**Erythritol Definition**: A natural sweetener extracted from lichens and algae.

**RELATED:** [**Homemade Mayonnaise**](https://www.drberg.com/blog/homemade-mayonnaise)

#### **9. Amazing Spiced Nut Mix**

Nuts are great snacks for your keto diet. That’s because they contain protein, fat, and very little carbohydrates.

Bake this keto-friendly snack using our [Spiced Nut Mix recipe](https://www.drberg.com/blog/spiced-nut-mix).

#### **10. Whipped Cream with No Sugar**

[Whipped cream as a healthy snack](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-make-whipped-cream)? Yes, that’s right.

You can take this snack right after a meal -- just with the meal and not in between meals. You can add flavor by adding in keto-friendly caramel or vanilla into the mixture.

Keep it in the refrigerator for when you want a keto-friendly snack.

#### **11. Chocolate Keto Fat Bomb**

These [chocolate keto fat bombs](https://www.drberg.com/blog/amazing-chocolate-keto-fat-bombs) are not only low in carbohydrates but are also vegan and easy to make -- you won’t need to use an oven either.

You’ll only need nut butter, coconut oil, and cocoa powder. Mix them together until smooth, then freeze in an ice cube tray.

#### **12. Low Carb Peanut Butter Cups**

![Peanut butter cups | Guilt-Free and Keto Friendly Snacks You Should Try](https://drberg-uploads.imgix.net/articles/homemade-peanut-butter-cups-on-rustic-keto-friendly-snacks-ss.jpg)

You can recreate commercial peanut butter cups with unsweetened peanut butter, almond flour, sugar-free chocolate chips, and coconut oil with [this recipe](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-make-peanut-butter-cups).

#### **13. Keto-Friendly Chocolate Chip Cookies**

By using almond flour for the cookie dough, you can turn your favorite chocolate chip cookies into keto-friendly snacks. [Try this recipe](https://www.drberg.com/blog/keto-friendly-chocolate-chip-cookies) to make keto-friendly nibbles.

#### **14. Chocolate Mousse**

Use gelatin, unsweetened cocoa powder, natural sweetener, and keto-friendly whipping cream to make this delicious chocolate mousse. Enjoy [chocolate mousse without the guilt](https://www.drberg.com/blog/low-carb-chocolate-mousse-pudding).

#### **15. Delicious Candied Pecans**

If you’re getting tired of spiced nuts, try [candied pecans](https://www.drberg.com/blog/candied-pecan-recipe) to sweeten things up.

You can use keto-friendly maple syrup, and add lightly toasted sesame seeds to enhance the pecan’s flavor.

Mix sesame seeds and your sweetener in a food processor until fine. Then, beat egg whites until peaks form.

Put in the sesame seed powder and pecans, and fold in the egg white. Bake for 45 minutes and allow to cool before storing them as you please.

#### **16. Amazing Chocolate Seed Treat**

Enjoy [this guilt-free treat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDp03fOlnSM\&t=40s) that has just the right amount of chocolate. It uses sunflower and pumpkin seeds which are both high on protein but don"t irritate the gall bladder.

![Keto-Friendly Pleasure Foods Infographic | Keto-Friendly Snacks You Can Enjoy Without the Guilt | Dr. Berg Blog](https://drberg-uploads.imgix.net/articles/20190318-Dr.Berg-Keto%20Friendly%20Pleasure%20Foods.jpg)

You don’t have to give up all the desserts and ketogenic-friendly snacks you love to follow your diet. Just look for substitutes for those high-carb and high-sugar ingredients.

**QA Tips – Saying No Without Saying “No”**

These responses help acknowledge the customer’s concern, explain the reason, and offer an alternative whenever possible:

1. **Acknowledge + Redirect** – “I understand you were hoping for a refund beyond the 30-day policy. While we can’t offer that, what I can do is \_\_\_.”
2. **Offer an Alternative** – “Although that product is currently out of stock, we do have \_\_\_ which contains similar ingredients and benefits.”
3. **Policy Sandwich** – “Our policy is that refunds are only applicable to the first purchase of a product. The reason for this is to ensure fairness to all customers. What I can suggest instead is \_\_\_.”
4. **Empathy + Solution** – “I understand how important it is for your order to arrive on time. While we can’t guarantee exact delivery dates, I can help track your order and provide updates until it arrives.”
5. **Conditional Yes** – “That’s possible if the order has not yet been processed in our fulfillment center. Let’s check the status so we can see if we can make that happen.”
6. **Explain the Why** – “For your safety and security, we prefer that you process the payment on your end. I can guide you over the phone until the order is complete.”
7. **Future Opportunity** – “We don’t have that flavor available right now, but I’ll pass your feedback to our product team so they can consider it for the future.”
8. **Upgrade Suggestion** – “That promotion has ended, but we can check if you have enough points to use so you can save.”
9. **Redirect to Best Option** – “That specific discount code can’t be applied to subscriptions, but I can help you switch to a one-time purchase so you can use it.”
10. **Reinforce the Positive** – “We’re unable to add an item once the order has been processed, but I can help you place a new order and waive the shipping fee for you.”

_Reminder: Listen to understand the customer’s situation before responding._

## Minutes Of The Meeting August 4, 2025

**Handling International Order Edits**

* For domestic orders, item removals can be coordinated with ProPack and refunded via Shopify.
* For international orders, **do not request item removal after submission to ProPack**—this can cause invoice discrepancies. Instead, recommend full cancellation if needed.

**Work Item Closure Timelines**

* Wait at least **48 hours** after sending an email before closing a work item (unless the customer confirms resolution).
* Closing too early may trigger a survey before the issue is resolved, potentially resulting in negative feedback.

**Call Efficiency Reminders**

* If the customer's profile is auto-loaded (via saved number), **verify basic details and go straight to the order history**—no need to ask for order ID if it's visible.
* This helps avoid delays and improves the customer experience.

**Using No-Response Templates**

* Ava and Cathy shared QR templates labeled “no response” for closing unresolved tickets politely.
* Jane's QR emphasizes service tone and invites customers to respond again if needed.
* Agents can personalize or combine templates into a CS-wide version. Feedback welcomed for standardizing this.

**Ending Calls Properly**

* Avoid lingering after ending a call. Use **30-45 seconds max** to wrap up if needed, but once the customer hangs up, **end the call promptly**.
* Use **ACW time** (after-call work) for extended notes or follow-ups.
* Process refunds or replacements while still on the call when possible.

**New Product Updates and Internal Info Caution**

* New products may arrive in coming months—**do not give customers specific dates** or mention internal updates (e.g., label printing).
* Use safe language: "We’re hoping to have it back by the end of the quarter."
* Liquid D3K2 is expected, but **exact launch date is still unknown**. Updates will be sent via email and general announcements.

**GoCertify Program Clarifications**

* Customers receive their **one-time discount code** after uploading verification.
* CS does **not have admin access** to confirm submissions. If needed, customers can re-upload or contact GoCertify directly.
* Encourage customers to check for other discount options (e.g., rewards, spin-the-wheel, email promos).
* One-time discount is **per category** (e.g., healthcare, senior, student). Multiple categories = multiple one-time codes.

**Buy with Prime Updates and Issues**

* Zinc orders may be **delayed** due to Amazon restocking. Orders should resume fulfillment by mid-week.
* Multi-item orders may be split between Amazon and ProPack. Track accordingly.
* Example delays seen in Hawaii—monitor delivery estimates and advise accordingly.

**Subscription Cancellations**

* Common reason: customers have **excess product on hand**.
* Send customers a link to their **subscription dashboard** for self-management.
* If the order was canceled, also ensure the **subscription is canceled** to avoid future confusion.

**Decreased Domestic Order Status Inquiries**

* Previously a top work item category, now no longer in the top 3.
* Team suspects recent improvements in tracking (possibly due to new DHL integration) as the reason.

**Website Delivery Time Visibility**

* Confirmed that delivery estimates appear during checkout for domestic orders.
* If customers ask, walk them through checkout or advise where to view timeframes.

**Buy with Prime Processing Notes**

* Some products (e.g., blood sugar support) may not route to ProPack properly.
* Split shipments or separate fulfillment timelines may apply to multi-item orders.
* Follow up on any anomalies seen with product routing or delays.

***

## Minutes Of The Meeting July 17, 2025

**Adverse Reaction Log usage reminder**

* Reminder to keep using the **Adverse Reaction Log** for any product-related complaints or reactions.

This data is reviewed by Steve and Maria, and it’s important to complete all required fields in the Excel file. Even if the report is over 30 days old, a refund may still be processed—just make sure the full procedure from the KB article is followed.

***

**II. Performance Stats Update**

* **Missed calls** will now be counted under **outbound call stats** and no longer reflected as a separate stat in the overall performance numbers.

This avoids double credit and ensures more accurate reporting. A quick audit confirmed that missed calls were already being credited under outbound.

***

**III. Feedback Survey & Call Closings**

* Reminder to be intentional about **adding survey reminders** during call closings.

The company’s goal is to reach 25–30% feedback response rate. Closing spiels should be warm, concise, and encourage customers to respond to the one-question survey sent after the call. See Section VI for examples shared by the team.

***

**IV. System & Process Updates**

**Replacement Processing & Expiration Management**

* When sending replacements, manually edit the **expiration or lot number** in propack before the item is shipped. This only applies if the order is still in “Accepted” status. If it’s not, reach out to the warehouse to request that they revert the order to accepted so edits can be made. Wait for the replacement to sync with ProPack (about 10 minutes) before making updates.

**Amazon Reshipments**

* Tag **CS Leadership** (Ava, Jane, or Cathy) for Amazon reshipments. Do **not tag Roxanna M.** anymore.

These requests will now be entered manually in NetSuite by the CS team for faster turnaround. The same “Amazon Reshipment” work item can be used, just assign it to one of the current processors moving forward.

***

**V. QA & CS Best Practices Reminders**

**Missing Items (Undamaged Packages)**

* If a customer reports missing items but the package is **not damaged or tampered with**, send an email to PROPACK. Include the **order number**, **replacement number** (if already processed), and a list of the **missing items**. This allows PROPACK to issue a refund to the company.

**Order & Refund Calls**

* For phone orders:
* Always verify the customer’s **email address** and **shipping address**.
* Inform the customer of the **expected delivery timeframe** (3–8 business days).
* For refunds:
* Clearly state the **refund timeline** (typically 3–5 business days depending on the bank).
* Let the customer know they can check with their bank or contact us if the refund hasn’t posted by then.

**First Contact Resolution (FCR)**

* Always aim to resolve issues on the **first customer interaction**.

Offer appropriate options (refund/replacement) immediately if the issue is valid. If images are needed, the core resolution should still be provided upfront. Avoid responses like “we’ll check with the warehouse” unless truly needed, and make sure subscriptions are cancelled during the same call if the refund is related to an unwanted recurring order.

**Account Notes & Documentation**

* When customers use **multiple email addresses**, make sure to **notate both accounts** in CRM. This avoids confusion in future tickets or calls and ensures all relevant data is accessible.

**Troubleshooting Resource Links**

* If a customer reaches out about **broken or missing links** from Dr. Berg’s website or YouTube channel, check the content yourself before escalating. Many customers get confused when Dr. Berg references a “link below” that may not be there or doesn’t work. Escalate only when necessary and after verifying the issue.

**System Issue Validation**

* Before escalating system concerns (e.g., CRM issues or loading errors), **test across multiple browsers or channels**. Confirm the issue internally before submitting a critical ticket or tagging IT.

***

**VI. Sample Call Closings**

Here are some of the common call closing lines shared by the team:

* “Thank you for calling Dr. Berg Nutritionals. You’ll receive a one-question email survey after this call—we’d really appreciate your feedback!”
* “Your order confirmation and tracking details will be emailed to you shortly. And once we hang up, a short survey will be sent to your inbox.”
* “If you could take a moment to complete the survey after this call, it really helps us out. Thank you again for choosing Dr. Berg!”

Friendly touches such as “Have a great day!” or “Enjoy your weekend!” help make the conversation feel warmer and more personal.

***

## Minutes Of The Meeting July 2, 2025

**Work Item for Fake YouTube Ads**

* Please use the newly created work item titled **"CS – Fake Advertisement Notification"** for all fake YouTube ad reports.
* Do not use advisor-related work items for these cases.

***

**Orders Canceled Due to Fraud**

* Information on removing **high/medium fraud risk tags** is now on the 411.
* As per Alla, if a customer reaches out about a canceled order, they are most likely the legitimate owner.
* Steps to remove the fraud tag were provided by Alla and are safe to follow in these cases.

***

**Refund & Reshipment Process Reminders**

* Always **process the refund in Shopify** after informing the customer.
* Failure to do this may result in **disputes or customer frustration**.
* For **reshipments**, confirm the order to ensure it goes through.
* Incomplete steps may result in reshipments not being processed.

***

**Canceling Subscriptions**

* When a customer requests to cancel a "subscription", verify if it's for a product or Kajabi membership.
* If unclear, call the customer for clarification.
* Double-check both Kajabi and Shopify.

***

**Merging Customer Emails**

* If you merge a new customer email into an existing work item, **tag the original agent** (e.g., “@Cindy”) to notify them.
* This prevents missed messages and ensures proper follow-up.

***

**Timecard Reminders**

* Check your hours in **Rippling** to ensure you’re not over 40 hours/week.
* Use the **KB article "conversion"** to convert decimal hours to minutes.
* If you’re over, notify Cathy via chat and log the extra time accordingly.
* If submitting a change request, Cathy processes them promptly.

***

***

**Shipping Issues & Documentation**

* Use the “**CS Product Refund and Shipping**” document under **CS Updates** to log:
  * Recycled tracking numbers
  * Unpaid postage
  * Delays or missing handoffs after ProPAC
* Canadian orders and refusal to pay fees should be logged in the Canada-specific tab.

***

**Recycled Tracking Policy**

* **Do not reship or refund** recycled tracking orders unless **8 full business days** have passed.
* **Exclude holidays and weekends** from the count.
* These tracking numbers are a **USPS-wide issue** and not company-specific.

***

**Knowledge Base & Articles**

* If you frequently perform a task and it’s not documented, **submit a request** to create a KB article.
* Always **check KB first** before asking questions in the chat.
* Commonly asked questions will be considered for documentation.

***

**Amazon Returns – Prenatal Product**

* Some prenatals are still being returned via Amazon; escalated by Rachel and Maria.
* Let customers know they may order from **DrBerg.com** instead.
* Encourage sign-up for **marketing emails** for discounts and first-time ordering benefits.

***

**QA Reminders & Coaching Tips**

* **Always ask the customer**: “Is there anything else I can help you with?” – This is a **QA metric**.
* Mention the **customer’s name at least twice** during the call – this is worth **5 points**.
* Examples:
  * Greeting: “Hi \[Name], how are you today?”
  * Wrap-up: “Anything else for you today, \[Name]?”
* Use **empathetic tone and ownership statements**:
  * “I’m sorry that happened. Let me assist you.”
  * Avoid “I don’t know why it happened” type of statements.

***

***

## Minutes Of The Meeting July 22, 2025

**Survey Trends and Escalation Protocol**

* **Invalid Surveys Removed:**
  * Examples included consultation requests or no customer response after multiple follow-ups.
  * These were removed from CRM and not counted against agent performance.
* **Negative Feedback Insight:**
  * A noticeable rise in shipping-related complaints—particularly from Australia due to the **removal of flat rate shipping**.
  * Team advised to escalate trends seen in surveys or chats to Cathy, Jane, or Ava for weekly reporting.

***

**Key Process Reminders & Clarifications**

* **Replacements (Domestic):**
  * If an order is **past 8 business days** and tracking still shows _label created_, proceed to **reship or refund**.
  * No need to request dock search from ProPack — we are charged for that.
  * Email ProPack afterward for reimbursement documentation only.
* **Subscription Refunds:**
  * If a refund is issued for a **subscription order**, go ahead and **cancel the subscription** unless otherwise stated by the customer.

* Kathy will open a ticket for those experiencing issues to escalate with IT.

## Responding to Customers Questions About the Safety of Taking Multiple Supplements

I can share some info about the Upper Limits (ULs) for certain nutrients, but I need to be super clear: I'm not a medical expert, and I don't know your health history. So, this isn't personal advice! Everyone's different, and things like medications and health conditions can really change what's safe. Always, always talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian before you start taking any new supplements. They're the ones who can give you the right advice for you

***

## Sending Invoice? Is it Safe?

Suggested spiel:

_The email invoice is safe. This is part of our new process to ensure you can securely complete your order. You'll be entering your card information directly, which is in line with compliance regulations and designed to protect your privacy. This method is also more convenient for you, giving you full control over your payment details._

## What do we tell customers that ask whether or not Dr. Berg's supplements will cure or heal a condition?

If a customer asks you about cures for diseases or illnesses, politely explain to them that by the government's own rules, we do not allowed to diagnose diseases or tell them anything about treatment for disease, but what we can say is that we do have x product that supports (read product benefits directly from the label or approved information source). You can tell them that they may introduce this if they consult with their primary doctor and see how it goes for them

## Where Dr. Berg’s products are manufactured?

Our manufacturing company is based in the United States, we source some of our ingredients from other countries. However, we ensure that all of our ingredients meet our high standards for quality and safety. We do not use any ingredients sourced from countries with lower regulatory standards.

## Why our Discount Coupon Codes are Not Working in the EU Website

Unfortunately, our Flash Sales and Discounts are only offered in our US store.

The items available for sale on the EU website are offered by Dutch Tiger Health, an authorized reseller of Dr. Berg products, not Dr. Berg itself.

Any questions, concerns, claims, or liabilities relating to any purchases on the EU website shall be directed solely to the reseller (Dutch Tiger Health) and not Dr. Berg. Any sales, discount codes, or promotions offered directly by Dr. Berg are not available for purchase on the EU website.
