[SHOP_MISC] # Dr. Berg’s Farm – About ## Our mission: Cultivating fertile soil for nutritious food Knowing the devastating impact of soil degradation on plant and livestock quality, Dr. Berg embarked on a mission to grow fertile soil and nutritious, flavorful foods on his farm in Western Virginia. Modern agriculture results in infertile soils that yield nutrient-poor crops containing up to 40 percent fewer essential vitamins and minerals than produce harvested only five decades ago. Poor soil quality diminishes the nutrient density of crops and the livestock that feed on them, perpetuating a cycle of declining nutritional value in the food supply and compromising health. ## Dr. Berg’s approach to living soil ![](https://43dd65-a1.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/files/dr-berg-farm-hands-in-fertile-soil.webp?v=1725493213&width=896) Soil is more than the dirt under your feet; it’s a living ecosystem with water, minerals, gasses, microorganisms, and insects that work synergistically. ## Nurturing nutrient rich soil Dr. Berg conducts soil research to optimize the growth of nutrient-rich produce and the well-being of his animals, underscoring his commitment to foundational health principles. * ![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0559/4418/3880/files/greenhouse.jpg?v=1725993032&width=700) ### Greenhouse innovations for exceptional nutrition Dr Berg’s farm thrives on cutting-edge greenhouse techniques for nutrient-rich crops. Crop cultivation begins in a specialized greenhouse, where groundbreaking lighting techniques manage plant growth and nutrition. Intense red-spectrum grow lights mimic the sun's light spectrum, encouraging photosynthesis, boosting seedling development, and enhancing budding and flowering. The addition of blue light exposure increases the plants' phytonutrient content, supercharging their antioxidant capacity and nutritional value. * ![](https://43dd65-a1.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/files/Compost-soil-farm.jpg?v=1746202905&width=700) ### Turning waste into health Composting recycles decomposing organic matter, such as plant scraps and livestock manure, into a nutrient-rich amendment to increase soil fertility. The soil on Dr. Berg’s farm is carefully composted to ensure soil recovery and nutrient regeneration, providing maximum benefits for plant growth. Biochar, made from wood scraps heated to create charcoal, is also added to the soil as an eco-friendly alternative to perlite, which is energy-intensive to produce. Biochar stores carbon, increases soil porosity, improves water retention, and provides a habitat for beneficial microbes to flourish. It also enhances composting efficiency, shortening the timespan needed to create compost by 30 percent so nutrients can be added back into the soil more quickly. * ![](https://43dd65-a1.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/files/dr-berg-farm-greenhouse-watering.webp?v=1725456216&width=700) ### Every drop counts Water efficiency is foundational at Dr. Berg’s farm, where continuous developments are made to preserve and harvest mineral-rich water to drive plant growth and nutrient density. Biochar in the soil increases water retention by up to ten percent, requiring less frequent watering and moderate plant stress. This adaptive response produces crops richer in health-supporting phytonutrients. Rainwater is also harvested from the greenhouse and is funneled into an irrigation pond populated with bluegill fish, which fortify the water with nutrient-rich waste, reducing the need for soil amendments and fertilizer. * ![](https://43dd65-a1.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/files/dr-berg-farm-panoramic..webp?v=1725464385&width=700) ### Inspiring the future and educating tomorrow’s farmers Dr. Berg plans to open his farm to local students, helping to shape the minds of the next generation of farmers, homesteaders, and suburban gardeners. Students will discover where their food comes from by engaging in greenhouse activities, exploring the microscopic world of plant fertility, and learning about the intricacies of sustainable practices to enhance the health, nutritional value, and flavor of food. ## Meet Dr. Berg’s farm manager Dr. Berg is passionate about knowing where food comes from and talking to the people at the heart of the process—the farmers. That’s how Dr. Berg met Taco. Dr. Berg first came to him for fresh produce at the local Farmer’s Market where Taco shared a passion for nutrition and healthy growing practices that couldn’t be ignored. Now, he plays a vital role in making the Berg farm thrive. Taco has a deeply personal connection to the power of plants. When his wife was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer in 2018, Taco delved into the world of holistic healing. He discovered the incredible benefits of sulforaphane from broccoli sprouts and the therapeutic properties of Turkey tail mushrooms. His wife’s tumor shrank dramatically, and today she is cancer-free. Taco's journey with his wife fuels his dedication to cultivating life-enhancing crops on the farm.
