These locations were selected to give our customers the quickest transit time within the United States. We take pride in our efficient processing system. Orders that are received are swiftly prepared for shipment, as we are committed to dispatching them within 24 hours or less. Our warehouses do not ship out on weekends. Orders received on Friday after 1 pm EST will be shipped out Monday morning. Our warehouses are closed on federal holidays, which may cause delays in processing time. Please be aware that shipping delays may occur during peak seasons due to high demand faced by freight carriers. We are committed to processing your orders promptly, but delays with carriers may impact delivery times. Thank you for your understanding. ### Address accuracy Smooth shipping starts with an accurate address. We understand the importance of receiving your supplements promptly, which is why we emphasize the importance of providing precise and complete shipping information. Your shipping address acts as the roadmap for your package's journey from our warehouse to your hands. Even the smallest error or omission could lead to delays or even misdelivery. ## International shipments We’ve partnered with Global-E to offer a seamless shopping experience for our international customers. Global-E helps make your shopping easy by allowing you to: 1. **Shop in your local currency** – No need for conversion calculations. Prices are displayed in your preferred currency. Please note that the shipping address determines which currency you will be charged. 2. **Pay taxes and duties at checkout** – Say goodbye to surprise fees upon delivery. All taxes and import duties are calculated and paid during checkout, so no extra charges show up later. 3. **Multiple payment options** – You can use your preferred payment methods, from credit cards to local options, for a smoother transaction. Duties and taxes are calculated based on the items ordered, shipment destination, and the value of the purchase. If duties and taxes are charged at checkout, they will appear as a separate line item. If they are already included in the product price, there will be a note at checkout clarifying. Some countries require duties and taxes to be paid upon delivery and they will be the customer's responsibility. It will be noted at checkout for full transparency before you order. Please select the country switcher dropdown to see which countries we ship to and select accordingly. ### International shipping method DHL Express will be our preferred shipping method for all international orders, ensuring fast and dependable delivery for our customers.
