[SHOP_MISC] # Returns & Satisfaction Guarantee – Dr. Berg ## Purchasing multiple units Customers are encouraged to try our products and ensure they meet their expectations before making a large purchase of 3 or more units. Please be aware that purchasing multiple units of a product may disqualify you from being eligible for a refund. Additionally, we may require any unopened products to be returned at your expense. Our refund policy is designed to allow customers to try our products and make an informed decision about their suitability. When you purchase multiple units, it signifies a higher level of commitment, and it is assumed that you have already tested and approved the product. ## Non-refundable shipping costs Please note that while we offer a 30-day refund policy, shipping costs are non-refundable. This means that we will refund the purchase price of the product(s) but not the shipping charges associated with the original purchase. We believe in transparency, and we want to ensure that you are fully informed of our refund policy. If you have any questions regarding this policy or need assistance with a refund request, please do not hesitate to reach out to our customer support team. ## Undeliverable shipments policy: At Dr. Berg Nutritionals, we strive to ensure that your orders reach you in a timely and secure manner. In some cases, shipments may become undeliverable due to various reasons such as incorrect address information, failed delivery attempts, or other unforeseen circumstances. This policy outlines the steps we take to address undeliverable shipments within the United States: * **Reshipment option:** If a shipment is deemed undeliverable by our shipping carrier, we offer the option to reship the package to an alternative address provided by the customer. You may choose to have the package delivered to a different location, such as your workplace or the address of a trusted friend or family member. To request a reshipment, please contact our customer support team at [orders@drberg.com](mailto: orders@drberg.com). * **Refund option:** Alternatively, if you prefer not to have the undeliverable shipment reshipped, we can issue a refund for the product's cost minus the initial shipping charges. If you choose the refund option, the following conditions will apply: * The refund will be processed to the original payment method used for the order * Shipping charges are non-refundable, and they will be deducted from the refund amount * Please allow a minimum of 3 business days for the refund to be processed, as it may vary depending on your payment provider. To request a refund for an undeliverable shipment, please contact our customer support team at [703-354-7336](tel: 703-354-7336). We will guide you through the refund process and provide any necessary information. ## Refused shipments policy: Please be aware that when a shipment is refused by a customer, we do not refund the shipping charges associated with the order. The shipping charges are non-refundable, and they will be excluded from any refund issued for the refused shipment. ## International undeliverable shipment and refusal policy: At Dr. Berg Nutritionals, we understand that international shipping can come with unique challenges. In the event of an undeliverable shipment or refusal by an international customer, we have established a policy to ensure transparency and clarity regarding refunds and potential fees. * **Refund of product costs:** When an international shipment is undeliverable or refused by a customer, we will process a refund for the cost of the product(s) in the order. This refund will be issued to the original payment method used for the purchase. * **Additional fees may apply:** Please be aware that additional fees may apply in the case of an undeliverable shipment or a customer refusal. These fees are typically associated with the cost of returning the package to our facilities, as well as any customs-related charges incurred during the return process. These fees will be deducted from any potential refund issued for the product costs. The same rules apply if a shipment is destroyed by the carrier. To minimize the occurrences of undeliverable shipments and potential fees, please ensure that the shipping information provided during checkout is accurate and complete. Verify that the recipient's address is correct and that it is the intended delivery location. Make note of any customs or import fees that may apply during delivery. We value our international customers and are committed to ensuring your satisfaction with our products. ## Cancellation policy We understand that sometimes you may need to cancel an order, and we aim to provide flexibility while ensuring efficient order processing. Please take note of the following cancellation policy. Once an order has entered our warehouse and the processing has begun, it cannot be canceled. Our team works diligently to prepare and ship our order promptly, and at this stage, we are unable to stop the process. We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause. Please contact our customer support team with your order details, and they will assist you with the status of your order. If the order has not reached our warehouse, we will issue a full refund, including any shipping charges. We are dedicated to providing a seamless shopping experience and are committed to assisting you with any inquiries or concerns you may have.
