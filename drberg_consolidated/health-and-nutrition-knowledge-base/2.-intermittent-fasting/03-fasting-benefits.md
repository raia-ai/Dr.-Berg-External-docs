## What To Do For Alzheimers Disease If Nothing Is Working

# What to do for Alzheimer's Disease if nothing is working?

Interestingly, smoking cigarettes and ibuprofen reduce LH and Alzheimer's risk. Now, I'm definitely not saying you should start taking ibuprofen and smoking cigarettes to prevent AD.

The drug Lupron—which is used for endometriosis, fibroids, prostate cancer, and breast cancer—also decreases the risk of Alzheimer's. Lupron also happens to lower LH. However, Lupron has numerous adverse side effects.

There is one drug without side effects that can also decrease LH: melatonin. Melatonin is stimulated by darkness, and it helps you get into a deep sleep. It also helps stimulate your immune system and offers powerful antioxidant properties.

Melatonin has significant effects when it comes to reducing Alzheimer's risk in women. Men can also see some benefits when taking much larger amounts of melatonin.

Here is what the book recommends for reducing Alzheimer's risk.

- Females: 75mg of melatonin per day

- Males: 120 mg of melatonin per day

- 300mg pregnenolone

- 3tsp MCT oil

- Regular exercise

- Fasting

Always check with your doctor before applying any of this information. This is just to educate you on these interesting links between hormones and Alzheimer's disease.

## How Can I Eat What I Want And Still Lose Belly Fat

# How can I eat what I want and still lose belly fat?

It's more effective to change when you eat than what you eat to lose weight. Follow this guideline: have your first meal at 1:00 PM and your last meal at 5:00 PM, creating a 4-hour eating window. If this is too challenging, you can start with a 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM window instead. If needed, you can also include bulletproof coffee in the morning to help manage your eating window.

Benefits of This Eating Pattern:

• Significantly reduces insulin levels

• Promotes fat release through decreased insulin

• Reduces hunger and cravings

## Is Menopause Making Me Look Masculine

# Is menopause making me look masculine?

Insulin levels go up and that is what causes polycystic ovarian syndrome – by starting to convert this male hormone, androgen. During menopause, the ovaries work differently. The adrenal glands back up the ovaries and then when you get a sudden spike in cortisol (stress hormone), it can then convert into insulin. High androgen can also be a problem.

Symptoms of High Androgen Levels

• Male Pattern Baldness

• Alopecia – Patches of hair that come out in different places.

• PCOS – Acne, facial hair, hair loss, deep voice

• Infertility

• Deep Voice

• Oily Skin

• Skin Inflammation

• Increased Sex Drive

Cause of High Androgen

• Insulin Levels go up causing PCOS Reasons:

Eating a lot of sugar

The adrenal gland is backing up the ovaries.

• High Cortisol – Sudden spike in cortisol at menopause, which can then convert into insulin.

• Decreased Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) – It is the protein in the liver that helps regulate androgens, keeping them in check.

• During Menopause, the body stops releasing estrogen faster than it stops releasing androgens.

## What Are The Most Effective And Rapid Strategies For Detoxifying The L F3Bf1C

# What are the most effective and rapid strategies for detoxifying the liver, and how do various dietary, lifestyle, and supplementation approaches contribute to this process?

**Here are some tips for supporting your liver health:**

To support and speed up liver detoxification, we need to trigger autophagy.

The best ways to trigger autophagy:

1\. Dry fasting (Recommend doing it under medical supervision)

2\. Water fasting

3\. Calorie restriction

4\. Sleep

5\. Exercise

6\. Keto diet

7\. Phytonutrients

Dry fasting (recommended under medical supervision) is one of the most powerful ways to trigger autophagy and truly cleanse the liver cells.

With dry fasting, you don’t consume any food or water. To cleanse the liver, you may want to consider dry fasting for a full day—starting at sunrise and ending at sunset.

The effects of just one day of dry fasting are equivalent to three days of water fasting.

Additional benefits of dry fasting:

• Enhanced immunity

• Liver and kidney support

• Mental clarity

• Decreased inflammation

When the sun sets, you’ll eat your one meal for the day, which should consist of meat and cruciferous vegetables. These foods are also great for cleaning the liver.

Try dry fasting for three days of the month (they don't need to be consecutive) and see how you feel. (recommended that it is done under medical supervision)

Before you start dry fasting, take bile salts or TUDCA, consume beets, or drink apple cider vinegar with water to help thin your bile.

This can help prevent any negative liver detox side effects.

## The Role Of Cortisol In Morning Hunger

# The Role of Cortisol in Morning Hunger

## **The Role of Cortisol in Morning Hunger**

[Cortisol, often called the "stress hormone,"](https://www.drberg.com/blog/cortisol-extremely-simplified-by-dr-berg) plays a significant role in morning hunger while fasting and doing keto. When you wake up, cortisol levels experience a significant spike.

This spike is not just a tiny increase; it's more like a high jump athlete clearing the bar. The reason this matters is that when cortisol levels rise, it also leads to an increase in glucose (sugar) levels in the body.

This rise in blood sugar is the body's way of ensuring that you have enough energy to start your day.

However, for individuals [following a ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-start-keto-correctly) or [practicing intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/my-1-best-intermittent-fasting-tips-for-faster-weight-loss-dr-berg), this increase in blood sugar can also trigger the brain to signal hunger, even if you're not hungry.

Grasping the intricate interplay of hormones is vital for those tackling unwelcome morning cravings as they commit to their nutritional objectives.

So, the next time you feel your stomach growling before breakfast while on keto or during a fasting period, remember that cortisol may be playing a role in your morning routine.

## Epigenetic Effects And Potential Risks Of Dry Fasting

# Epigenetic Effects and Potential Risks of Dry Fasting

Dry fasting induces epigenetic changes that influence gene expression and stimulate autophagy, the body's process for recycling damaged cells. However, it is crucial to be aware of potential risks, such as dehydration and kidney strain. Prolonged dry fasting can lead to complications like kidney stones if not monitored carefully.

Consult a healthcare professional before beginning dry fasting to balance its potential benefits and risks.

In nature, plants undergo a similar process during droughts, conserving resources and enhancing resilience. For example, grapevines in arid conditions produce high-quality grapes as they prioritize fruit quality over quantity.

These natural phenomena illustrate how dry fasting can optimize resource use and promote healthier biochemical responses, reflecting the adaptive strategies seen in both human and plant physiology.

## What Are The Detoxification Benefits Of Dry Fasting

# What are the detoxification benefits of dry fasting?

Dry fasting offers significant detoxification benefits compared to water fasting. By initiating a process called autophagy, dry fasting facilitates the breakdown and recycling of damaged cellular components, thereby reducing inflammation and enhancing overall health.

**Enhancing Detoxification**

Dry fasting enhances detoxification by kick-starting autophagy, akin to a cellular "spring cleaning." This process helps remove metabolic waste and can improve health by reducing inflammation.

**The Sleep-Dry Fasting Connection**

Dry fasting can mimic some of the reparative effects of sleep. Just as rest promotes cellular repair, dry fasting supports cellular rejuvenation, making it a potent cleansing method with additional benefits.

**Endogenous Water Production**

During dry fasting, the body produces endogenous water through the metabolism of fat reserves. This internal hydration aids in detoxification, as it helps flush out toxins and supports cellular function.

**Caution and Preparation**

While dry fasting showcases remarkable adaptability and detoxification, it requires careful management to avoid dehydration and other health issues. Proper preparation and guidance are essential to safely harness its benefits.

## What Steps Can I Take To Address Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase Levels

# What steps can I take to address elevated alkaline phosphatase levels?

So one thing about the liver is it really doesn't give you any symptoms until later. It's kind of good that this showed up just so you can start working on your liver. The liver is the only organ that can completely 100% rejuvenate. It's rough, it's rugged. **So I would start taking milk thistle right away. That's one thing. And TUDCA, which will help to thin the bile because that liver enzyme is usually involved with a backup of more of the bile ducts and that which the Tudka is a natural way of thinning the bile, but then the milk thistle will actually protect the liver and bring down those enzymes.** And then of course, I'm assuming you're doing the healthy version of ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting. Hopefully you are and you can.

If you get on a ketogenic diet, you're going to find your liver enzymes probably will be much, much better in a couple of months because reducing the carbs is going to take a big stress off the inflammation in the liver. And one thing that's cool, if you do have any fat in the liver, which I don't know if you do, you have to do an ultrasound for that. You'll find that within even two weeks, you can reduce like 50% of the fat off the liver if you do the ketogenic diet correctly.

**There's a lot of things you can do for the liver, but I would stick with the TUDCA, the milk thistle, and I would do low carb and then get it retested. I think that enzyme will come down, but there's not a lot of things you can do medically to reverse liver disease because everything is involving toxicity. So really the natural way is the best way to approach this. And a lot of the foods that are good for the liver are like the persimmons, vegetables, microgreens, sprouts, and healthy proteins like eggs and things like that too. Eggs are really good for the liver. And so is grass-fed beef. That's really good for the liver too because it has the choline, which will protect the liver. Those are the things that I would suggest. And I think that can turn things around for you.**

Now, because the uricidal does water down the bile, should I stop that and just take the TUDCA? That's a really good question that I can't tell you not to take it, but I would just research the side effects from that and then research TUDCA. And then you make up your own mind based on the data because I think you'll be pleasantly surprised if you look at the wider viewpoint on this and side effects and benefits.

## Im Experiencing A Hair Loss On Frequent Fasting What Can I Do

# I'm experiencing a hair loss on frequent fasting, what can I do?

Hair loss during frequent or prolonged fasting can sometimes be caused by a lack of essential nutrients. Before starting a fast, it's important to build strong nutritional reserves, just like building muscle for exercise. To ease into fasting, start with a healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting with three meals a day. As your body adjusts, gradually skip meals until you reach one meal a day. Extend fasts slowly and carefully. The key is to listen to your body and progress at a comfortable pace.

**Supplement:**

- **Amino Acids (Dr. Minkoff Brand)**\-For healthy hair growth, your body relies on a steady supply of protein's building blocks, called amino acids. Diets lacking sufficient protein can disrupt this process and lead to hair growth problems.

- **Trace Minerals** -While a wide range of trace minerals impact hair health, iron, zinc, copper, silicon, and selenium play particularly vital roles in supporting hair follicle function and hair growth.

- **B-Vitamins** - are essential for hair growth because they support two key factors: healthy cell replication (which hair follicles rely on for rapid growth) and strong blood circulation to the scalp (which delivers vital nutrients to the hair follicles).

- **Whole Food Multivitamin** -Gives your body the nutrient reserves it needs to help prevent hair loss during periodic and prolonged fasting.

## How To Grow Your Muscles

# How to grow your muscles?

**Building Muscle on Keto with Intermittent Fasting**

Keto and intermittent fasting can support muscle growth, but exercise is essential. Here's what you need to know:

- **Intensity Matters:** Muscle growth depends on challenging workouts. Focus on pushing yourself to your limits.

- **Benefits of Fasting:** Fasting boosts human growth hormone (HGH), aiding muscle growth and preservation. Minimize snacking to maximize HGH benefits.

- **The Keto Advantage:** A well-formulated keto plan with intermittent fasting sets the stage for muscle building:

    - 2 meals a day

    - 50g carbs per day

    - 7-8 oz. protein per meal

    - Prioritize sleep

**The Dorian Yates Approach (Advanced)**

Inspired by 6-time Mr. Olympia Dorian Yates, this intense strategy can accelerate results:

1. **Warm-Up:** Light sets prepare your muscles.

2. **Go All Out:** One extremely hard set of 6-8 reps, then assisted reps to push beyond failure.

3. **Controlled Negatives:** Focus on the eccentric (lengthening) phase of each exercise.

4. **Full Recovery:** Work each muscle group once a week for optimal repair.

**Important Notes:**

- **Start Gradually:** If you're new to this intensity, ease in and consider a trainer's guidance.

- **Recovery is Key:** Intense workouts require ample rest for maximum muscle growth.

## How Can I Prevent Cramping And Nail Splitting During Prolonged Fasts

# How can I prevent cramping and nail splitting during prolonged fasts?

Biotin would help. That usually comes from the gut. It's in the category of B vitamins, but also silicon also is good for nail cracking. But I would look at both of those being a problem, especially if you're doing fasting, you're probably going to add some supplement to that.

## How Can I Maintain Weight Loss After Ozempic

# How can I maintain weight loss after Ozempic?

Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of Ozempic is crucial when considering how to manage your weight after stopping this medication.

As a GLP-1 Agonist, Ozempic mimics a hormone in your small intestine that helps regulate insulin levels, control appetite, and slow down gastric emptying. While this can aid in weight loss, it can also lead to adverse side effects.

**These side effects may include:**

• Nutrient deficiency

• Gastroparesis

• Constipation

• Gallbladder problems

• Thyroid tumors and cancer

**To help maintain your weight after Ozempic, it’s crucial to make certain lifestyle changes, such as:**

1\. Follow a ketogenic diet to keep insulin levels low and promote fat-burning.

2\. Do intermittent fasting to control appetite and improve hormone balance.

3\. Incorporate weight training to build and preserve muscle mass.

Additionally, ensuring adequate protein intake is crucial for maintaining muscle mass, especially for those who have already lost a significant amount of muscle while on Ozempic. This can be achieved through consuming bioavailable proteins such as red meat, eggs, and fish. Monitoring your hormone levels and ensuring proper cholesterol intake is also important, as cholesterol is a building block for many hormones, including testosterone and estrogen.

## What Are Some Effective Natural Alternatives To Adderall For Enhancing 01Cb06

# What are some effective natural alternatives to Adderall for enhancing focus and cognitive function without the use of pharmaceuticals?

There is an interesting natural adderall alternative that has virtually no side effects. It’s called Mucuna Pruriens or velvet bean. Mucuna Pruriens increases L-dopa, which turns into dopamine (a body chemical that triggers feelings of pleasure).

**Benefits**

- Increases focus and concentration

- Decreases brain fog

- Increases ability to learn

- Increases memory

- Increases mood

- Decreases stress

- Neuroprotective

**How to consume it**

You may want to cycle consumption of this substance by taking it for four days in a row and then not taking it for three days in a row or so forth. Follow the directions on the label for the proper dosage.

If you are trying to substitute velvet bean for adderall, consult with your medical doctor prior to undertaking it.

It will work a lot better if you also correct your diet by doing Healthy Keto® and intermittent fasting. Mucuna pruriens may help with symptoms, but you really want to correct the root cause of brain fog and lack of focus by fixing your diet.

**Where to get it**

You can get it at a health food store or order it online.

## What Approaches Can Be Considered For Managing Alzheimers Disease When A3D2B5

# What approaches can be considered for managing Alzheimer's disease when conventional treatments have proven ineffective?

Interestingly, smoking cigarettes and ibuprofen reduce LH and Alzheimer's risk. Now, I'm definitely not saying you should start taking ibuprofen and smoking cigarettes to prevent AD.

The drug Lupron—which is used for endometriosis, fibroids, prostate cancer, and breast cancer—also decreases the risk of Alzheimer's. Lupron also happens to lower LH. However, Lupron has numerous adverse side effects.

There is one drug without side effects that can also decrease LH: melatonin. Melatonin is stimulated by darkness, and it helps you get into a deep sleep. It also helps stimulate your immune system and offers powerful antioxidant properties.

Melatonin has significant effects when it comes to reducing Alzheimer's risk in women. Men can also see some benefits when taking much larger amounts of melatonin.

**Here is what the book recommends for reducing Alzheimer's risk.**

\- Females: 75mg of melatonin per day

\- Males: 120 mg of melatonin per day

\- 300mg pregnenolone

\- 3tsp MCT oil

\- Regular exercise

\- Fasting

Always check with your doctor before applying any of this information. This is just to educate you on these interesting links between hormones and Alzheimer's disease.

***We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.***

## What Can Help Me To Stop Snacking Or Grazing

# What can help me to stop snacking or grazing?

With snacking, you may have a certain time that you have a snack. With grazing, there’s no limit on how much you eat, what you eat, or when you eat. You eat constantly. I believe some of the worst advice a person can give is to snack to prevent overeating.

When people start snacking and grazing, they can get into a cycle of raising their blood sugar and insulin, then dropping their blood sugar. Eating causes hunger about one and a half hours later, especially when consuming carbohydrates. Then, the process repeats. If someone is stuck in this snacking cycle, eventually, they could develop high insulin, which could then lead to insulin resistance.

**Eating and depression:** You might feel better temporarily, but then the high insulin could cause depression to worsen.

**Eating when tired:** The more you eat to try to get more energy, the more tired you’ll be.

**Eating when bored or stressed:** The more you eat when bored or stressed, the more you release cortisol, which could cause you to be more stressed.

**Eating carbs for pleasure:** You could spike dopamine, putting yourself at risk for developing dopamine resistance.

**Eating for no reason:** Some people eat because the food is there, and then they get stuck in the snacking trap.

Many people don’t realize that when they do fasting correctly, they can put the body in a condition where there is no hunger or cravings. This is because your body is essentially eating your own fat all day long. Fat generates ketones, which is a clean fuel. You’ll feel good, you could have improved cognitive function, and you could have an enhanced mood.

**What to do:**

1\. Do not eat breakfast (most important)

2\. Understand that eating causes hunger

3\. Do not make junk foods available

4\. Stay very active

5\. Avoid carbs when you eat

## Why Cant I Lose Belly Fat After Menopause

# Why can't I lose belly fat after menopause?

When a woman goes through menopause, their ovaries no longer produce or release eggs. This big change leads to a cascade of other changes. The ovaries also make hormones, which means a woman in menopause will have lower hormone levels. However, when this happens, the adrenal glands are supposed to act as the backup system for the ovaries. The adrenal glands make all of the hormones that the ovaries make.

If the adrenal glands are strong and stable when a woman is going into menopause, they may experience fewer symptoms. It’s not normal to experience symptoms of menopause unless there’s a problem with the adrenal glands. Another part of the body we need to focus on is the parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system is the recovery system of the body. It influences your sleep and ability to recover. Fat burning occurs in the recovery phase.

Exercising your parasympathetic nervous system will help reduce cortisol, support sleep, and get rid of belly fat. In order to strengthen your parasympathetic nervous system, it’s crucial to increase the time you rest in between your reps and sets of exercise, as well as the days of exercise. You have to make sure you don’t overtrain and give your body a chance to completely recover and reset.

**How to lose belly fat after menopause:**

1\. Do high-intensity exercises with longer rest periods

2\. Don’t overtrain

3\. Don’t train over soreness

4\. Focus on getting more sleep

5\. Take advantage of chiropractic care, massage therapy, or physical therapy

6\. Consume omega-3 fatty acids

7\. Take DHEA

8\. Go on a low-carb diet with intermittent fasting

9\. Get plenty of magnesium, choline, vitamin B1, and vitamin D

10\. Try lemon balm, passionflower, or ashwagandha

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do *not* encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provide this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast.  If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

Most of the dangers of fasting I’m going to cover aren’t related to a 16 to 18-hour fast. This applies more to prolonged fasting, which is when a person fasts for 48 to 72 hours—or even longer. The purpose of eating is not just to get fuel. It’s also to get nutrients. When you’re fasting, you’re restricting nutrients. If your diet isn’t providing you with the nutrients you need when you do eat, you could end up with deficiencies that lead to certain issues.
**It’s crucial to do a prolonged fast correctly and avoid common mistakes related to the dark side of fasting.**

**The dark side of prolonged fasting:**

1\. Refeeding syndrome When you come off of a fast, have a small amount of food, wait a couple of hours, and have a little bit more. Avoid overeating or eating carbs.

2\. Dirty keto Make sure you consume nutrient-dense, high-quality foods on the keto diet.

3\. Not taking nutrients while fasting At the bare minimum, you need to take electrolytes, sea salt, trace minerals, and B vitamins while fasting.

4\. Kidney stones Avoid high-oxalate foods if you’re prone to kidney stones. Also, consume at least two and a half liters of fluid a day, and add lemon juice to your water. When you’re back to having meals, consume large salads.

5\. Anorexia Anorexia will cause nutritional deficiencies. Instead of fasting, get on the keto diet.

6\. Athletes that have not adapted to fat yet Give your body enough time to become fully fat-adapted before attempting prolonged fasting.

7\. Fasting for children Fasting isn’t a good idea for children. Eating three meals a day and cutting out snacking may be beneficial for children. Teenagers who are overweight may consider two meals a day without snacking.

8\. Not getting enough nutrition while pregnant or lactating Not getting enough nutrients while pregnant or lactating can lead to issues for the mother and child. Choosing a whole-food, natural prenatal vitamin over a synthetic prenatal vitamin is also important.

9\. Muscle loss If you’re older and noticing muscle loss, try adding a blend of amino acids to your diet.

10\. Ketoacidosis This rare condition occurs in people under very specific circumstances and isn't something most people should be concerned about.

## What Are The Therapeutic Benefits Of Inositol In The Management Of Pol C29Db8

# What are the therapeutic benefits of inositol in the management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)?

PCOS occurs when the androgen male sex hormones are too high in a women’s body. Symptoms include growing facial hair, developing belly fat, and hair loss on your head. You might get a deeper voice.

High levels of androgen are caused by high levels of insulin. So of course you want to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to lower your insulin levels. But there’s a little more to it.

There’s a vitamin called inositol that’s part of the vitamin B family. Interestingly, if you suck on it, it tastes sweet. Inositol is involved in sugar metabolism. Inositol is actually nine different vitamin B compounds, Two of the nine versions are called MYO and D-chiro. I and others believe that in women with PCOS, the MYO doesn’t convert to the d-chiro. So on top of the high levels of insulin and androgens, this contributes to the problem.

When you give women with PCOS a 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, their symptoms improve, as does their fertility, weight loss, acne, and the quality of their eggs. Find an inositol supplement that has this 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, to further enhance the benefits of keto and intermittent fasting. Inositol alone won’t completely help. You’ve got to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to get your insulin levels low enough to stop driving up your androgen levels.

## What Are The Therapeutic Benefits Of Laxatives

# What are the therapeutic benefits of laxatives?

Laxatives are herbs and medicines that produce bowel movements and relieve constipation. People often say they don’t want to take a laxative because they may be addictive (after taking them regularly for some time, your colon muscles lose strength and can become dependent on them). But the toxic effect of having chronic constipation can be very dangerous to the body compared to the minor side effects of taking a laxative.

**Side effects**

In addition to the colon developing an addiction to laxatives, you might experience a small drop in potassium from taking a laxative, but you can easily take more potassium to replenish it. Ultimately, you want to correct what’s really causing the constipation, which usually is either the food you’re eating or a lack of friendly bacteria.

**Laxatives can have these side effects:**

- They can be addictive

They can deplete electrolytes, like potassium (in this case, you would want to add the electrolytes back)

**How to consume them**

If you have constipation, as a coping mechanism take a herbal natural laxative like cascara sagrada. This should give you constipation relief while you figure out what’s really causing the condition.

**Where to get them**

Here is a list of the best natural laxatives:

- Senna

- Cascara sagrada

- Black psyllium (swells with water)

- Castor oil

- Magnesium

- Fermented vegetables

- Probiotics

- MCT oil

- Bile salts

- Vitamin B1

- Probiotics

- Fasting

## What Are The Possible Reasons For Insufficient Muscle Growth

# What are the possible reasons for insufficient muscle growth?

Lack of muscle growth can have several underlying reasons; however it has simple and effective remedies.

**Cause #1: Lack of workout intensity**

To be able to have muscle growth you have to do higher weights and lower reps. This is because your muscle tissues need to be damaged from the exercise for your body to heal them and make them bigger. Make sure your technique is correct to avoid injuries and gradually increase the intensity.

**Remedies:**

- Hire a personal trainer to help you with the workouts and technique

- Put enough weights so you can barely do 5 to 7 reps (make sure you gradually increase the weights)

- Do more compound exercises that affect several muscles:

deadlifts

squats

overhead push

power clean

**Cause #2: Lack of recovery**

Your muscles grow when you sleep. This is because after the exercises your body has to heal the damaged muscle tissues and grow them. If you have high-intensity exercises and you eat correctly but don’t recover this can definitely cause inability to gain muscle mass. The best way is to improve your recovery.

Additionally, if you undergo high amounts of stress, this will cause your body to produce too much cortisol (stress-regulating hormone). Cortisol could break down your muscle tissues and turn them into blood sugar.

**Remedies:**

- Sleep 8 to 9 hrs per day (take naps if needed)

- Let your muscles recover fully before training the same muscles again

- Consume potassium (4,700 mg / day)

- Consume more vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast

• benfotiamine

- Avoid things and people that stress you out

- Take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes).

**Cause #3: Low amounts of human growth hormone and testosterone**

There are two main hormones that help us grow and retain muscles. These are testosterone and human growth hormone. If you lack these hormones it can result in muscle loss and inability to grow it.

Human growth hormone (HGH) is an anti-aging hormone. It burns fat as well as building muscles and regenerating the body. The best way to increase HGH is to do intermittent fasting and high-intensity full body training.

Testosterone is a male hormone that is also needed for women in smaller amounts. Having normal amounts of testosterone in addition to exercises can build your muscles. One way to improve testosterone is by avoiding things that cause it to go low.

**Remedies:**

- Increase human growth hormone by doing these things:

    - do intermittent fasting

    - consume 7 to 8 oz of protein per meal

    - improve sleep

- Increase testosterone by doing the following:

    - consume more cholesterol (helps to make testosterone)

    - consume moderate amounts of protein (6 to 8 oz in meal)

    - consume zinc (100 mg / day)

- consume korean red ginseng

- take L-arginine

- take D-aspartic acid

- consume cruciferous vegetables (natural estrogen blockers)

- consume DIM (concentrated cruciferous)

- consume white button mushrooms

- consume mushrooms in general

- consume celery

- consume parsley

- consume olive oil

**Cause #4: Insulin resistance**

Consuming a lot of refined carbs and sugars will spike your insulin high in order to lower the blood sugar level that results. Eventually your cells become resistant to insulin. The connection between insulin resistance and lack of muscle growth requires an understanding of insulin.

Insulin acts like a key to the cells, allowing them to absorb vital nutrients. If your cells are resistant to insulin they don’t absorb protein well, causing slow muscle growth or inability to grow muscle.

If you do the Healthy Keto® diet as well as an intermittent fasting plan your body cells will be less resistant to insulin--allowing them to absorb more protein and therefore grow more muscle mass.

**Other causes:**

- Avoid snacking (spikes insulin)

- Avoid refined carbs and sugar

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do intermittent fasting

- Keep your carbs under 50 g/day

- Consume moderate amounts of protein (6 to 8 oz per meal)

## What Are The Various Benefits Associated With The Supplementation Of C C5E64F

# What are the various benefits associated with the supplementation of creatine powder, particularly in relation to athletic performance and overall health?

The benefits of creatine powder, as highlighted in the provided context, span across various aspects of health and fitness. Here's a detailed look at the key benefits:

1. **Enhanced Muscle Strength and Power**: Creatine is renowned for its ability to increase the body's capacity to perform high-intensity activities. This is achieved through the recycling of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is crucial for muscle contractions. This process supports sustained energy production within muscle cells during short bursts of intense exercise, thereby enhancing overall strength and power.

2. **Promotes Muscle Gain**: Creatine powder draws water into muscle cells, contributing to muscle growth and improved muscle volume. This effect not only aids in achieving a more muscular appearance but also supports the muscle-building process by enhancing the synthesis of proteins that form new muscle fibers.

3. **Faster Exercise Recovery**: Supplementing with creatine has been found to reduce muscle damage and inflammation following intense workouts. By replenishing ATP in muscle cells post-exercise, creatine facilitates more efficient muscle repair and growth. This quicker recovery allows for more frequent and intense training sessions, contributing to better performance and muscle gains over time.

4. **Neuroprotective Effects**: Beyond its muscle-enhancing properties, creatine has shown potential benefits for brain health. It may play a role in the treatment of neurological disorders and support cognitive function due to its ability to increase ATP concentrations in brain tissue. This increase in energy supply can aid in maintaining neuronal health and balanced neurotransmitter levels, which are essential for effective communication between brain cells.

5. **Supports Brain Function**: Creatine's ability to boost ATP production extends to the brain, where it can enhance cognitive function, particularly under conditions of stress or sleep deprivation. This makes creatine beneficial not only for physical performance but also for tasks requiring mental sharpness.

In summary, creatine powder offers a versatile range of benefits, from improving muscle strength and accelerating recovery to potentially supporting brain health. Its role in increasing ATP production is central to its effectiveness in both physical and cognitive domains.

## Can Elevated Estrogen Levels Contribute To The Development Of Acne

# Can elevated estrogen levels contribute to the development of acne?

Estrogen is a vital hormone that has many different functions in the body. However, if your body has excess estrogen it can be the reason for acne, especially if intermittent fasting and the Healthy Keto® diet have not resolved your skin problems.

## Is It Possible To Alleviate Migraines By Following A Ketogenic Diet

# Is it possible to alleviate migraines by following a ketogenic diet?

There are many things that can cause a migraine headache. But ketones can potentially help your brain in many ways.

A study in 1930 demonstrated that 28% of migraine sufferers reported having no migraines after being on keto. 25% of migraine sufferers reported less frequent migraines after being on keto.

Recent evidence suggests that migraines may stem from a cerebral energy deficiency. Part of the brain may not be getting energy. This could also relate to insulin resistance, which could be one reason why ketones may be effective. Ketones actually provide an alternative fuel to the brain.

The other factor that may contribute to a migraine is too much oxidative stress compared to how much antioxidant capacity you have. Ketones can act as an antioxidant.

Ketones may not only protect you from free-radical damage, but also they may act as an anti- inflammatory. Your brain loves ketones and actually prefers ketones over glucose.

**Potential benefits of ketones for the brain:**

- Can help improve your mood

- Can help improve your cognitive function (memory, focus and concentration)

- May help improve epilepsy

- Could help increase mitochondria function

- Can help reduce oxidative stress

If you have migraines, you may want to get on the ketogenic diet. It may also be beneficial to consume MCT oil and even exogenous ketones to help boost your ketones further.

**How to help supply the brain with ketones:**

- Do Healthy Keto®

- Eliminate snacks (do intermittent fasting)

## Which One Is Better Fasting Or Keto

# Which one is better: fasting or keto?

Initially, when you compare fasting and keto, you can see that fasting has a more powerful impact on your health than just ketosis. However, it’s best to combine fasting and keto together to enhance the benefits of both. Doing one will actually help the other. Combining the two will make doing both keto and fasting easier. It will also help you reach your health and weight-loss goals much faster.

## What Are The Benefits Of Caffeine For Hair Loss

# What are the benefits of caffeine for hair loss?

**Interesting effects of caffeine:**

1\. Stimulating hair follicle growth 

2\. Counters the suppressive action of DHT (DHT blocks and suppresses hair growth)

3\. Stimulates faster hair growth 

**\*There are caffeinated shampoos that may work as a hair loss shampoo.**

One reason some older men and women experience hair loss is because of their free testosterone going down. A lot of other problems can accompany a low testosterone issue. But, in this situation, zinc can also be very beneficial. Zinc is important in helping to regulate testosterone.

## How Can I Improve My Sleep When On Intermittent Fasting Plan

# How can I improve my sleep when on Intermittent fasting plan?

**Sleep is vitally important when you’re on keto and intermittent fasting. Let’s find out how to improve sleep if you’re having challenges.**

A lack of high-quality sleep could be the reason you’re not losing weight. Most of the hard-core fat-burning through the stimulation of growth hormone happens when you’re asleep. Also, fixing insulin resistance and blood sugar problems requires sleep. If you have diabetes, you probably notice that your blood sugars are way off on the days when you didn’t get a good night’s sleep.

Insomnia is a symptom of another problem; insomnia isn’t a disease. Let’s go through some reasons why you may not be getting high-quality sleep.

**The first is frequent eating.** If you’re not doing intermittent fasting, and you eat snacks between meals, that will spike your insulin. You’ll be tired during the day but not be able to sleep at night. So, plus in intermittent fasting. Three meals per day, no snacks, then gradually move to two meals per day, no snacks.

**Second, you may be getting up frequently to urinate.** That’s a problem with insulin resistance. One of the symptoms of diabetes is frequent urination. Doing keto and intermittent fasting correctly will eventually correct the frequent urination. If you want to do a test to determine if you have a problem with insulin resistance, get a test called HOMA-IR.

Or you may have problems with your adrenals caused by accumulated stress in your body. Your body is in a constant state of flight or fight. I suggest a natural sleep aid and massage. If you’re consuming foods that cause you to bloat, such as cruciferous vegetables, that could disrupt your sleep. Start eating regular green lettuce instead, for example. Reduce the amount of cruciferous vegetables you consume, then gradually increase it.

**Lastly, sleep apnea could be the culprit.** It’s a problem of too much insulin. Keto and intermittent fasting will eventually correct it and help improve your sleep.

## Does Fasting Help With Fear Related Disorders

# Does fasting help with fear-related disorders?

**Fear is an emotion that helps us survive, but it’s not good when the body is in a chronic state of fear.** 

**I believe one of the most powerful things you can do is fasting. There are many different things fasting can do for the brain, immune system, and mood. It can potentially elevate your mood from a chronic state of anxiety or fear to a much higher state.** 

Fasting is a survival mechanism that helps you survive in times of danger and tends to counter the fear emotion. It supports the adrenal glands, a structure in the brain called the amygdala, and the sympathetic nervous system. 

The amygdala has a lot to do with fear. The sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) is located inside the adrenal glands and mid-back nerves. Some studies show that fasting may help the adrenal glands, amygdala, and sympathetic nervous system. 

**Potential benefits of fasting for fear-related disorders:**

• It may help improve a person’s mood 

• It increases GABA

• It increases dopamine 

• It reduces cortisol 

• It reduces the fight or flight mechanism by improving sympathetic nervous system dominance 

**How to do fasting for fear-related disorders:**

• Don’t eat if you’re not hungry, especially in the morning 

• Do two meals a day (lunch and dinner) with zero snacking 

Step 1. Do intermittent fasting without changing your diet 

Step 2. Do intermittent fasting with the healthy keto diet

## Do I Eat Less Or More Calories On Intermittent Fasting

# Do I eat less or more calories on intermittent fasting?

**If someone is struggling to lose weight, they typically reduce the calories and end up finding that it will not work.**

Lowering the calories does eventually lower your metabolism. Yet, if you compare spreading your calories out with three meals with two snacks on a 1500 calories per day diet with an increase in calories (2000) for a given day - but ONLY consume two meals per day, you will lose more weight.

**The reason for this is twofold:**

1\. Every time you eat, you stimulate insulin. And insulin is the hormone that blocks fat burning and weight loss.

2\. In the presence of only a tiny excess of insulin above normal will nullify and block fat burning.

## What Are Important Fasting Rules

# What are important fasting rules?

The 7 most important intermittent fasting rules are as follows:

**1\. Hydration is Key**: Drinking water, tea, and coffee while fasting is beneficial. Certain teas can help extend your fast and reduce hunger. Coffee is fine, but avoid excessive consumption.

**2\. Supplement Wisely:** Taking supplements like vitamins, electrolytes, trace minerals, nutritional yeast, and omega-3 fatty acids is important while fasting. A green drink without fiber, like wheatgrass juice powder, is acceptable. Avoid protein powders and branched-chain amino acids. Bone broth or MCT oil can be tried but may not suit everyone.

**3\. Listen to Your Hunger Cues**: Only eat when you're truly hungry. If you reach your fasting goal and feel like you can go longer, it's okay to extend your fast. However, don’t push yourself to the point of weakness, fatigue, irritability, or dizziness.

**4\. Refeed Gradually:** After fasting for 48 hours or more, reintroduce food slowly. Start with a small amount of food and wait before gradually increasing your intake.

**5\. Monitor Insulin Resistance:** Your ability to fast can indicate your insulin resistance level. If fasting is easy, your insulin resistance may be improving. Difficulty fasting may suggest you still have insulin resistance and need more time and effort.

**6\. Combine with Healthy Keto:** Pair intermittent fasting with a healthy keto diet. This combination helps keep insulin levels low and offers numerous health benefits. A high-carb diet could undermine the benefits of intermittent fasting.

## Im Scared To Do Intermittent Fasting Is There Anything To Worry About

# I'm scared to do intermittent fasting, is there anything to worry about?

Intermittent fasting offers numerous benefits, including improved cognitive function such as enhanced focus and memory, mood elevation, reduced inflammation, and the promotion of new cell growth in the brain. To begin fasting, start by consuming three meals a day without snacking. Incorporate more fat into your meals to help extend the time between eating. Initially, the primary goal should not be weight loss but rather reducing hunger and promoting your overall health.

## Does Fasting Affect Growth Hormone

# Does fasting affect growth hormone?

Growth hormone is naturally produced in the body and has many benefits, including boosting fat-burning, preserving and increasing muscle mass, boosting collagen (anti-aging), and increasing bone density. As you age, your body begins to produce less growth hormone.

Fasting can boost the production of growth hormone in your body, with a 2-day fast increasing levels by as much as 200% in the body. Adopting intermittent fasting will also boost growth hormone on a smaller scale, helping you preserve muscle mass better than a low-calorie diet can. The anti-aging effects of increasing growth hormone are a great reason to adopt intermittent fasting as an eating pattern.

## When Should I Exercise During Fasting

# When should I exercise during fasting?

Typically a big mistake people make is adding too many things like keto, intermittent fasting, and exercise too fast. Maybe they’re trying to go to two meals a day right away and are exercising on top of that. This could be too much too soon.

A good indicator to know if you’re ready for exercise is how you feel when you start to exercise.

You may not want to do things like cardio or interval training early in the morning if you’re fasting. You could deplete your glycogen reserve, and if you’re not adapted, you’re going to get really hungry. You may want to exercise just before your meal, in-between your first and second meal, or just after your last meal. Some people may benefit from adding more protein to their diet when they workout.

Some people may also need to add a meal when they work out if they are too hungry and haven’t fully adapted yet. Another thing that may help is creatine. Creatine could potentially help improve recovery and increase muscle mass. Creatine doesn’t have to be taken with a meal.

## Will Fasting Help With Chronic Inflammation

# Will fasting help with chronic inflammation?

Inflammation serves to repair injuries and fight infections, but chronic inflammation, unlike acute inflammation, provides no long-term benefits and can cause various health issues such as scar tissue formation and insulin resistance. Chronic inflammation, often associated with autoimmune conditions, can be mitigated through fasting, which turns off inflammation-related genes and supports adrenal health. Intermittent fasting and longer fasts are recommended to reduce or eliminate inflammation, as fasting enhances the body's antioxidant network and overall resilience.

\*Please keep in mind that the above is not a medical advice. You should see your doctor about any possible medical conditions.

## Whats The Difference Between Ketogenic Diet And Intermittent Fasting

# What's the difference between ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting?

The ketogenic diet (keto) and intermittent fasting are two different dietary approaches with different focuses. Keto is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that aims to induce ketosis, where the body burns fat for fuel, by strictly reducing sugar and carb intake. In contrast, intermittent fasting centers on the timing of meals, alternating between periods of eating and fasting, without specifying what foods to eat.

While keto requires significant changes to food choices to maintain specific macronutrient ratios, intermittent fasting offers flexibility and can be combined with various diets, including keto. Combining keto and intermittent fasting can have many health benefits, including weight loss and autophagy (cellular renewal).

## What Are The Potential Side Effects Of Fasting

# What are the potential side effects of fasting?

The side effects of fasting occur primarily during the transition phase from eating to consuming nothing. Potential side effects include a spike in uric acid, feeling cold, moodiness, headaches, increased stomach acid, nausea when eating, fainting (if prolonged fasting is done too quickly), and hair loss. However, if you push through the symptoms and start the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting correctly, they shouldn't be a significant problem.

## What Are The Key Nutrients And Herbs For Intermittent Fasting

# What are the key nutrients and herbs for intermittent fasting?

The longer the fast you undertake, the more important your nutrient intake is. If you already have a nutrient deficiency, a long fast can aggravate it, causing symptoms like dizziness, feeling faint or tired, rashes, muscle cramps, palpitations, or chills.

Taking nutrients or herbs goes against the true definition of fasting, which is drinking only water, eating nothing, and not taking any nutrients or herbs. But, there are not enough calories involved in taking nutrients or herbs to effect the benefits of fasting. Some key nutrients for fasting include B vitamins, trace minerals, vitamins D and C, and electrolytes. Green tea, garlic, wheatgrass juice powder , and turmeric are all good herbs to consume on a fast.

## What Are The Most Common Mistakes That People Make On Intermittent Fasts

# What are the most common mistakes that people make on intermittent fasts?

Intermittent fasting provides a ton of health benefits. But some common intermittent fasting mistakes could cause it to be more difficult than it should be. For example, starting to quick and fasting for too long instead of slowly adjusting your eating window will cause many people to quit. Intaking more potassium, B vitamins and trace minerals can help with this.

Overindulging in carbs during an eating window will also make fasting more difficult as it spikes your insulin levels. Not eating enough nutrients or consuming low-quality ingredients during your eating window will also ruin your fasting experience. Finally, not consuming enough fat during your meals causes you to feel much hungrier during your fast, and can make you want to quit.

## Why Do People Fail With Intermittent Fasting

# Why do people fail with intermittent fasting?

There are a few reasons someone might fail at intermittent fasting. The first is that they never even start, because they are afraid of starvation and extreme discomfort as they do not understand how well the body adapts to fasting. Some are too used to eating multiple times a day and cannot find the motivation to cut down their eating window.

Others start the intermittent fasting diet but quit after the first few days because they feel worse. This is because they do not understand it takes some time to adjust. These early transitional symptoms can be alleviated by taking potassium, sodium, and B1. The final reason people quit is because they are not losing weight. In this instance, it is important to focus on the many other positive benefits fasting has provided you, like improved energy, decreased cravings, less hunger, and increased mental clarity.

## What Are The Different Stages Of Fasting

# What are the different stages of fasting?

**Dr. Berg Nutritionals does not encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provides this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.**

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast. If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

The six stages of fasting:

Stage 1: 8-14 hours

• Stable blood sugar levels

• Using up stored sugar and sugar in the blood

• At 10 hours—the muscles use about 50% glucose and 50% fat (you’re starting to transition to fat-burning)

Stage 2: 14-24 hours

• Starting to get into ketosis

• Fewer cravings

• More energy

• Improved mood

• Improved cognitive function

Stage 3: 24-36 hours

• Full ketosis and fat burning

• The liver is making ketones

• Decreased appetite

• Decreased ghrelin

• Increased BDNF (new brain cells)

Stage 4: 36-48 hours

• Autophagy

• Kill cancer cells

• Decreased oxidative stress

• Decreased misfolded proteins

• Increased memory

Stage 5: 48-60 hours

• Insulin sensitivity super boost

• More autophagy

• Less inflammation

• Atrophy healing

• Protein sparing

Stage 6: 60-72 hours

• Immune system regeneration

• Spike in immune stem cells

• A 2014 study demonstrated that a 72 hour fast led to a complete rejuvenation of the immune system, and people on chemotherapy had less damage

## How Can I Avoid Getting Angry While I Do Intermittent Fasting

# How can I avoid getting angry while I do intermittent fasting?

When you start intermittent fasting, your body is initially running on sugar stores. After a long enough period, your body will have used up all the glycogen and will switch over to burning fat for energy. If you eat a meal high in sugars after a period of intermittent fasting, this will cause a drastic spike in insulin, leading to irritability. To avoid this, be sure that your meals are rich in nutrients and low in carbohydrates, so that your blood sugar remains in a healthy range and you do not experience mood swings.

## What Do I Do If I Dont Feel Satisfied After Eating On Keto

# What do I do if I don't feel satisfied after eating on Keto?

There are usually two reasons. Either you’re still having a problem with insulin resistance, or you have a gallbladder issue and aren’t releasing enough bile. If it’s low bile, my gallbladder formula may help.

Typically, though, people have a problem with insulin resistance. With insulin resistance, insulin isn’t connecting to the cell, and you’re unable to absorb nutrients, amino acids, and fuel. You might have to give it more time, but let’s make sure you’re doing keto correctly. You need a lot of vegetables. You don’t want to add carbs, or too much protein, because otherwise, you’ll prolong the insulin resistance.

But you can increase your fat intake. I love pecans; they’re the fattiest nut. Take a handful, and another if you need to until you feel satisfied. Nut butters are great with celery or maybe even carrots. The cheese is good too. Brie is a fatty cheese that will help satisfy you.

Apple cider vinegar is good to consume with a meal. It will help with insulin resistance. I like to consume salad or vegetables first, then protein, then fat. Mainly, give keto and intermittent fasting more time. If you have had a big problem with insulin resistance, it will take a while to heal it. As you do keto correctly, and give it more time, you’re going to start feeling more satisfied. I know keto and intermittent fasting will help you, which is why I urge you to be patient in order to get the outcome you want.

## What Potential Risks Or Adverse Effects Should Be Considered When Inco 2A7C1B

# What potential risks or adverse effects should be considered when incorporating ginger into the diet?

Despite ginger’s historical use and numerous advantages, it is essential to address the potential risks, especially when certain health conditions or medication interactions exist.

Being informed about these aspects enables you to use ginger safely and make choices that align with your well-being.

### **Blood Thinning Considerations: Avoiding Excessive Thinning**

Individuals already taking blood-thinning medications need to be mindful. Because ginger naturally thins the blood, combining it with certain medications, like warfarin or even aspirin, could amplify the effects, increasing the risk of bleeding.

Consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice.

### **Lowering Blood Pressure: Being Mindful with Medications**

Ginger can help regulate blood pressure. But if you’re taking blood pressure medications, it is important to know that ginger might enhance their effect.

If you combine ginger with blood pressure medication, you could experience a drop in blood pressure, which can lead to lightheadedness or dizziness.

**Gallbladder Stimulation: Careful Consideration for Existing Issues**

If you experience frequent gallstones or have a history of [gallbladder problems](https://www.drberg.com/blog/gallbladder-problems-and-prolonged-fasting), exercise caution. Ginger can stimulate the gallbladder, potentially leading to discomfort or exacerbating existing issues.

Pay close attention to how your body responds, and if necessary, consult with a medical professional before continuing use.

## What Are The Best Methods For Incorporating Vitamin B2 Into My Diet An 00Dd07

# What are the best methods for incorporating vitamin B2 into my diet, and which foods or strategies can help ensure adequate daily intake of this essential nutrient?

### **Incorporating Vitamin B2 Into Your Diet**

Here's how you can increase vitamin B2 intake:

1. Add mushrooms or spinach to your breakfast omelet or lunchtime salad.

2. Sprinkle nuts or seeds over full-fat yogurt or smoothies for added crunch and nutritional benefits.

3. If liver isn't typically part of your meals due to its strong flavor, try mixing small portions into dishes like stews, which blend seamlessly with other ingredients.

4. [Incorporate powerful herbs](https://www.drberg.com/blog/5-herbal-remedies-for-sciatica), like turmeric, ginger, and garlic, which help with inflammation and relieve sciatica pain.

If adding these ingredients to your diet does not raise your vitamin intake enough, consider taking a high-quality B2 supplement.

## What Are The Underlying Reasons For Stomach Growling

# What are the underlying reasons for stomach growling?

You may have stomach sounds or stomach growling when you’re hungry, but hunger is not what’s causing it. Something called the migrating motor complex is what causes stomach growling. This is a certain housekeeping condition in your body where it’s cleaning out debris (extra food particles).

One really important function of the migrating motor complex is that it can prevent SIBO. SIBO is a condition where you have too much bacteria in your small intestine. The majority of bacteria should be in the large intestine. When bacteria get into the small intestine, you’ll start to be robbed of nutrients. You could also start to experience a lot of bloating from fermentation going on in your small intestine.

**How to stop stomach growling:**

• Eating (but if you have SIBO eating could increase bloating)

• Increase bile salts

• Decrease stress

• Fix SIBO (increase bile and take betaine hydrochloride)

• Do intermittent fasting

## Why Does Dr. Berg Use Synthetic Ingredients   Benfotamine

# Why Does Dr. Berg Use Synthetic Ingredients - Benfotamine

**Why Are Synthetic Ingredients Used in Dr. Berg’s Products?**

In the world of supplements, natural isn’t always better, and synthetic doesn’t mean unsafe or inferior. Synthetic ingredients are often chosen because they’re the only way to deliver precise, powerful, and proven results. Here’s why certain synthetic ingredients are used in Dr. Berg’s formulas:

**Benfotiamine (Synthetic Vitamin B1)**

Superior Absorption: Benfotiamine is specifically designed for your body to utilize it, unlike standard thiamine, which passes through the body quickly. This synthetic form is fat-soluble, so it crosses cell membranes and reaches nerve tissues where it’s needed most.

Targeted Benefits: You’d have to take large doses of standard thiamine to match the effectiveness of benfotiamine. This form was created specifically to help support nerve health in a way that natural thiamine simply can’t.

 Exclusively Synthetic: Benfotiamine isn’t found in nature—it must be created in a lab. This synthetic form ensures a consistently pure, potent, and bioavailable dose that nature does not provide.

Bottom Line: Benfotiamine isn’t used to avoid natural ingredients—it’s used because it is not found in nature and works better, faster, and more reliably than standard natural thiamine.

## Why Is The Blood Glucose Level Higher During Fasting Than Feeding

# Why is the blood glucose level higher during fasting than feeding?

Blood glucose levels may be higher while fasting than when you are feeding. Below are some potential reasons why. Please consult with a medical professional to determine if an underlying medical condition may affect your individual health outcomes.
Dawn phenomenon: This is a natural rise in blood glucose levels in the early morning hours, a process regulated by the release of counter-regulatory hormones like cortisol, growth hormone, and glucagon. If the fast ends in the morning, this could contribute to higher glucose levels, but it's a normal part of your body's function.

Gluconeogenesis: The liver produces glucose through gluconeogenesis to maintain blood sugar levels. This process can happen while feeding but is most increased at the 12-24 hour point of a fast, sometimes leading to a temporary increase in blood glucose.

Insulin resistance: Fasting can temporarily increase insulin resistance, which may result in higher blood glucose levels when the fast ends.

Stress response: Fasting is a form of stress on the body, which can trigger the release of stress hormones like cortisol. It's important to acknowledge that this can raise blood sugar levels, but it's a normal part of fasting.

Diet: Many foods have a glucose-lowering effect that may reduce blood sugars during feeding.

Individual variation: Some people may experience a paradoxical increase in blood glucose during fasting due to their unique physiology or underlying health conditions.

## What Are The Heart Healthy Fats Found In Olives And How Do They Contri 762B87

# What are the heart-healthy fats found in olives, and how do they contribute to cardiovascular health?

Olives are rich in healthy monounsaturated fats (MUFAs), especially oleic acid, which provides numerous health benefits, particularly for the heart.

**Oleic Acid and Anti-Inflammatory Properties**

Oleic acid, an omega-9 fatty acid, has potent anti-inflammatory effects. It helps combat chronic inflammation, which is linked to diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Research shows oleic acid can suppress cancer-related genes and enhance the effectiveness of certain cancer treatments.

**Monounsaturated Fats for Heart Health**

MUFAs in olives help improve cholesterol levels by lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol and increasing HDL (good) cholesterol, reducing heart disease risk. A study in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a diet rich in MUFAs from olive oil significantly reduced heart disease risk.

**Low-Carb Benefits**

Olives are low in carbohydrates, making them an excellent snack for low-carb or ketogenic diets.

Incorporating olives into your diet supports heart health, reduces inflammation, and fits well with low-carb eating plans.

## What Are The Most Famous Myths About Healthy Weight Loss

# What are the most famous myths about "healthy" weight loss?

Here are 7 lessons I learned from weight loss failures from my practice of 25 years and working with 40,000 people.

1\. Fruit – Don’t use fruit if you are trying to lose weight and someone who has a slow metabolism. Even small amounts of fruit can block a lot of fat burning.

2\. Snacks – Snacking increases insulin because every time you eat, you trigger insulin. Cutting out snacks creates huge benefits.

3\. 2 weeks – low protein (Liver enhancement) or no protein – would cause a lot of blood sugar issues because our bodies need amino acids to rebuild and repair. Cutting it too low or not enough will cause problems like hair loss, loss of muscle, etc.

4\. “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day” – It screws up and breaks the all-night fasting. Push yourself to eat closer to lunch and not eat until you’re hungry and eventually skip breakfast.

5\. Low Fat (Lean Protein) – Fat is very important to satisfy the appetite to go from one meal to another. It is the only macronutrient that doesn’t trigger insulin – the more pure the fat is, the lower the influence it has on insulin.

6\. History – Clue (Ignoring – Focusing more on diving into the process directly and not ignoring the clues.

7\. Omitting Getting Healthy First – It is not losing weight to get healthy, it is getting healthy first and then losing the weight. Focus on the health indicators: energy level, cravings are gone, stress level better.

## Can Healthy Keto Help With Psoriasis

# Can Healthy Keto help with psoriasis?

Yes, the Healthy Keto® diet can help with psoriasis. Here are some key points from Dr. Berg's recommendations:

\- **Anti-Inflammatory Foods**: Incorporating anti-inflammatory foods such as berries, vegetables, fatty fish, and nuts into your diet can help reduce inflammation, which may alleviate symptoms of psoriasis.

\- **Healthy Fats**: Consuming healthy fats like avocados, nuts, and fatty fish provides essential fatty acids for maintaining healthy skin. These fatty acids help moisturize your skin, reduce inflammation, and protect against sun damage.

\- **Vitamin D and Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Supplementing with vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, found in cod liver oil, can help manage psoriasis symptoms. Vitamin D helps regulate T-cells, and omega-3s are potent anti-inflammatories that can reduce dry, scaly, and red skin.

\- **Bile Salts**: Bile salts stimulate vitamin D receptors, allowing vitamin D to work more effectively in the body, which can benefit psoriasis.

\- **Intermittent Fasting**: Combining intermittent fasting with a ketogenic diet can significantly lower insulin levels and improve skin conditions. Limiting your eating window each day gives your body a chance to rest and repair, which can benefit skin health.

By taking charge of your diet and incorporating these elements, you can actively manage symptoms of psoriasis and improve overall skin health. Remember, always consult with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for your individual needs.

## What Are The Healthy Habits That Will Help Me To Regulate What I Eat

# What are the healthy habits that will help me to regulate what I eat?

**Healthy Habits for Regulating Eating**

**Keto and Intermittent Fasting:** The ketogenic diet emphasizes high-fat, low-carb foods to promote fat burning, while intermittent fasting limits eating to specific time windows. Both approaches can help manage cravings and stabilize eating patterns by reducing insulin spikes and promoting stable blood sugar levels.

**Creating a Supportive Environment:** Establish a healthy eating environment by removing tempting snacks, meal-prepping nutritious options, and surrounding yourself with supportive individuals. These steps can simplify maintaining healthy eating habits.

**Fasting Benefits:** Fasting can enhance self-control, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and boost brain function. While not suitable for everyone, it can be a powerful tool for regulating eating habits and supporting overall health.

**Food Logging:** Keeping a detailed food journal helps identify eating patterns and triggers, providing insights for making more intentional food choices and improving dietary habits.

## Link Between Diet And Neurological Disorders

# Link Between Diet and Neurological Disorders

## **Link Between Diet and Neurological Disorders**

Diet can have a profound impact on neurological health. Diet has a noticeable impact on neurological conditions, particularly [Alzheimer's](https://www.drberg.com/blog/alzheimers-simplified) and [dementia](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-6-warning-signs-of-dementia).

### **Alzheimer's Disease, Insulin Resistance, and Glucose Starvation**

The brain relies heavily on glucose for energy. However, when insulin resistance occurs due to poor dietary choices like consuming excessive sugar or refined carbs, it can lead to what we call 'glucose starvation' in the nerves.

This starvation scenario, where neurons are deprived of essential fuel, has been linked directly with Alzheimer's disease. So you see how your dinner plate might be affecting your cognitive health.

### **The Connection Between Gluten and Dementia**

Gluten isn't just about avoiding bread for those wanting to lose weight. It may seem harmless, but gluten sensitivity could potentially trigger gut problems that affect more than just digestion.

Studies suggest a correlation between these gluten-triggered gut issues and an increased risk of dementia - surprising, right? While research is ongoing, reducing gluten intake seems sensible for your belly and possibly for protecting against neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia.

## **Wild-Caught Salmon: A Superfood for the Brain**

For optimal brain health, wild-caught salmon should be the food of choice. But why is it considered so beneficial?

![Wild pacific salmon](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/atlantic-salmon.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

### **Nutrient Profile of Wild-Caught Salmon**

The secret lies in its rich nutrient profile. Packed with Omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA and EPA, salmon provides essential building blocks for neurotransmitters - those vital messengers in our brain.

These Omega-3s improve memory, learning capacity, and mood and help lower inflammation and insulin resistance, which are detrimental to our cognitive functions.

Besides these benefits, another advantage of incorporating wild-caught salmon into your diet is its keto-friendly. This means it can provide [ketones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-a-ketone) as an alternative fuel source for the brain when you're on a [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/categories/ketogenic-diet) or[practicing intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/categories/intermittent-fasting).

Last but certainly not least is astaxanthin – this pink pigment found abundantly in wild-caught salmon is a powerful antioxidant that shields neurons from damage by free radicals.

## How Can I Avoid Compromising My Training While Fasting And What Should 57Edbf

# How can I avoid compromising my training while fasting and what should I consume after a fast?

Fasting can actually enhance recovery from exercise by countering some of the damage caused by physical activity. Exercising in a fasted state may offer additional benefits, and monitoring your recovery through sleep quality, soreness, or heart rate variability can be helpful.

After a short fast (1-2 days), there's little risk in what you consume post-fast, especially if you've been eating well. However, for longer fasts (3-5 days), be cautious when reintroducing carbohydrates, as a rapid intake can cause an electrolyte imbalance. It's best to break a prolonged fast with smaller portions of food to ease your body back into normal eating.

## Is It Advisable For Those With Gilberts Syndrome To Follow A Ketogenic F41E5B

# Is it advisable for those with Gilbert's syndrome to follow a ketogenic diet and fasting?

When following a ketogenic diet, it's essential to prioritize nutrient-dense, high-quality ingredients, even if you have specific health conditions. Keto primarily involves reducing carbohydrate intake, but this does not inherently guarantee the use of healthy foods. Incorporating intermittent fasting alongside a well-structured ketogenic approach can enhance overall health benefits. In fact, I find it difficult to identify any scenarios where this combination would be contraindicated, even during pregnancy or lactation. However, while keto may be beneficial, intermittent fasting might not be appropriate for all individuals in those situations.

## Is The Ketogenic Diet A Suitable Option For Weight Gain

# Is the ketogenic diet a suitable option for weight gain?

While the ketogenic diet is often associated with weight loss, it can also offer benefits for overall health beyond just managing weight. Low-carb diets and intermittent fasting can significantly support liver health and metabolic function. However, if your goal is to gain weight on a keto diet, it requires careful planning.

To maintain or gain weight, you'll need to increase your caloric intake while ensuring your dietary fat is at an appropriate level. Consuming sufficient dietary fat is essential for producing ketones; otherwise, your body may resort to burning its own fat for energy, which can lead to weight loss rather than gain.

To achieve this, consider adding healthy fats at the end of your meals, such as macadamia nuts, pecans, or desserts made with raw cream or MCT oil. Additionally, focus on strength training exercises with lower repetitions and higher volume. This approach can help you build muscle mass and strength while following a ketogenic diet, allowing you to effectively increase your weight in a healthy manner.

## What Strategies Can Help Balance Omega 3 And Omega 6 Fatty Acids In Th 25A050

# What strategies can help balance Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids in the diet, and why is this balance important for overall health?

The omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is way off in the average diet. The average American is at a 20:1 and sometimes a 70:1 or more omega-6 to omega-3 ratio!

**We need both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, but we need significantly more omega-3 fatty acids to avoid inflammation.** The source is important! You don’t want to get your omega-6 fatty acids from seed oils.

Omega-6 consumption from seed oils directly correlates with chronic illnesses like heart disease. Very recently in human history, seed oils replaced saturated fat in the diet and are in every ultra-processed food. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids include fatty fish, cod liver oil, cod liver, sardines, and shellfish.

**Grain-fed animals are much higher in omega-6 fatty acids. This is one of the reasons people are turning to grass-fed, grass-finished beef.**

Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids go through the same biochemical pathways and compete with each other in the body. If there’s any problem in these biochemical pathways, you can end up with dysfunctional fats that your body will be unable to benefit from.

Co-factors for these biochemical pathways include magnesium, vitamins B2, B3, B6, vitamin C, and insulin. Many people are insulin resistant, which means they’re deficient in insulin. Seed oil consumption paired with insulin resistance causes a lot more compound damage.

**Intermittent fasting and a low-carb diet can correct insulin resistance so you’re better able to utilize fatty acids within the body and don’t end up with dysfunctional fats.**

Omega-3 fatty acids fall into two categories: DHA and EPA. EPA helps reduce inflammation, and DHA helps support cognitive function. ALA is a precursor to EPA.

There’s a simple blood test that can measure your omega-3 to omega-6 ratio.

## What Supplements Are Recommended For Supporting Skin Health In Individ A1209E

# What supplements are recommended for supporting skin health in individuals with vitiligo, and how do they contribute to the management of this condition?

Vitiligo is a depigmentation problem. You lose your skin pigment in certain areas of your body. The cells in control of the skin pigment—known as melanocytes—have stopped functioning properly.

This condition is often associated with autoimmunity. Those with vitiligo may have other autoimmune conditions. Vitiligo is associated with a large amount of free radical damage. ROS and hydrogen peroxide cause a lot of oxidation.

Zinc and copper are involved in a very powerful antioxidant called SOD (superoxide dismutase).

Light therapy may be used to combat vitiligo. A pilot study showed that when vitiligo patients take 35,000 IUs of vitamin D, 14 out of 16 see significant repigmentation.

**There are three supplements you can take for vitiligo:**

1\. Zinc - 100 mg

2\. Vitamin D - 35,000 IUs

3\. Copper - 1500 mcg

**Fasting may also benefit those with vitiligo since it’s related to autoimmunity.**

## Under What Specific Circumstances Can Autophagy Be Enhanced Or Regulated

# Under what specific circumstances can autophagy be enhanced or regulated?

Autophagy is the body's process of recycling damaged proteins and addressing certain microbes and pathogens, thereby generating new proteins and fuel. It's essential for maintaining cellular health and has notable preventative benefits, including cleaning up damaged mitochondria.

Recent cancer therapies aim to inhibit autophagy, as cancer cells can exploit this process for resources. Despite this, promoting autophagy through prolonged fasting is beneficial, even in cancer cases, due to the numerous positive genetic effects it induces against cancer. Encouraging autophagy is advantageous for overall health and cancer prevention.

## What Strategies Can I Employ To Effectively Extricate Myself From Any  Cb09A6

# What strategies can I employ to effectively extricate myself from any stressful situation and regain composure?

This simple stress-release technique works fast, is free, and has many health benefits. It will help balance the parasympathetic nervous system, which is all about “rest and digest.” This easy breathing technique is based on a book called Heart Coherence 365.

**What you need to remember is 365, which stands for:**

• 3 times a day

• 6 breaths per minute

• 5 minutes

Three times a day, you’re going to take six breaths per minute for five minutes. It’s important to make sure you take deep, even breaths through your nose using your stomach. You should feel your diaphragm going out and in. This breathing technique for stress can also help improve HRV (heart rate variability). HRV has a lot to do with your health and fitness reserves. An HRV (heart rate variability) device can help you better understand and improve your health and nervous system balance.

## What Are The Potential Health Benefits And Therapeutic Advantages Of C 8Abf22

# What are the potential health benefits and therapeutic advantages of chromium picolinate supplementation?

Chromium is a trace mineral needed in tiny amounts.  Insulin resistance is a situation where the receptors for insulin are resisting insulin; this then tells the pancreas to make more insulin. So, now you have high levels of insulin, but the insulin is ineffective. 

**There are a lot of side effects of having high insulin, such as:**

• Prediabetes

• Diabetes

• Belly fat

• Artery problems

• Eye problems 

• Kidney problems

• Heart problems

• Brain problems

• And more

**A few things chromium can do:** 

1\. Increase glucose transporters

2\. Decrease stress in endoplasmic reticulum

3\. Inhibit inflammation and oxidative stress 

4\. Increase glutathione 

**Benefits of chromium picolinate:**

1\. It can decrease cravings

## What Exercises Do You Recommend For Flabby Arm Fat

# What exercises do you recommend for flabby arm fat?

**The main reason that people tend to have fat arms is the loss of collagen, which happens over a period of time as a person grows older. Out of all the hormones, the growth hormone tends to be the single most critical factor that is responsible for losing arm fat. In adults, the growth hormone controls factors such as fat burning, tightening muscles, protein synthesis, energy. The major causes of flabby arms are lower levels of growth hormone and high cortisol levels.**

To lose arm fat and avoid loose skin one must lower cortisol levels and raise the growth hormone. Lower cortisol levels can be achieved by low-intensity exercises (walking), sleeping, avoid stress, potassium foods, avoid sugar. Higher growth hormone can be achieved by high-intensity exercises, sleeping, proteins, avoid sugar.

**Loose skin normally stems from a loss of collagen, which occurs when the adrenal glands become stress.** This is common during and after menopause, primarily because the adrenal glands act as a backup gland for the ovaries. The buffer for cortisol is GH (Growth Hormone) and as GH drops, there is nothing left to counter the bad effects of cortisol.

**LOWER CORTISOL**

1\. Low-intensity exercise

2\. Increase sleep

3\. Support adrenal gland

4\. Avoid stress

5\. Increase potassium

6\. Increase B vitamins

7\. Avoid sugar

**RAISE GROWTH HORMONE**

1\. High-intensity exercise

2\. Increase sleep

3\. Increase some protein (not more than 6 ounces per meal)

4\. Intermittent fasting - only 3 meals per day - no snacks

5\. Decrease Cortisol and insulin

6\. Support the liver

## What Effective Strategies And Approaches Can Be Employed To Address Fe E6520A

# What effective strategies and approaches can be employed to address feelings of weakness?

Weakness in simple words means lack of energy. Additional symptoms of weakness can include fatigue, feeling tired, etc. If you have any of the above symptoms, let’s find and remedy the most common causes for weakness.

**Cause 1: High-carb diet**

When you are on a high-carb diet you may often feel weak and tired. The reason behind this is that when you consume carbs, your blood sugar goes high. Although you may feel energetic, the feeling will go away very fast. Your body will produce insulin, which in its turn will lower the blood sugar, causing you to crave food and feel weak.

Additionally, consuming sugar in general will instantly make your body weaker! You can watch this video and try the experiment.

**Cause 2: Stress**

If you have chronic stress, it can wear your body out. Lack of sleep or vitamin B1 deficiency can lead to poor tolerance of stress and the inability of stress-regulating organs to work properly. These can definitely cause weakness.

## What Are The Underlying Factors That May Contribute To A Childs Overwe 83Cb6A

# What are the underlying factors that may contribute to a child's overweight status?

**Consuming too many carbohydrates might be number two, but the number one reason is snacking.** 

The problem with snacking is that you have various hormones that are secreted in your stomach and small intestine that will stimulate insulin after you eat. Snacking in-between the meals could keep insulin high. Insulin actually prevents the loss of fat, as well as causes the storage of fat. 

**The most common snacks kids are fed:**

1\. Flavored yogurt—3.5oz has about 13g of sugar

2\. Popcorn—very high on the glycemic index

3\. Applesauce—very high on the glycemic index

4\. Energy bar—a granola bar could have 19g of net carbs 

5\. Juice—very high on the glycemic index

6\. Crackers and peanut butter—can be very high on the glycemic index

7\. Apples—on average contain around 19g of sugar 

**What you could do:**

• Don’t keep any snacks that are high in carbohydrates in the house.

• Make a transition to no snacking using healthier snacks first. 

• Ideally, don’t give the child any snacks. Give them 3 nutrient-dense meals, with enough calories and healthy fats.

## Is It Advisable To Take Niacin And Tudca Together And What Are The Pot 1Cc099

# Is it advisable to take niacin and TUDCA together, and what are the potential benefits or interactions between these two supplements?

Niacin and TUDCA should only be taken together if there is a specific concern. TUDCA, a bile salt containing choline, aids digestion and breaks down cholesterol. If you follow a healthy ketogenic diet with low carbs and intermittent fasting, you typically don't need to worry about cholesterol. Issues arise when the diet is not followed strictly, or if carbohydrates are still being consumed.

## Is There A Time Period That I Should Be Following Keto And Intermitten 97D6F3

# Is there a time period that I should be following Keto and Intermittent Fasting?

**The ketogenic diet is a lifelong commitment. Healthy keto with intermittent fasting will work while you do it, but the benefits will stop if you stop. You might see some awesome keto diet results, or intermittent fasting results and think it’s ok to stop. But, the long term effects of keto are so beneficial, you really don’t want to stop.**

The purpose of doing the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting is for so much more than just weight loss. Doing keto long term is a way of eating to minimize health problems.  You will eventually build up your health reserve, and you will be able to go off of the program here and there. But, there are no phases of the ketogenic diet. After you reach your keto weight loss goal, instead of adding in carbs, you can add in more calories and more fat.

There are multiple incredible benefits of healthy keto, ketosis, and intermittent fasting. Ketones are a more efficient fuel that your brain and heart prefer. But, one of the biggest problems out there right now is high insulin.

**Healthy keto with intermittent fasting will help you reduce your insulin, which will benefit your:**

• Heart

• Liver

• Brain

• Hormones

• Immune System

• Nerves

• Kidneys

• Eyes

Chromium is a trace mineral needed in tiny amounts. 

Insulin resistance is a situation where the receptors for insulin are resisting insulin; this then tells the pancreas to make more insulin. So, now you have high levels of insulin, but the insulin is ineffective. 

**There are a lot of side effects of having high insulin, such as:**

• Prediabetes

• Diabetes

• Belly fat

• Artery problems

• Eye problems 

• Kidney problems

• Heart problems

• Brain problems

• And more

**A few things chromium can do:** 

1\. Increase glucose transporters

2\. Decrease stress in endoplasmic reticulum

3\. Inhibit inflammation and oxidative stress 

4\. Increase glutathione 

**Benefits of chromium picolinate:**

1\. It can decrease cravings 

2\. It can help get you into keto faster 

3\. It can be beneficial for those with PCOS

## Why Would Triglycerides Elevate On Keto

# Why would triglycerides elevate on Keto?

Normally, your triglycerides should be low, but if they’re high, there could be several reasons why. 

Your fat is a storage place for triglycerides. When you do keto, the triglycerides are mobilized, and they come out of the fat cell. They’re there to be used as energy. 

I believe fasting 12-14 hours before you get your triglycerides tested is very important. This way, the test isn’t affected by what you just ate or drank that may have temporarily caused your triglycerides to be higher. Consuming alcohol or carbs two days before the test can also cause your triglycerides to be temporarily high. 

**A few potential causes of high triglycerides:** 

• A hypothyroid condition 

• A problem with the gallbladder 

• The transitional phase of keto 

• Hidden carbohydrates 

• Hidden fats

## Is Fever Beneficial To The Body

# Is fever beneficial to the body?

Fever is a natural defense mechanism that helps the body fight infections by mobilizing white blood cells and speeding up recovery. Attempting to reduce a fever immediately can prolong the illness. Natural approaches to support the body during fever include taking appropriate nutrients like calcium lactate and trace minerals, and occasionally fasting. It's important to monitor fever levels and seek medical advice if they exceed specific thresholds based on age. Additionally, factors like body temperature variations, dietary influences, sleep conditions, and smoking can affect overall body temperature regulation.

## What Are The Potential Reasons And Considerations For Avoiding The Use A1D155

# What are the potential reasons and considerations for avoiding the use of valerian root before sleep?

**Valerian Root: Helps with Anxiety, Not So Much with Sleep**

Valerian root is a natural herb with calming effects. It works similarly to medications like Valium by influencing GABA, a neurotransmitter that reduces stress and promotes relaxation. This can be helpful for anxiety, but there's a catch:

- **Valerian's Sedative Effects:** While it calms anxiety, valerian can cause drowsiness, sluggishness, even insomnia for some. It's NOT a reliable sleep aid.

**Getting to the Root Cause**

Anxiety and sleep problems are often symptoms of deeper imbalances:

- **Hormones:** High cortisol (the stress hormone) is a major culprit.

- **Melatonin/Serotonin Connection:** Low melatonin affects sleep, and can also contribute to low serotonin, linked to depression.

**Natural Solutions: Beyond Supplements**

While you CAN supplement melatonin, it's best to support your body's own production. Here's how:

1. **Exercise:** Gets your body primed for healthy sleep cycles.

2. **Sunlight:** Infrared rays naturally boost melatonin.

3. **Vitamin B1:** Found in nutritional yeast, sunflower seeds. Supports overall nervous system health.

4. **Gut Health:** Probiotics support the production of calming neurotransmitters.

5. **Diet:** Healthy keto and intermittent fasting can benefit hormone balance.

**Important:**

- Valerian may interact with medications. Talk to your doctor before using.

- Lifestyle changes take time but have lasting benefits.

## What Are The Common Causes Of Low Blood Pressure

# What are the common causes of low blood pressure?

Low blood pressure can cause a lot of problems if the causes are unknown and only symptoms are treated. Let’s take a look at common reasons behind it.

**Cause #1: Postural hypotension (POTS)**

Postural hypotension (or POTS) is a condition where, if you stand up too fast, you feel dizzy. This condition is linked to the low blood sugar that can result when your stress-regulating glands (adrenals) are worn out or you are deficient in vitamin B1. When weak adrenals or deficiency in B1 bring about low blood sugar, it can show up as POTS.

**Remedies:**

- Take vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

- Avoid refined carbs and sugar (they deplete you of vitamin B1)

- Avoid alcohol (depletes you of vitamin B1)

- Support your adrenals by doing the following:

    - improve sleep (take naps if needed)

    - regularly exercise (don’t overtrain)

    - take long walks outside (at least 45 minutes)

    - take magnesium

- take potassium

- You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support

- You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Cause #2: Dehydration**

If you don’t consume enough fluid in your diet this can result in dehydration of your body and, as a result, low blood pressure. Dehydration can be caused by vomiting, diarrhea, diuretics, not drinking enough fluid or lack of electrolytes (especially salt and potassium). Salt is very important for your body to be able to retain fluid, so make sure you are not deficient in it.

**Remedies:**

- Drink more fluids

- Take electrolytes high in potassium

- Consume more Himalayan sea salt

- Consume more vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)

- Avoid diuretics

**Other causes:**

- Medication (diuretics, antidepressants, HBP meds)

- Addison’s disease

- Iron deficiency (anemia)

- B12 and folate deficiency

- After eating your blood pressure can go low

## What Are The Key Techniques And Approaches For Stroke Recovery And Reh Ceb5F7

# What are the key techniques and approaches for stroke recovery and rehabilitation?

## **Understanding Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Techniques**

[Recovering from a stroke](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-to-do-after-a-stroke-important) is a complex process that requires a personalized approach. There's no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to stroke rehabilitation.

The most effective strategies involve a multifaceted approach that addresses both brain health and motor recovery. Let's explore some key techniques that can help optimize the stroke recovery process.

### **The Role of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Healing Brain Damage**

[Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-benefits-of-hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy) is a promising treatment for stroke recovery. It involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized chamber, which allows the lungs to gather more oxygen than possible at normal air pressure.

This increased oxygen supply can help heal damaged brain tissue by reducing inflammation, promoting new blood vessels' growth, and stimulating stem cell release.

While more research is needed, HBOT shows potential as a complementary therapy for stroke rehabilitation.

### **Ketones as an Alternative Fuel for Brain Recovery**

The brain typically relies on glucose for energy, but after a stroke, the brain's ability to use glucose may be impaired. This is where ketones come in.

[Ketones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-t-get-your-ketones-high-enough) are an alternative fuel source for the brain when glucose is unavailable. They can be obtained through a low-carb, high-fat diet, exogenous ketone supplements, [MCT oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-15-benefits-of-mct-or-medium-chain-triglyceride-oil), and intermittent fasting.

By providing the brain with an alternative energy source, ketones may help support brain function and recovery after a stroke.

## What Are The Most Important Benefits Of Apigenin

# What are the most important benefits of apigenin?

There is a powerful phytonutrient called apigenin, which comes from cruciferous vegetables, celery, parsley, certain teas and even wheatgrass juice. Apigenin is a flavonoid that is very common and widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Flavonoids are a class of naturally occurring phytochemicals that are found in plant tissues. Plants use flavonoids to protect themselves from pathogens and radiation from the sun. Additionally, they are used by the plants to regulate their own metabolism.

**Benefits**

- Induces autophagy

- Potent drug detoxifier

- Reverses the highest level of drug resistances with chemotherapy — making the medication more effective so you can take less

- Prevents kidney damage from drugs

- Stimulates neurogenesis

- Prevents plaquing in the brain

## What Are The Potential Reasons For Feeling The Need For An Afternoon Nap

# What are the potential reasons for feeling the need for an afternoon nap?

Need for an afternoon nap can create difficulties in your day. The important thing to know is that it is a condition which is connected to your blood sugars. Fixing your diet will remedy the need for naps during the day.

**Cause #1: Blood sugar crash**

Consuming carbs and sweets will increase blood sugar. Your body will lower the blood sugar amounts below normal levels by producing Insulin (fat-storing hormone). As a result, low blood sugar will cause sleepiness, low energy as well as will cause you to feel hungry, even though you just ate recently. This can be the cause of needing to nap during the day.

**Cause #2: Low stomach acid**

We need high stomach acidity to be able to break down and digest the load of food that we consume. If your stomach is not acidic enough, this can result in the food just sitting there in the stomach and not being digested fast enough. This can cause afternoon sleepiness.

**Cause #3: Poor quality of sleep**

If you had a bad night of sleep this can result in the need for an afternoon nap. If your sleep quality is high and you rest and recover well at night, then you will not feel sleepy during the day, provided that your blood sugar levels are normal and food is digested well.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Charley Horses

# What are the potential causes of charley horses?

A muscle cramp or charley horse is an uncontrolled muscle contraction that is sudden and painful. It often occurs during exercise or at night. Muscle cramps commonly occur in the calf muscle, but they can also occur in the foot and, occasionally, in the thigh.

**Cause #1: Magnesium and potassium deficiency (electrolytes)**

Magnesium and potassium are the electrolytes (electrically charged minerals) that are very important for correct muscle work and relaxation.

Magnesium is the relaxation mineral. Having enough of it will prevent cramps from occurring as your muscles will be naturally relaxed.

Potassium is responsible for high cellular energy as well as relaxation of the body in general-- along with many other functions. Your body needs 4,700 mg of potassium daily, which is about 7 to 10 cups of vegetables a day.

**Remedies:**

- Consume magnesium-rich foods

- Consume vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)

- Consume magnesium and potassium supplements

- Take apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water) to improve the absorption of calcium and magnesium

**Cause #2: Too much calcium**

Too much calcium in the diet can cause a lot of calcium residue in your muscle tissues as well as in your joints. Calcium does cause contraction of the muscles, and if you have an excess of it, it can cause cramps. Additionally, sometimes you may consume moderate amounts of calcium and still get cramps; this could be because calcium is not absorbed properly and not mobilised to the bones once it is absorbed. In this case you can take vitamin D and K2.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid calcium carbonate

- Consume vitamin D3 and K2

- Consume natural sources of calcium (like european cheese, kefir, etc.)

**Cause #3: Alkalosis**

If you have too alkaline a body pH it can result in muscle cramps. The reason behind it is that when your body pH is higher than normal it can result in inability to utilize the free calcium that is in your body. Calcium, in the right amounts and correctly utilized by your body, is needed for healthy muscle contractions. The solution would be to acidify your body.

**Remedies:**

- Take apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water, with your meals)

- Take betaine hydrochloride

- You can also drink these acidifiers:

    - kombucha tea

    - pickle juice

- Take potassium

- Avoid antacids

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

- Avoid tap water (use a filter if needed)

**Other causes:**

- Medication for high blood pressure

- Medication for high cholesterol

- Prednisone

## What Are The Possible Reasons For Excessive Thirst

# What are the possible reasons for excessive thirst?

Increased thirst is a condition where you are more thirsty than normally. It usually happens with frequent urination. This can create a problem as you can lose your electrolytes fast.

**Cause #1: Diabetes / insulin resistance**

If you have insulin resistance or diabetes either can cause excessive thirst. This is because water follows blood sugar. Having these conditions you lose your water fast and the loss signals to your brain, causing you to want to drink more water.

**Cause #2: Potassium/Sodium imbalance**

Having a balanced ratio of sodium-potassium is needed for proper hydration in the body. Normally the ratio should be about 4,700 mg of potassium to 1,000 mg of sodium per day, a 4.7 to 1 ratio. If you have high amounts of sodium, this can create potassium deficiency symptoms; and it applies the opposite way too.

**Cause #4: Too much calcium**

When you consume too much calcium or you have too much calcium in the body this is the condition called hypercalcemia. One of its side effects is frequent urination and excessive thirst.

**Cause #5: Certain drugs and medicines**

If you consume certain drugs, psych drugs, diuretics or even steroids they can cause your body to lose fluid or you may have excessive thirst as one of their side effects.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Elevated Creatinine Levels In The Blood

# What are the potential causes of elevated creatinine levels in the blood?

Creatinine is a waste product of creatine in your body. Creatine is a protein compound that supports your muscle and brain metabolism. Normally, your body gets rid of creatinine through your urine. However, if it’s backing up in your blood, there could be different causes.

**Symptoms:**

- Nausea

- Chest pain

- Muscle cramps

- Vomiting

- Fatigue

- Changes in urination frequency and appearance

- High blood pressure

- Swelling or fluid retention

- Itchiness

**Cause #1: Too much protein in your diet**

If you consume too much protein in your diet, and/or consume a lot of cooked meat, this can cause high levels creatinine in the blood.

**Cause #2: Intense exercise**

Intense exercise can cause high blood creatinine as well. This is because creatinine will be produced by your muscle as a result of protein metabolism.

**Cause #3: Inflammation/injury**

An inflammatory condition, whether from an injury or not, is another reason for high creatinine in your blood. Consuming vitamin D and doing intermittent fasting should help.

**Cause #4: Consuming creatine supplement**

Many people use creatine supplements to support their workouts and energy levels. If you consume too much creatine, it can cause high creatinine levels in your blood.

**Cause #5: Kidney problems**

If you have kidney damage, this could create high creatinine levels in the blood. If that’s the case, the solution would be to support your kidneys.

**Cause #6: Gallbladder/liver problems**

The gallbladder is very important for your digestive system. If none of the above causes relate to your condition, it could come from the gallbladder.

## What Causes Fever And What Are Some Natural Remedies To Handle It

# What causes fever and what are some natural remedies to handle it?

Fever is an increased body temperature. It is caused by your immune system as a way to fight internal infections. Let’s look at the common causes of fever and their remedies.

Symptoms

- High temperature

- Sweating

- Chills and shivering

- Headache

- Muscle aches

- Loss of appetite

- Irritability

- Dehydration

- General weakness

**Cause #1: Infection**

If your body is undergoing a viral or bacterial infection, this can trigger your immune system to create fever. Fever is a mechanism that helps your body to fight the harmful infection.

The solution would not be to suppress your fever with medication, but rather to strengthen your immune system and counter the virus with natural antibiotics. Fasting is one of the best ways to boost your immune system, and that will also speed up the process of getting your body back to normal.

**Cause #2: An autoimmune condition**

An autoimmune condition means your immune system is attacking your own healthy body cells. This can create inflammation and a fever as a result. Usually this stems from some kind of immune system confusion prior to that. Thus, strengthening your immune system as well as lowering the inflammation should help.

**Cause #3: Inflammatory condition**

If you have inflammation in some area of your body that is not going away, this in itself can cause a higher body temperature. Consuming foods that are inflammatory can cause this condition as well. The solution would be to reduce the inflammation.

## What Sardines Can I Eat On Keto

# What sardines can I eat on keto?

Always check the package to make sure that your sardines are in olive oil or water. Soybean oil is full of omega-6 fatty acids. This can nullify the benefits of the omega-3 fatty acids naturally found in sardines.

Soybean oil is the most used oil in America today. It’s also the second most used oil in the world.

Soybean oil is used in everything from fast food to animal feed to canned foods.

Research shows that soy oil can induce obesity and diabetes more than fructose. Soybean oil can also contribute to insulin resistance and fatty liver disease.

Soybean oil affects the hypothalamus, reduces oxytocin and influences over 100 genes in the brain.

Because soybean oil is so heavily processed, it acts as a powerful oxidizer, it is estrogenic, and it can induce inflammation–especially in your arteries.

If all of that isn’t bad enough, soybeans are also GMOs. This means they are exposed to the chemical glyphosate.

In summary, make sure that your sardines do not contain soybean oil. Instead, choose sardines in water or olive oil.

## Can I Consume An Antimicrobial Formula Containing Manuka Honey Without 7E50F6

# Can I consume an antimicrobial formula containing Manuka honey without disrupting the benefits of autophagy, especially during fasting or other autophagy-promoting practices?

No, consuming Manuka honey would inhibit the benefits of autophagy due to its fructose and glucose content, which can raise insulin levels. While honey has antimicrobial properties, other options, like celery, may be better suited if you're aiming to maintain autophagy. For antimicrobial benefits, consider alternatives that do not affect autophagy.

## How Does Synthetic Vitamin B12 Compare To Its Natural Counterparts In  859608

# How does synthetic vitamin B12 compare to its natural counterparts in terms of efficacy and absorption?

Cyanocobalamin is a synthetic version of vitamin B12. It's a very cheap version, and it's hiding in many fortified grain foods, synthetic vitamins, energy drinks, B12 injections, and even infant formulas. It's also typically present in very high doses in these products. The problem is that there is a cyanide molecule attached to the cobalamin. Cyanide shuts down the oxygen to your mitochondria.

**Potential side effects of cyanocobalamin:**

• Vomiting

• Stomach problems

• Low potassium

• Headaches

• Fever

• Dizziness

The best form of vitamin B12 is the natural version called methylcobalamin. This version is the active form of vitamin B12 and stays in the body longer than the synthetic versions.

**Potential benefits of methylcobalamin:**

• It may help improve sleep

• It can decrease the need for sleep

• It can help you wake up feeling alert and refreshed

• It can help you fall asleep faster

• It's great for the nervous system (especially the myelin sheath)

• It supports healthy eyes

• It increases melatonin

• It decreases homocysteine

• It can help regulate cortisol

• It supports the red blood cells

## Is Fasting Healthy For A Diabetic

# Is fasting healthy for a diabetic?

In the United States alone, there are about 84 million people who are pre-diabetic and 30 million who are diabetic. There is also a large number of people who have insulin resistance and are on their way to becoming a diabetic. 

**There are two main mechanisms with diabetes medications:**

1\. Targeting insulin resistance 

2\. Increasing insulin

The medications that increase insulin also increase the risk of cardiovascular mortality by 59-68%.  What you need to realize is that high insulin is just as damaging as high blood glucose. You need normal insulin, but you don’t need tremendous amounts of insulin. If you combine therapeutic fasting, where you’re making sure you’re getting all of your nutrients, with a low-carb diet—this can produce amazing results. 

**A few benefits of fasting for diabetics might be:**

1\. Within 4 months—no need for insulin 

2\. A decrease in A1C

3\. A decrease in waist size 

4\. Able to control blood sugars

## Whats The Biggest Benefit Of Fasting

# What's the biggest benefit of fasting?

One of the best benefits of fasting is a process known as autophagy. Autophagy is a process where cells recycle damaged components and eliminate pathogenic microbes like mold, viruses, fungi, bacteria, and candida. This mechanism is considered the ultimate anti-aging strategy, as it involves lysosomes, the cell's mini-garbage disposals, which clear out waste and send the particles to the liver for fuel or the creation of new cell parts.

## Are There Any Negative Aspects Of Intermittent Fasting

# Are there any negative aspects of intermittent fasting?

Intermittent fasting is very beneficial for people who are able to successfully implement it. It can lead to weight less, cell regeneration, less unhealthy cravings, better blood sugar control and much more.

While most people will gain great benefits from adopting intermittent fasting, women that are pregnant or breastfeeding should not adopt this eating pattern, as they require a higher level of nutrient intake. In addition, those with a history of eating disorders should not try intermittent fasting as it could trigger harmful tendencies. Aside from these groups, intermittent fasting is a transformative way of eating that can improve anyone's health and well-being.

## Should I Skip Breakfast When Im Fasting

# Should I skip breakfast when I'm fasting?

Skipping breakfast can be an excellent way to adjust your body to intermittent fasting and has many benefits. Because eating breakfast every morning can slow your metabolism, those looking to boost theirs may want to skip the first meal of the day.

Eating first thing in the morning also spikes your insulin, which halts the many benefits your body reaps overnight as you don't eat. And third, skipping breakfast can be beneficial because most typical breakfast foods are high in sugar and will cause your blood sugar to crash early in the day.

## Can A Ketogenic Diet Help Reverse Kidney Disease

# Can a ketogenic diet help reverse kidney disease?

High levels of glucose and insulin create oxidative damage to four tissues; brain (nerves), heart, eye, and kidney. B-hydroxybutyrate that is in ketone can provide an alternative fuel, it also has benefits for the kidney and decreases oxidative stress. Ketosis can counter the damage from a high-carb diet.

**Important Points:**

• Potassium is protective of the kidney

• Certain amino acids can slow progression of kidney damage

• It is important to consume nutrient-dense foods – it protects against the side effects and complications of the oxidation

• low carb diet – it is very beneficial to the kidney

***We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.***

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies For Managing And Reducing Alcoh Db599A

# What are the most effective strategies for managing and reducing alcohol cravings?

Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body. Glutamine turns into glutamate, which is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain.  L-glutamine increases gluconeogenesis, which is the production of new sugar. This means that this amino acid can quickly turn to sugar and feed your brain cells, but it won’t spike your insulin. 

Both sugar and alcohol can provide a sense of relief to some people. L-glutamine may help provide fuel to the brain and reduce stress, anxiety, and pressure—this may help reduce the need for alcohol and sugar. L-glutamine has many other potential health benefits, as well.  Alcohol consumption can block glutamine and all of the beneficial effects that come with it. 

**Foods rich in glutamine:** 

• Beef 

• Chicken 

• Fish 

• Eggs 

• Dairy 

• Cabbage 

• Dark leafy green vegetables 

**Other things that may help get rid of cravings for alcohol and sugar:** 

• Regular exercise without overtraining 

• Getting enough sleep 

• Reducing stress

• Consuming less alcohol 

• Get on the keto diet and do intermittent fasting

## What Are The Health Benefits Of Supplementing With Lactobacillus And B A49C03

# What are the health benefits of supplementing with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains?

Many times people will see a doctor because of depression, and the doctor will want to load them up on prescription medications. The problem is that in some situations, the person can never come off of the medication, and the medication can cause serious side-effects.

If you have depression, it may be beneficial to look at your diet and see what could be improved. You may want to consider the heathy keto diet and intermittent fasting. Vitamin D may also be beneficial. Something else that could be very important to do is to fix your gut. There is a huge connection between what’s going on in your large intestine and your overall mood.

It has been found that with major depressive disorder, there are high levels of certain microbes and low levels of other microbes in the gut. These microbes could have a huge influence on your overall mood. There is one microbe in particular that could have many different benefits for someone who is depressed. This microbe is called lactobacillus bifidobacterium.

Lactobacillus bifidobacterium can be found in foods like:

1\. Bulgarian yogurt (high-quality and high-fat yogurt)

2\. Kimchi

3\. Sauerkraut

4\. Cheese

5\. Kefir

6\. Pickles

This microbe could be beneficial because it helps make certain neurotransmitters like GABA and serotonin. Microbes like this one also make vitamins, including B1 and other B vitamins. If you can’t consume these foods on a regular basis, you could try taking a probiotic with lactobacillus in it.

## What Are Some Less Obvious Factors That Can Contribute To High Blood Pressure

# What are some less obvious factors that can contribute to high blood pressure?

9 reasons your blood sugar may be high:

1\. Cortisol: A morning cortisol spike can raise blood sugar.

2\. Low Blood Sugar: Hormonal overcompensation for low blood sugar can lead to high blood sugar.

3\. Late-Night Snacks: Carb-rich snacks can increase blood sugar.

4\. Previous Day's Sugar: Sugar consumed the day before can affect blood sugar the next day.

5\. Low Blood Pressure: Medications for low blood pressure can raise blood glucose.

6\. Stress: Stress and anxiety can elevate cortisol and blood sugar.

7\. Missed Meds: Forgetting medications can disrupt blood sugar levels.

8\. Nighttime Exercise: Exercising late may cause your body to overcompensate.

9\. Additives: MSG and artificial sweeteners can spike blood sugar. Addressing insulin resistance with healthy keto and intermittent fasting may help.

## What Are The Primary Causes Of Heart Palpitations

# What are the primary causes of heart palpitations?

Palpitations are either a skipped heartbeat, an extra pounding, or a speeding up of your heart rate. The rhythm of the heart is controlled by electrolytes (potassium, magnesium sodium, and calcium).

You can be deficient in these minerals if you omit them from the diet like not eating enough vegetables. You can also have insulin resistance and thereby not absorb electrolytes and develop palpitations. Insulin resistance also forces the body to make more insulin because it's now resistant. This is another reason why you see palpitations as a side effect of taking insulin. Or you can have low stomach acid and not absorb minerals. It takes an acidic stomach to absorb minerals. When you are low in stomach acids, you then get acid reflux (heart burning or GERD), and in fact, palpitations are one of the associative symptoms of having acid reflux and now you know why.

## What Are The Most Important Benefits Of Green Tea For Skin Health

# What are the most important benefits of green tea for skin health?

**Green tea is rich in polyphenols, which are phytonutrients. These are what give green tea its many benefits for reducing the signs of aging.**

1\. Green tea has powerful anti-photoaging properties, which means that it reduces the effects of UV light on skin aging.

2\. Green tea increases collagen and elastin fibers by suppressing enzymes that degrade collagen and elastin. This helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles and improve the overall health of your skin.

3\. Green tea has potent anti-inflammatory properties.

4\. Green tea has the ability to induce autophagy, which is the recycling of old, damaged proteins to use for new proteins.

5\. Green tea can promote ROS-scavenging enzymes, which help clean up free radicles that cause damage to your DNA. Green tea can also decrease the amount of hydrogen peroxide that the body creates, resulting in less oxidative stress.

6\. Green tea acts as a potent stress mediator, helping your body better resist the effects of stress.

7\. Green tea can potentially decrease both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer.

## Am I Still Getting The Benefits Of Intermittent Fasting If I Drink Cof F087D0

# Am I still getting the benefits of intermittent fasting if I drink coffee with some milk in the morning?

The impact of adding some milk to your morning coffee while intermittent fasting depends largely on the calorie content. A small amount is unlikely to significantly disrupt your fasting benefits. The key is to avoid excessive calories that could affect insulin levels. To maximize the benefits of intermittent fasting, it's also important to avoid snacking during your eating window. This helps maintain a lower insulin response and enhances the overall effectiveness of your fasting regimen.

## Nutrient Optimization During Fasting

# Nutrient Optimization During Fasting

While intermittent fasting can be a powerful tool for improving health, ensuring you're still meeting your body's nutritional needs during your eating windows is crucial.

Keeping an eye on consuming adequate amounts of some often-overlooked heroes – namely magnesium, potassium, and B vitamins– is crucial for staying healthy; they’re fundamental for ensuring everything inside us operates correctly.

Fasting may make your body more prone to nutrient deficiencies, particularly if you don't consume a proper diet during your eating windows.

Consider incorporating nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens, nuts, and seeds into your meals to help prevent deficiencies and support overall health.

Additionally, some people may benefit from supplementing with specific nutrients during their fasting journey.

For example, taking a high-quality magnesium supplement before bed can help support restful sleep and reduce muscle cramps, while consuming citrate-rich foods like lemon juice can help counter keto flu symptoms by promoting hydration and electrolyte balance.

## What Strategies Can I Implement To Avoid Weight Gain After Completing  4Df024

# What strategies can I implement to avoid weight gain after completing a ketogenic diet?

It is advisable to maintain carbohydrate intake at 50 grams or more per day, with protein consumption limited to a maximum of 8 ounces. For those practicing intermittent fasting, consuming two meals per day is recommended.

If there are no compelling reasons to discontinue the ketogenic diet, it may be beneficial to continue with it to reap its potential advantages.

## What Are The Benefits Of Insulin Beyond Glucose Regulation And How Doe 951C18

# What are the benefits of insulin beyond glucose regulation, and how does it support metabolic health and manage certain conditions?

The main reason why the keto diet and intermittent fasting work so well to support a healthy body is that they both help lower insulin. However, insulin has certain benefits. This is where the confusion starts. How can insulin be harmful and also have health benefits?

**Potential health benefits of insulin:**

• It helps lower blood sugar levels

• It supports muscle growth

• It protects against muscle atrophy

• It supports the arteries

• It helps lower LDL cholesterol

• It helps lower blood pressure

• It lowers the production of glucose in the liver

• It supports the absorption of potassium and magnesium

• It suppresses lipolysis

• It is a potent anti-inflammatory

• It has antioxidant properties

• Insulin nasal spray is used to help people who have dementia

• It helps increases testosterone

• It helps lower uric acid

The real problem is with the insulin receptors. When the receptors become resistant, as in insulin resistance, we lose the function of insulin. When someone has insulin resistance, they actually have an insulin deficiency. You may have excess insulin in your blood, but it’s not affecting the receptors. A high level of insulin is what creates insulin resistance. The more you increase insulin, the less the receptors will work.

## What Are Seven Effective Strategies To Significantly Boost Your Energy Levels

# What are seven effective strategies to significantly boost your energy levels?

**Beyond the Caffeine Buzz: Understanding Real Energy**

You're right! Coffee doesn't actually give you energy, it just masks tiredness for a while. And that sugar rush? It leads to an energy crash later. So, what can you do to boost your energy naturally and avoid that slump?

**7 Natural Energy Boosters**

1. **Mighty Magnesium:** This mineral is crucial for making ATP, the energy your body runs on. Think leafy greens, nuts, avocado, and fish for magnesium-rich fuel.

2. **Charge Up Your Cells:** Your cells have a "sodium-potassium pump" that generates power for your muscles and nerves. Make sure you get enough of these electrolytes through food or a supplement.

3. **Mighty Mitochondria:** These are your cells' powerhouses! Exercise, fasting, a splash of cold water, and colorful polyphenol-rich foods (think berries and dark chocolate) can all help you build more mitochondria for extra energy.

4. **Ketone Power:** A keto diet can switch your fuel source to ketones, which burn cleaner and more efficiently than glucose.

5. **Carnitine Kick:** This compound shuttles fat to your mitochondria for fuel. It helps you work out longer and recover faster. Red meat is a great source of carnitine.

6. **Apple Cider Vinegar Advantage:** Your mitochondria can use this tangy tonic as an extra energy source. A tablespoon in water daily might do the trick.

7. **B Vitamin Boost:** B vitamins support your mitochondria, helping them turn food into energy. Nutritional yeast is a tasty source of these power-packed vitamins.

## Do I Have To Eat More If Im Not Losing Weight

# Do I have to eat more if I'm not losing weight?

The reason that you're not losing weight is that you're not eating enough. So the solution is to just eat more food, right?

This just doesn't make any sense. How could adding more food cause you to lose calories?

**What you do want to do to support healthy weight loss is to increase your nutrients. Vitamins, minerals, and other vital nutrients can help support a healthy body and promote weight loss.**

**The best way to lose weight is to cut out your carbohydrates and eat less frequently.** This doesn't mean you need to lower your calories—just avoid any calories from carbohydrates and eat less often. What this does is decreases insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the cause of a slow metabolism.

**If you can't seem to lose weight, this is a sign of insulin resistance.** Chances are, you are eating way too many carbohydrates. Keep in mind that lowering your calories is not a good idea either. Lowering your calories can deplete the body of nutrients and low down your metabolism further. Avoid low-calorie diets! In summary, Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting are the best ways to lose weight and support a healthy body.

The ideal fasting process is by only consuming water but the important part is keeping the insulin levels low so if you consume something that would keep the insulin low, it is not going to interfere with the benefits of fasting.

**Things that will NOT affect insulin:**

1\. Fiber (green salad)

2\. Fat (MCT Oil, Butter, Coconut Oil, Whole Cream)

3\. Tea / Coffee

## Should I Do Juicing While On Keto Or While Fasting

# Should I do juicing while on Keto or while fasting?

In general, I do not think that juicing is the best idea on keto or while fasting—unless you’re doing a juice powder. Why? Because many vegetable juices can contain more carbs than you would expect. In turn, this can low down ketosis and weight loss.

When calculating the carbs in a vegetable, you want to subtract the fiber from the total carbs, which will give you the net carbs. Juicing removes the fiber from the vegetables, which means you can no longer subtract it from the total carbs. One cup of juice will have more net carbs than one cup of whole vegetable because of the fiber content.

Additionally, juicing can remove a lot of the phytonutrients in vegetables. Phytonutrients have powerful health benefits. If you find it difficult not to have juice because of cravings, try using inositol. This is a form of natural sugar alcohol (known as vitamin B8) that helps with insulin resistance. If you can repair insulin resistance, you will have a much easier time fighting off cravings.

Bile salts can also help reduce cravings. Bile helps you break down and absorb healthy fats that keep you feeling satisfied after eating.

## Can I Use Inositol For Pcos

# Can I use inositol for PCOS?

PCOS occurs when the androgen male sex hormones are too high in a women’s body. Symptoms include growing facial hair, developing belly fat, and hair loss on your head. You might get a deeper voice.

High levels of androgen are caused by high levels of insulin. So of course you want to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to lower your insulin levels. But there’s a little more to it.

There’s a vitamin called inositol that’s part of the vitamin B family. Interestingly, if you suck on it, it tastes sweet. Inositol is involved in sugar metabolism. Inositol is actually nine different vitamin B compounds, Two of the nine versions are called MYO and D-chiro. I and others believe that in women with PCOS, the MYO doesn’t convert to the d-chiro. So on top of the high levels of insulin and androgens, this contributes to the problem.

When you give women with PCOS a 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, their symptoms improve, as does their fertility, weight loss, acne, and the quality of their eggs. Find an inositol supplement that has this 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, to further enhance the benefits of keto and intermittent fasting. Inositol alone won’t completely help. You’ve got to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to get your insulin levels low enough to stop driving up your androgen levels.

## What Are The Most Effective Methods For Diminishing Acne Scars

# What are the most effective methods for diminishing acne scars?

If you have scarring from acne, one of the best things you can do is to use vitamin E oil.

When using vitamin E oil for acne scars on your face, you may want to use an organic, hexane-free version of vitamin E oil. Vitamin E can have a significant effect on fibrosis. It may actually help break down scar tissue.

Benefits of vitamin E for the skin:

- It’s a powerful antioxidant

- It’s fat-soluble (it goes into the skin)

- It’s an anti-inflammatory

- It can help break down scar tissue

- It can help with certain wrinkles

To use vitamin E oil for your skin, rub it into the skin for about one or two minutes right before you go to bed every night. Do it for about two or three weeks.

To kick things up a notch, you may want to combine the use of vitamin E oil with the Healthy Keto® diet, intermittent fasting, and periodic prolonged fasting. This combination might give you even better results because consuming a lot of carbs and frequent eating can block the effect of vitamin E and can make the skin age faster.

When you do fasting, especially prolonged fasting, your body goes through autophagy, which is a fantastic anti-aging action. You may want to do prolonged fasting once every two weeks or once a month for at least 72 hours.

## Why Is Dietary Fat Important

# Why is dietary fat important?

There are several reasons why you need dietary fat for a keto diet.

- Fat helps you fast longer (lowers hunger and cravings)

- Fat supplies you with nutrients (essential fats and fat-soluble vitamins)

- Fat stimulates bile

- Fat triggers healthy hormones

- Fat supplies your body with healthy tissue

- Fat slows the absorption of protein

- Fat helps you maintain your weight

The truth is, you don’t necessarily need to consume more fat on keto. Most of all, you need to lower your carbohydrates. Carbs affect insulin, and insulin blocks ketosis. The key is to lower your carbs.

Ketosis is also not a high-protein diet. You want to consume only a moderate amount of protein: 3 to 8 oz is fine. You also don’t want to consume lean protein – low-fat protein can exacerbate insulin spikes. Always consume full-fat foods.

## What Foods Should I Eat For Nails And Hair

# What foods should I eat for nails and hair?

If you want really nice healthy hair, healthy skin, and healthy nails, then you would want to consume healthy fats like avocado and eggs with the yolks. Not use them topically.

Avocados are loaded with carotenoids. Carotenoids are a fat-soluble phytonutrient. Because there is a good amount of fats in avocados, you’re going to absorb these phytonutrients much better. If you combine avocado and eggs, you will have even better absorption. Consuming eggs and avocados on the keto diet, while also doing intermittent fasting, can result in really nice hair, nails, and skin. 

**Avocado benefits for hair, skin, and nails:**

• Active vitamin A 

• B5

• B6

• Copper

• Folate

• Vitamin K

• Magnesium 

• Biotin 

• Vitamin E 

• Vitamin C 

• Antioxidant properties 

• Anti-inflammatory properties 

• Monosaturated fats

• Oleic acid — 68%

**Egg benefits for hair, skin, and nails:**

• Highest quality protein 

• All vitamins (except vitamin C)

• Minerals

• Trace minerals 

• Essential fatty acids 

• Phospholipids 

• Vitamins A, D, E

• Carotenoids 

• Omega 3

## What Are The Benefits Of Intermittent Fasting For Healthy Skin

# What are the benefits of intermittent fasting for healthy skin?

Intermittent fasting has many great benefits for the skin. For instance, it can delay vascular cell deterioration while preventing oxidative stress. It can also stimulate autophagy (cell repair) and boost stem cell production. It also lowers inflammation because glycogen in the skin is reduced. Anti-aging effects can be seen in the skin through fasting as well, because more elastin is produced by the body.

## What Happens With A Body During A Fast

# What happens with a body during a fast?

There are a wide range of benefits that the body experiences during a fast. After about 12 hours, the body begins to produce more growth hormone, which helps boost fat-burning, assists with protein synthesis, benefits joints, and can even have some anti-aging effects.

After about 18 hours of fasting, the body begins a process known as autophagy, which recycles old and damaged proteins and cells, turning them into new ones. After a day of fasting, the body will begin to burn fat instead of glygogen, antioxidant and oxygen reserves will increase, the cardiovascular system becomes more efficient, alongside many more benefits. Fasting over 48 or 72 hours can result in the production of more stem cells and better immune function. However, you should never begin a prolonged fast without consulting a medical professional first.

## Can I Eat Cauliflower On Keto

# Can I eat cauliflower on Keto?

What’s cool about cauliflower is that its low carb, and it tastes like a potato! It seems like a starchy food but without the starch. One cup has 2.6 grams of carbs, but 1.4 grams of fiber makes it a net carb amount of 1.2 grams.

Besides being low carb, cauliflower has a lot of vitamins, especially B vitamins and vitamin C, vitamin E, and vitamin K1. It also has many minerals and trace minerals, especially manganese which is a great antioxidant. But that’s not all. Cauliflower has some serious amounts of phytonutrients (as do all cruciferous vegetables). Phytonutrients act as specialized antioxidants that help with turning certain genes on and off, as well as the maintenance of your DNA.

Keep in mind that the longer you cook cauliflower, the more you destroy its nutrients. 3 minutes of boiling, for example, equals ten minutes of steaming. So steam it for just 5 minutes; but, the way I recommend is to saute it. Ultimately, even if you cook it for a relatively long time, you still get the benefits of cauliflower being a low-carb food along with its fiber. Sometimes when I go to a restaurant I find they have the entire head of cauliflower roasted with cheese on it! And I pretty much eat the whole thing. Cauliflower truly is the ultimate keto food!

## How Can I Permanently Stick To A Weight Loss Plan

# How can I permanently stick to a weight loss plan?

**The biggest reasons people can’t stick to a diet are #1 hunger and #2 cravings.** 

**There are two main hormones involved in hunger and cravings:**

1\. Ghrelin — This hormone makes you hungry, so we want to decrease it. 

2\. Leptin — This hormone makes you feel satisfied, so we want to increase it. 

**The best ways to stick with your eating plan and lose weight:**

• Get more sleep 

• Decrease sugar 

• Consume an adequate amount of protein

• Get plenty of fiber 

• Decrease stress 

• Avoid alcohol and smoking 

• Keep caffeine consumption to a minimum 

• Consume healthy fats 

• Eat slowly 

• Decrease carbohydrates 

• Take l-tryptophan (for cravings during menstrual cycles)

• Consume nutrient-dense foods 

• Do intermittent fasting

Gastric bypass and certain medications can also increase hunger. 

One of the big tips for sticking to diets and losing weight is to eat frequent small meals. But, every time you eat, you increase insulin.  In the presence of insulin, you can’t burn fat, and if you can’t burn fat, then you can’t lose weight. This can also cause insulin resistance, which can lead to a myriad of health concerns.  Eating less frequently, also known as intermittent fasting, is one of the best things you can do to lose weight and support your overall health. 

To stay satisfied between meals without eating snacks, you need to feed the cells your body fat (burn fat). But, to burn fat, you have to lower your insulin by lowering your carbohydrates and eating less frequently.  Once your body has adapted to burning fat, not only will you be able to lose weight, you will finally get rid of hunger and cravings for good.

## How Often Should You Take A Break From Keto

# How often should you take a break from keto?

Healthy Keto® with intermittent fasting will work while you do it, but the benefits will stop if you stop. You might see some awesome keto diet results, or intermittent fasting results, and think it’s okay to stop. But the long-term effects of keto are so beneficial, you really don’t want to stop or take a break.

The purpose of doing the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting is so much more than just weight loss. Doing keto long-term is a way of eating to minimize health problems. You will eventually build up your health reserve and you will be able to go off of the program here and there. But, there are no phases of the ketogenic diet. After you reach your keto weight-loss goal, instead of adding in carbs, you can add in more calories and more fat.

## What Can I Eat For Breakfast On Keto

# What can I eat for breakfast on keto?

You can consume bacon and eggs, or many other foods, as your first meal of the day. But it’s not recommended that you have a morning meal, because it will cause you to lose the benefits of the morning fasting time added to your fast during the night. Try to push your first meal to a little later in the day – even to noon or early afternoon.

Ideally, you would combine a ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting, to get the most benefits for health and weight loss.

Fat and fiber. Now I'm not talking about the fiber in whole grains or added synthetic fibers. I'm talking about fiber from vegetable and then fat as a pure fat.

**What food combinations would be a good combination to consume both fiber and fat if you're trying to keep your insulin low?** Well, what about a salad with olive oil? That would be a good one. Or maybe celery with peanut butter. Or even more tasty yet, some raw cream whipped into whipped cream and then some blueberries which has some fiber in it. These are just things that you can add to your diet either as a food or dessert. That will definitely help you keep that insulin lowered in addition to other benefits.
