## Does Soil Used In Farming Have All The Trace Minerals Your Body Needs

# Does soil used in farming have all the trace minerals your body needs?

Modern farming practices can lead to nutrient depletion in the soil. Often, farmers replenish only a few major minerals, neglecting trace minerals. Consequently, if the soil lacks trace minerals, the plants grown in it will also be deficient. This deficiency carries up the food chain to animals that consume these plants and ultimately to humans who eat these crops and animal products. Therefore, unless one regularly consumes sources like oysters, shellfish, and seafood, it is common to be deficient in trace minerals due to depleted soil.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Sore Bleeding Gums

# What are the potential causes of sore, bleeding gums?

Soreness or bleeding in the gums can create a lot of difficulties and discomfort. There is one main cause behind this problem. Let’s look at it.

Symptoms:

- Red gums

- Blood on toothbrush

- Sore gums

**Cause #1: Vitamin C deficiency**

Sore/bleeding gums can be caused by a vitamin C deficiency. A very important thing to know about vitamin C is that the most commonly sold version of it, called ascorbic acid, is only one fourth of the actual vitamin C complex. When you take only ascorbic acid you will deplete your body of the rest of the vital parts of actual vitamin C, and the result will not remedy sore or bleeding gums.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Elevated Creatinine Levels In The Blood

# What are the potential causes of elevated creatinine levels in the blood?

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/causes-of-high-creatinine-levels-in-blood-drberg-on-elevated-creatinine-levels)

There is something called creatine that converts to creatinine, which is a waste product. It’s supposed to go through the urine, but if it’s backing up into the blood, this can mean that there could potentially be a kidney problem or something else going on.

Creatine, in general, helps recycle ATP (an energy currency). Many people take creatine for their exercise performance.

**A few causes of high creatinine in the blood (but it’s low in the kidneys):**

1\. Kidney damage

2\. Ace inhibitors

3\. Intense exercise

4\. More muscle mass

5\. Too much dietary meat (cooked)

6\. Creatine supplements
