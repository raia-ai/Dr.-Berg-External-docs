## What Would Happen To Your Body If You Were Put On 48 Different Medications

# What would happen to your body if you were put on 48 different medications?

This is the average number of medications a person takes in an assisted living home in the United States. Hal Cranmer, owner of A Paradise for Parents, and Claud Covaci, CEO of Synkwise, weigh in on the true cost of healthcare.

Claud is the CEO of a software company that manages the medications people take in assisted living homes. In a sampling of 100 residents, the average resident is on 48 medications. Some residents were even taking up to 91 medications! This isn’t healthcare. In Hal’s assisted living homes, he implements programs to help people get off their medications. Many of his residents have seen a 50% decrease in medication usage. Hal focuses on diet and doesn't serve ultra-processed foods in his facilities.

Dementia is the top problem in assisted living homes and is extremely expensive, costing an average of $800,000 to $1.5 million per person. Hal explains that dementia starts in your 30s and 40s, so it’s a very difficult condition to reverse. Under Hal’s protocol, he has seen improvement, even in people with dementia.

The US healthcare system is focused on medicine, not food, but food is the most significant contributor to your health! Medications treat the side effects of junk food consumption, and the side effects of medications are then treated with more medication.

The ultimate goal should be to decrease medications, get people off them, and hopefully help them regain independence. The current healthcare model does not support these goals.

One record for a single patient shows they’re on medication for high blood pressure, cholesterol, tremors, blood clots, stool softeners, antidepressants, seizures, insulin, schizophrenia, runny nose, nausea, prostate enlargement, and more. This is insane!

Failing to address the diet before prescribing these medications misses the root cause of the problems.

## What Is Metabolic Adaptation

# What is metabolic adaptation?

### **Understanding Metabolic Adaptation**

Your body's metabolism is incredibly adaptable. When you change your diet or fasting routine, your metabolism adjusts accordingly. This process is known as metabolic adaptation.

[During ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-know-you-are-in-ketosis), your body shifts from using glucose as its primary fuel source to [burning fat for energy](https://www.drberg.com/blog/7-surprising-ways-to-speed-up-fat-burning-and-lose-weight-faster). This metabolic switch can initially lead to decreased energy levels as your body adapts to using fat for fuel.

However, as you become more fat-adapted, your energy levels stabilize, and you may experience increased mental clarity and physical endurance. [Intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/is-intermittent-fasting-okay-for-a-diabetic) also triggers metabolic changes.

When you fast, your body enters a ketosis metabolic state, breaking down fat for energy. This process can lead to increased fat burning and potential weight loss.

## What Is The Impact Of Frequently Alternating Between Being On And Off  Ca4766

# What is the impact of frequently alternating between being on and off a ketogenic diet?

While engaging in a ketogenic diet, even intermittently, can yield benefits compared to not following any dietary plan, there are notable considerations. Each time you return to a ketogenic regimen, you may find it increasingly challenging to achieve the same results as before. This is often due to the development of insulin resistance, which can complicate the effectiveness of the diet over time. Therefore, consistency in following the ketogenic principles may be crucial for sustained progress.

# Is coffee going to affect my insulin?

It's not going to affect your insulin. If you can handle 3 cups of coffee and if you sleep okay should be fine because the biggest problem with the caffeine is if your liver is really strong and it can detoxify the caffeine and you can sleep go for it. But if you start having it affect your sleep, then we know that's the issue.

## What Strategies Can Be Implemented To Prevent Fatty Liver Disease Whil 65D340

# What strategies can be implemented to prevent fatty liver disease while losing weight?

In the book of medical physiology, there’s a section that says, “Effect of insulin lack on causing a fatty liver. Strange as it may seem, though insulin lack causes dissolution of the fat store in adipose tissue, it causes a great increase in the amount of stored triglycerides in the liver, leading to a very fatty liver.”

This means that when you lower your insulin and start burning a lot of fat, you are at risk of making your liver fatty. There are two things I want to cover on how to avoid a fatty liver when you lose weight.

**#1 You have to keep your diet high in vegetables. You need at least 7-8 cups of vegetables a day. Vegetables help clean the liver and prevent fat build-up. Avoid corn and have raw leafy greens. Kale shakes are great for getting more vegetables in your diet.**

**#2 Have apple cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar is really really good for the liver and to help dissolve a fatty liver and clean it up.**

Egg yolks are also very good for cleaning up a fatty liver. They contain B vitamins (choline) and Lecithin.

## What Are The Initial Signs And Symptoms That May Indicate The Onset Of 021107

# What are the initial signs and symptoms that may indicate the onset of dementia, and how can they manifest in daily life?

**They can be:**

1\. A loss of spatial navigation (like forgetting where you parked your car)

2\. Difficulty finding the right words

3\. Confusion

4\. Repeating yourself

The first thing you want to do if you are experiencing dementia symptoms is to start feeding your brain ketones. This will help bypass the degraded glucose absorption mechanism that is starving your brain of fuel and begin to feed the neurons directly.

**There are three ways you can increase your ketones:**

1\. Lower your carbs

2\. Do intermittent fasting

3\. Supply your body with healthy fats, like MCT oil and fatty fish

## What Is Cortisol Resistance

# What is cortisol resistance?

Insulin resistance is a prediabetic state. Any time there is a resistance situation, you have a hormone that’s not going into the cells properly. The receptor that is supposed to receive the hormone is resistive, and it’s blocking the hormone from going in. With this situation, you can have a lot of the hormone in the body, but you’re not getting the effect of the hormone. You can actually have symptoms of too much of the hormone and a deficiency of the hormone at the same time. 

Cortisol is a stress hormone. It counters and deals with stress. When you have stress over a long period of time, the receptor that’s supposed to receive that hormone starts to block it.

## What Is A Gallbladder Attack

# What is a gallbladder attack?

The liver makes bile that travels down through small tubes to be stored in the gallbladder. Usually a gallbladder attack is when a stone gets stuck in one of the small tubes, resulting in pressure that is going to cause a lot of pain and inflammation.

Symptoms

- Stomach pain

- Nausea

- Right shoulder pain

- Pain under right rib cage

- Inability to digest fats

- Bloating

**Cause #1: Gallstones**

A gallstone is mostly made of cholesterol. However, your body needs a certain amount of cholesterol. Gallstones form in the liver/gallbladder ducts. This can create pressure in the ducts and can cause a lot of pain. If you go on a low-fat diet, your risk of gallstones actually goes up. A lack of bile is what causes these stones to form.

**Too much insulin** can deplete your bile reserves and that can result in stone formation in the ducts.

**Too much cortisol** can shut down bile production, causing the formation of stones. **Too much estrogen** can cause stone formation as well.

## Can You Eat As Much As You Want On Keto

# Can you eat as much as you want on keto?

A keto diet does not necessarily say how large you should make the meals you consume. It is recommended, though, that you consume enough to feel satisfied.

If you eat too much and snack often, even using keto-friendly ingredients, you will slow down your weight loss, as your insulin will be high. For the best results, it’s recommended that you follow the Healthy Keto® diet with an intermittent fasting plan.

## I Have Really Bad Acne. Will Keto Help Me With This

# I have really bad acne. Will keto help me with this?

The Healthy Keto® diet can effectively address acne, eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, and other skin issues by regulating hormonal imbalances. These conditions often stem from high androgen levels, which can lead to increased oil production in the skin and consequently, acne. Insulin plays a significant role in triggering androgens, and its reduction through the combination of keto and intermittent fasting (IF) can help lower androgen levels. IF complements keto by further reducing insulin, offering a powerful approach to managing skin problems by addressing hormonal imbalances.

## Do I Eat Less Or More Calories On Intermittent Fasting

# Do I eat less or more calories on intermittent fasting?

**If someone is struggling to lose weight, they typically reduce the calories and end up finding that it will not work.**

Lowering the calories does eventually lower your metabolism. Yet, if you compare spreading your calories out with three meals with two snacks on a 1500 calories per day diet with an increase in calories (2000) for a given day - but ONLY consume two meals per day, you will lose more weight.

**The reason for this is twofold:**

1\. Every time you eat, you stimulate insulin. And insulin is the hormone that blocks fat burning and weight loss.

2\. In the presence of only a tiny excess of insulin above normal will nullify and block fat burning.

## Is Keto Effective Without Intermittent Fasting

# Is Keto effective without intermittent fasting?

While keto is an effective diet that can improve overall health and reduce insulin resistance on its own, it is much more effective when combined with intermittent fasting. Even on a low-carb diet, the more often you eat, the more often you are raising your insulin levels. Intermittent fasting helps keep insulin levels low, making sure you stay in ketosis and lose weight more effectively. Intermittent fasting will also help you break any snacking habits you may have, further increasing the effectiveness of your keto diet.

## How Can I Lose Weight With Intermittent Fasting

# How can I lose weight with intermittent fasting?

Intermittent fasting is a pattern of eating and not eating that doesn't dictate specific foods or calorie reduction but instead focuses on when you eat. It's a crucial factor in weight loss, influencing growth hormone stimulation for anti-aging and fat burning while decreasing insulin levels, which is essential for weight loss. Intermittent fasting can also aid in reversing insulin resistance, a condition characterized by excessive insulin production. Starting slowly and gradually extending fasting periods is recommended, progressing from fewer meals to longer fasting windows, such as 16 hours fasting with an 8-hour eating window, then eventually transitioning to two meals a day with a 20-hour fasting period and a 4-hour eating window.

## What Is The Best Remedy For Cystic Acne

# What is the best remedy for cystic acne?

Two main causes of hormonal cystic acne:

1\. PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) This is a condition where you're making too much testosterone. High levels of insulin could potentially cause this condition.

2\. Too much 5-alpha reductase This is an enzyme that converts testosterone into a very powerful form of testosterone called DHT, which is causing acne. A natural 5-alpha reductase inhibitor may help. Natural 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are in cruciferous foods. There is also a concentrated form of cruciferous called DIM that may be beneficial as well.

## Can Onions Boost Testosterone Levels And Which Compounds Contribute To C51Db4

# Can onions boost testosterone levels, and which compounds contribute to this effect on hormone regulation?

Testosterone does a lot in the body, including increasing libido, controlling male characteristics, and increasing muscle growth. When someone takes testosterone, they inactivate the gland that makes the hormone. Generally, we want to choose natural ways to increase testosterone, which can involve natural glandular therapy. Onions are high in quercetin, which triggers the luteinizing hormone. Luteinizing hormone controls and can increase the production of testosterone in males.

**Onions also have a lot of additional health benefits:**

• They have powerful antioxidant effects

• They have properties that help with insulin resistance

• They have anti-cancer properties

• They can help increase nitric oxide to support the vascular system

• They may help reduce the risk of cataracts

• They may help reduce the risk of allergies

• They have potent anti-inflammatory properties

• They may help decrease blood pressure

• They can act as a diuretic

It’s best to consume raw onions to support healthy testosterone levels. However, you can sauté the onions or cook them—just be sure not to overcook them.

## What Common Mistakes Should Be Avoided When Dealing With Acne To Preve Bcd8Fa

# What common mistakes should be avoided when dealing with acne to prevent worsening the condition and promote clearer skin?

**The biggest mistake you can make when you're trying to get rid of your acne is trying to wash the acne off of your face.** Blackheads and acne are not dirt that you can simply wash off. When you use detergents, cleansers, alcohol wipes, antibacterial creams, you are literally destroying your microbiome on the surface of your skin.

Your skin contains millions of microbes that act as a barrier, which is involved in your immune system. When you remove that layer of good bacteria, you lose the bacterial diversity. In turn, this increases the inflammation on the skin—it can even cause acne.

This is also why one of the side effects of antibiotics is acne. Acne involves the sebaceous glands. These glands secrete an oil called sebum. Acne is essentially inflammation of these glands with excess amounts of sebum as well as pus and bacteria formation.

**Acne comes from high levels of androgens, which are hormones.** Your androgen levels spike when you're a teenager. In turn, this causes a problem with your sebaceous glands. What causes excess levels of androgens? Insulin. High levels of insulin can throw off your hormone balance. The cause of high insulin is a high-carb diet.

**If you cut the carbs out, the acne will go away. The healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting are the two best ways to promote healthy insulin levels. Try going keto, and let me know how that works for you in the comments below.**

## What Are The Physiological And Metabolic Benefits Associated With Lept 03C3Bc

# What are the physiological and metabolic benefits associated with leptin, and how does this hormone influence body weight regulation and energy balance?

Leptin is a hormone produced by fat cells. It sends signals through the blood to tell the body that you’re full. So leptin is a satiety hormone—it lets your brain know that it’s time to stop eating. If you have a hard time feeling full or satisfied, it could be that your leptin levels are too low.

Additionally, since your fat cells make leptin, the more body fat you have, the higher the levels of leptin that you should have. In theory, it would mean that the fatter you are, the more satisfied you should be. However, this is not the case. When you have an excessive amount of leptin, your leptin receptors begin to develop a resistance to it. This is very similar to insulin resistance. Those who are obese have a lot of leptin, but it is unavailable to their body. In turn, this condition brings a lot of hunger all day long.

The only way to restore leptin sensitivity is to lose weight so you can maintain a healthy leptin level.

## Have You Seen Any Data That Indicates Intermittent Fasting Increases T 9592Fe

# Have you seen any data that indicates intermittent fasting increases the risk of gut and liver cancer?

There is no evidence to suggest that intermittent fasting increases the risk of gut or liver cancer. In fact, throughout human evolution, periods of fasting were common, and our genes are well-adapted to this pattern. Intermittent fasting can help regulate insulin levels, unlike frequent eating, which can lead to constant insulin spikes. Humans, like animals in the wild, are not designed to graze continuously but to eat when genuinely hungry.

## What Factors Could Explain The Phenomenon Of Losing Hair On The Scalp  A6Fff3

# What factors could explain the phenomenon of losing hair on the scalp while experiencing increased facial hair growth?

**This symptom is related to a condition called, PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome).**

Insulin resistance causes high androgens and if you are sensitive to androgens, your hair could fall out. But insulin resistance is not associated with PCOS, it CAUSES PCOS. Insulin resistance causes a spike in insulin which converts to androgens and facial hair growth.

**The solution is to do intermittent fasting and healthy ketosis.**

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## Is There A Time Period That I Should Be Following Keto And Intermitten 97D6F3

# Is there a time period that I should be following Keto and Intermittent Fasting?

**The ketogenic diet is a lifelong commitment. Healthy keto with intermittent fasting will work while you do it, but the benefits will stop if you stop. You might see some awesome keto diet results, or intermittent fasting results and think it’s ok to stop. But, the long term effects of keto are so beneficial, you really don’t want to stop.**

The purpose of doing the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting is for so much more than just weight loss. Doing keto long term is a way of eating to minimize health problems.  You will eventually build up your health reserve, and you will be able to go off of the program here and there. But, there are no phases of the ketogenic diet. After you reach your keto weight loss goal, instead of adding in carbs, you can add in more calories and more fat.

There are multiple incredible benefits of healthy keto, ketosis, and intermittent fasting. Ketones are a more efficient fuel that your brain and heart prefer. But, one of the biggest problems out there right now is high insulin.

**Healthy keto with intermittent fasting will help you reduce your insulin, which will benefit your:**

• Heart

• Liver

• Brain

• Hormones

• Immune System

• Nerves

• Kidneys

• Eyes

## What Are Dr. Bergs Thoughts On Products That Are Full Of Ketones

# What are Dr. Berg's thoughts on products that are full of ketones?

There are products available that either convert to ketones, such as MCT oil, or contain exogenous ketones that can be consumed directly. These products range in price, with both premium and more affordable options on the market. While they may provide some benefits, particularly for individuals engaged in competitive exercise seeking additional energy, the overall enhancements in performance or well-being can be modest—primarily manifesting as improved mental clarity or energy.

In specific clinical scenarios, such as managing conditions like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, or dementia, the intake of ketone products can offer significant advantages. Ketones can serve as an alternative energy source for the brain, which may preferentially utilize ketones over glucose. This can be particularly beneficial for bypassing damaged neurons that struggle to metabolize glucose, thus potentially supporting cognitive function in affected individuals.

As with any supplement, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most suitable approach for your specific needs.

## Are My Ketone Levels Elevated Beyond A Safe Range

# Are my ketone levels elevated beyond a safe range?

Ketone levels become a concern when they reach 9 or 10 mmol/L, which is typically only seen in individuals with diabetes who may neglect their insulin regimen. For most individuals, normal ketone levels range from 0.5 to 3 mmol/L. Engaging in fasting can elevate ketone levels, often reaching around 4 mmol/L, while exercise can push levels to approximately 5 or 6 mmol/L. However, it is unlikely for levels to exceed this range in healthy individuals. If you have concerns about your ketone levels, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

## What Are The Key Techniques And Approaches For Stroke Recovery And Reh Ceb5F7

# What are the key techniques and approaches for stroke recovery and rehabilitation?

## **Understanding Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Techniques**

[Recovering from a stroke](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-to-do-after-a-stroke-important) is a complex process that requires a personalized approach. There's no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to stroke rehabilitation.

The most effective strategies involve a multifaceted approach that addresses both brain health and motor recovery. Let's explore some key techniques that can help optimize the stroke recovery process.

### **The Role of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Healing Brain Damage**

[Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-benefits-of-hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy) is a promising treatment for stroke recovery. It involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized chamber, which allows the lungs to gather more oxygen than possible at normal air pressure.

This increased oxygen supply can help heal damaged brain tissue by reducing inflammation, promoting new blood vessels' growth, and stimulating stem cell release.

While more research is needed, HBOT shows potential as a complementary therapy for stroke rehabilitation.

### **Ketones as an Alternative Fuel for Brain Recovery**

The brain typically relies on glucose for energy, but after a stroke, the brain's ability to use glucose may be impaired. This is where ketones come in.

[Ketones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-t-get-your-ketones-high-enough) are an alternative fuel source for the brain when glucose is unavailable. They can be obtained through a low-carb, high-fat diet, exogenous ketone supplements, [MCT oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-15-benefits-of-mct-or-medium-chain-triglyceride-oil), and intermittent fasting.

By providing the brain with an alternative energy source, ketones may help support brain function and recovery after a stroke.

## Can Keto Improve Borderline Hypothyroidism

# Can keto improve borderline hypothyroidism?

Adopting a ketogenic diet can significantly benefit your thyroid and overall endocrine system. High-carb diets increase insulin levels, leading to insulin resistance, which can severely impact the thyroid and other endocrine functions. Some people believe they can't follow a keto diet due to conditions like diabetes or Hashimoto's, but these are actually reasons to consider it. Keto can reduce inflammation, which is particularly beneficial for autoimmune thyroid disorders. Therefore, implementing a ketogenic diet may improve your situation.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## What Can I Do For Tyramine Intolerance On Keto

# What can I do for tyramine intolerance on keto?

Addressing tyramine intolerance on a keto diet requires careful dietary management. While a long-term keto lifestyle can improve conditions like autoimmune diseases or insulin resistance, it doesn't mean you can revert to previous eating habits that triggered these issues.

**Genetic Factors and Epigenetics**: Even with genetic predispositions, you have the power to influence your health through lifestyle choices. Epigenetics shows that your actions can modify gene expression, helping you control conditions previously thought to be unchangeable.

**Maintaining Progress**: It's essential to avoid foods that contribute to your intolerances and health issues. Your improved health is sustained by continuing to make smart, health-conscious choices, not by returning to problematic foods.

By adhering to a keto diet and focusing on suitable food choices, you can manage tyramine intolerance effectively and maintain your overall well-being.

## What Are The Most Effective Treatments To Reduce An Enlarged Prostate  6Dbeee

# What are the most effective treatments to reduce an enlarged prostate naturally?

**Symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia:**

• Frequent urination (especially at night)

• A weak stream

• Dribbling after urination

• A sensation that you can’t fully empty your bladder

Excess estrogen increases the size of the prostate. Estrogen also increases prolactin, which can increase the size of the prostate. Estrogen is a byproduct of testosterone in both females and males. To convert testosterone to estrogen, you need an enzyme called aromatase. The testicles and fat cells make aromatase.

Phytoestrogens can mimic estrogen, but not very much. To shrink the prostate naturally, we want to inhibit aromatase to decrease estrogen production.

**Top things that increase aromatase:**

• Age

• Body fat

• Insulin

• High-carb diets

• Alcohol

• Whole grains

• Hormone replacement therapy

• Birth control pills

**Things that decrease aromatase:**

• Cruciferous vegetables

• White button mushrooms (sautéed)

• Flaxseed

• Green tea

• Citrus peel

In addition to losing weight with Healthy Keto®, reducing insulin, and consuming cruciferous vegetables, you can try a fantastic natural remedy for an enlarged prostate that involves citrus peel.

**The best natural remedy to support prostate health:**

Add a whole lemon and a glass of water to a blender, and blend it for about 30 seconds.

Then, blend again with about five to ten drops of liquid stevia or 1/2 to 1 cup of blueberries. You can have this at any time of day—enjoy!

## What Happens When I Overeat

# What happens when I overeat?

Overeating can lead to increased stress on the digestive system, causing gas, bloating, nausea, and constipation. Regularly elevated insulin levels can result in insulin resistance (prediabetes) and an overworked pancreas. Poor digestion and excess food intake can also decrease sleep quality and cause the body to convert surplus food to body fat. The following day, you may experience increased cravings, moodiness, inflammation, and a slowed metabolism.

## Does Intermittent Fasting Increase Gallbladder Sludge

# Does intermittent fasting increase gallbladder sludge?

Intermittent fasting can lead to gallbladder sludge due to concentrated bile during periods of fasting, typically peaking around 10 to 15 hours after the last meal. Symptoms include right shoulder and abdominal pain, bloating, burping, and nausea. To mitigate these issues:

1\. Add lemon or apple cider vinegar to water during fasting to help thin bile.

2\. Gradually introduce fats in a ketogenic diet to avoid overwhelming the gallbladder.

3\. Keto and intermittent fasting can lower insulin levels, reducing the risk of gallstone formation typically associated with high insulin.

## Which Is Worse A High Carb Diet Or Snacking For Weight Loss

# Which is worse: a high carb diet or snacking for weight loss?

Snacking is actually worse than a high-carb diet when it comes to weight loss. Both increase insulin, but frequent snacking keeps insulin levels elevated throughout the day, preventing fat loss. For example, when I stopped snacking, even on seemingly healthy options like apples with peanut butter, I lost a significant amount of weight. Research has shown that snacking is a major contributor to obesity, more so than even high-carb diets.

Historically, people ate three meals a day with minimal snacking, and obesity rates were much lower. The modern habit of frequent snacking keeps insulin levels high, giving the pancreas no time to recover. This constant stimulation of insulin can be detrimental to your health.

Intermittent fasting is a powerful alternative that simplifies your eating routine and reduces hunger over time, making it an effective strategy for both weight loss and improving overall health.

## Can Drinking Water Help You Lose Weight

# Can drinking water help you lose weight?

**Water for Weight Loss**

• The water will replace calories from food that could cause you to eat less, and eating less causes to lose more weight.

• Reduced hunger – Let your body adapt to the burning of fat to make your hunger completely go away.

• Stimulates metabolism – This is NOT true. Lowering the dominating hormones (estrogen, insulin, and cortisol) that can nullify all 6 fat-burning hormones can stimulate the metabolism - also with exercise and good quality of sleep.

**Ways to Reduce Hunger:**

• Lower insulin – Insulin is the key hormone that makes you hungry. Reduce insulin by reducing carbs and decrease the frequency of eating.

• Lower estrogen.

• Lower cortisol.

• Exercise.

• Sleep.

## Should I Only Eat Egg Whites

# Should I only eat egg whites?

No, you should consume egg whites and egg yolks together. Eating only egg whites has a much greater effect on insulin.

## Whats Healthier Chicken Or Pork

# What's healthier chicken or pork?

Typically, commercial chicken and pork from a grocery store are highly processed. I never recommend consuming that type of meat.

**Problems with processed meat:**

• It’s factory farmed 

• The animals consume GMO grains 

• The animals are given antibiotics 

• The animals are given drugs that are arsenic-based 

• The animals are given formaldehyde 

Personally, I prefer pork because it’s fattier meat. If you have chicken with skin, the skin does provide some fattiness. Just remember that if you’re on the ketogenic diet, you want more fat in your diet. Lean meats stimulate insulin levels more than fatty meats. Pork would be better on your insulin levels.

## Is It Possible To Alleviate Migraines By Following A Ketogenic Diet

# Is it possible to alleviate migraines by following a ketogenic diet?

There are many things that can cause a migraine headache. But ketones can potentially help your brain in many ways.

A study in 1930 demonstrated that 28% of migraine sufferers reported having no migraines after being on keto. 25% of migraine sufferers reported less frequent migraines after being on keto.

Recent evidence suggests that migraines may stem from a cerebral energy deficiency. Part of the brain may not be getting energy. This could also relate to insulin resistance, which could be one reason why ketones may be effective. Ketones actually provide an alternative fuel to the brain.

The other factor that may contribute to a migraine is too much oxidative stress compared to how much antioxidant capacity you have. Ketones can act as an antioxidant.

Ketones may not only protect you from free-radical damage, but also they may act as an anti- inflammatory. Your brain loves ketones and actually prefers ketones over glucose.

**Potential benefits of ketones for the brain:**

- Can help improve your mood

- Can help improve your cognitive function (memory, focus and concentration)

- May help improve epilepsy

- Could help increase mitochondria function

- Can help reduce oxidative stress

If you have migraines, you may want to get on the ketogenic diet. It may also be beneficial to consume MCT oil and even exogenous ketones to help boost your ketones further.

**How to help supply the brain with ketones:**

- Do Healthy Keto®

- Eliminate snacks (do intermittent fasting)

## Can I Gain Weight From Antibiotics

# Can I gain weight from antibiotics?

Yes, antibiotics can contribute to weight gain. You have approximately 1,000 trillion microbes living in and on your body. When antibiotics eliminate beneficial bacteria, it can increase hunger, lead to cravings for unhealthy foods, and cause inflammation. This inflammation can then result in insulin resistance and subsequent weight gain.

## Can And Should I Use Stevia In My Diet

# Can and should I use stevia in my diet?

For the most part, if you can get stevia by itself, it’s going to be okay. Ideally, get the stevia that’s green and not white; the white has a lot of unneeded chemicals. It’s very important to read the labels on the things you buy. Just because something might be “keto-friendly” doesn’t mean it’s healthy. That can be the case with stevia on keto. The problems with some brands of stevia sweetener:

• Stevia in the Raw – contains maltodextrin (the sweetener highest on the glycemic index)

• Sweet Leaf – contains inulin (can create bloating)

• Better Stevia – contains organic cane alcohol

• Pyure Stevia – organic stevia and natural flavors (likely to be GMO ingredients)

## How Long Does It Take To Lose 50 Pounds On Keto

# How long does it take to lose 50 pounds on keto?

This depends on many factors. Some of them are:

- Metabolism

- Age

- Stress

- Discipline

- How healthy you have been

- Insulin resistance if you have it

- Any nutritional deficiencies if you have them

Everyone is different, and the results may depend on various things. On an average you would lose 2 lbs per day on a ketogenic diet. And this is an ideal scenario.

Make sure to follow the Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting plan to get the best results.

## I Ate When I Was Not Hungry While On Keto And Intermittent Fasting Is It Bad

# I ate when I was not hungry while on Keto and Intermittent fasting, is it bad?

Our body is not designed to eat at the frequency that people eat. You have social events, social events, birthdays, vacations, holidays, going out to dinner, etc.

**One of the best habits you can implement is:**

1\. Only eat when you are hungry

2\. Don't eat unless you are hungry.

If you are doing intermittent fasting and not hungry anymore, then do a gradient approach. The main point is keeping your nutrients high, but just eating less frequently. Eating spikes insulin.

## Do Medications Slow Down Results From Keto And Intermittent Fasting

# Do medications slow down results from Keto and Intermittent Fasting?

Metformin and Insulin will definitely slow the results because the goal is to lower insulin. Steroids are an injection for inflammation and skin problems can block your keto results. Anti-Depressants could slow the results and will give you side effects such as weight gain and statins worsen the results.

**Some Top Medications:**

- Metformin

- Insulin

- Steroids

- Anti-Depressants

- Statins

## Are High Ketones During Fasting Dangerous

# Are high ketones during fasting dangerous?

Ketoacidosis is a serious health concern that can have devastating health consequences. However, having ketones in the blood during a fast is rarely cause for alarm. In fact, it is often an indicator that your body is burning fat.

Ketoacidosis primarily happens to diabetics who don’t take the right amount of insulin. Ketoacidosis is very different from nutritional ketosis, which is beneficial and will result in ketone levels in the body being raised.
