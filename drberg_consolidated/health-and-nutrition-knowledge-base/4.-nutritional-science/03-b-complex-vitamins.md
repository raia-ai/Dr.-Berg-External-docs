## What Is The Best Supplement For Swollen Legs

# What is the best supplement for swollen legs?

Swollen legs, commonly associated with edema, are often attributed to liver, kidney, or heart issues. However, there's a chance you can address edema and pitting edema without resorting to blood thinners or diuretics.

The root of water retention in the lower legs lies in the sodium-potassium pumps within your cells. If these pumps malfunction, fluid builds up outside the cells, causing interstitial fluid retention.

High blood sugar can lead to swollen ankles due to glycation, a process that hampers the blood's ability to transport oxygen and nutrients. Glycated proteins also obstruct circulation, further contributing to swelling in the legs and ankles. Additionally, high blood sugar promotes sodium retention, which exacerbates water retention and can even result in peripheral neuropathy, causing numbness and tingling in the feet.

To combat edema, prioritize potassium intake, which is challenging to obtain solely through diet. Aim for 4700 mg daily, incorporating foods like avocados and berries. Magnesium is also vital; strive for 420 mg daily through sources like pumpkin seeds and leafy greens. A quality electrolyte powder without added sugars can supplement your intake.

Vitamin B1 deficiency is often linked to sodium-potassium pump issues, as it's essential for converting sugar into energy. Excessive refined carbohydrate consumption can deplete Vitamin B1 levels.

While Vitamin B1, potassium, and magnesium can significantly improve edema, eliminating sugar from your diet is crucial for long-term relief.

## Why Should I Choose Benfotiamine Over Allithiamine And Thiamine

# Why should I choose benfotiamine over allithiamine and thiamine?

**Why Choose Benfotiamine Over Allithiamine or Thiamine?** 

- **Choose Benfotiamine:** As a form of Vitamin B1, Benfotiamine supports the health and function of the nervous system. Its lipid-soluble nature allows it to be utilized effectively within nerve tissues, including penetrating the myelin sheath, which is crucial for normal nerve structure. It also contributes to normal cardiovascular function and energy production. 

- **Choose Allithiamine** As a naturally sourced form of Vitamin B1, Allithiamine contributes to meeting daily thiamine requirements. Adequate Vitamin B1 supports normal energy production, brain function, and the health of the nervous system. 

- **Choose Thiamine** if you need a basic, water-soluble form of Vitamin B1 for general supplementation. 

Ultimately, the choice depends on your specific health goals and needs. If you're unsure, consulting with a healthcare professional can help determine which form of Vitamin B1 is best for you.

# What is thiamine?

**Thiamine (Water-Soluble):** 

1. **Standard Form:** Thiamine is the standard water-soluble form of Vitamin B1, essential for meeting basic nutritional needs. However, due to its water-soluble nature, its absorption efficiency and ability to penetrate cell membranes may differ compared to lipid-soluble forms like Benfotiamine and Allithiamine, potentially resulting in differences in bioavailability

---

## What Is Allithiamine

# What is allithiamine?

**Allithiamine:** 

1. **Lipid-Soluble**: Like Benfotiamine, Allithiamine is also lipid-soluble, which enhances its absorption and bioavailability compared to water-soluble Thiamine. 

2. **Natural Source**: Allithiamine is derived from raw garlic and is known for its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, making it effective for supporting brain and nervous system health. 

3. **Supports Thiamine Status & Well-Being:** This form of Vitamin B1 helps ensure adequate thiamine levels, which is important because factors like diet and lifestyle can influence nutrient absorption and status. Thiamine contributes to normal energy production and supports overall nervous system health.

---

## What Is Benfotiamine

# What is Benfotiamine?

**Benfotiamine:** 

1. **Fat-Soluble**: Benfotiamine is a fat-soluble form of Vitamin B1, which allows it to be absorbed more efficiently and penetrate cells and tissues more effectively than water-soluble Thiamine. 

2. **Nerve Health Support:** This nutrient supports nerve health and helps maintain the normal structure and function of the myelin sheath (the insulation around nerve axons). It also supports the body's natural processes for managing advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and maintaining a healthy inflammatory response. This contributes to: 

1. Supporting overall nerve function and comfort. 

2. Promoting a healthy nervous system environment 

3. **Supports Thiamine-Dependent Pathways:** As a lipid-soluble form of Vitamin B1, Benfotiamine helps maintain healthy thiamine levels. Thiamine is crucial for normal carbohydrate metabolism and plays an important role in supporting healthy nerve tissue and cardiovascular function.

## What Is The Real Cause Of Tremors

# What is the real cause of tremors?

There is a high correlation between mitochondrial diseases and movement disorders. The nervous system requires a tremendous amount of energy, so it also requires very healthy mitochondria. When someone has a neurodegenerative disease, they usually have dysfunction in the mitochondria. Vitamin B2 and coenzyme Q10 are essential for FAD, which is vital for turning food into energy. Vitamin B2 also helps support the myelin sheath of your neurons. People who are deficient in vitamin B2 sometimes have neurodegenerative problems, neuropathologies, and swelling in the nervous system. Vitamin B2 acts as a precursor to help protect the mitochondria and help correct tremors. Coenzyme Q10 plays a similar role, helping to transport electrons from food so they can be converted into ATP, which provides cells with energy. If you take statins, you could become deficient in coenzyme Q10. This can cause all sorts of neurological and muscular symptoms, including tremors, which are a side effect of statins.

If you have tremors, consider taking 800 mg of B2 daily, split into two portions, 400 mg in the morning and 400 mg before bed. Also, try taking 1000 mg of coenzyme Q10—500 mg in the morning and 500 mg in the afternoon.

## What Is The Root Cause Of Peripheral Neuropathy

# What is the root cause of peripheral neuropathy?

Diabetic neuropathy usually affects the bottom of the feet and sometimes the hands and is one of the first signs of a blood sugar problem. Chemotherapy, hypothyroidism, autoimmune diseases, medications, viruses, and Lyme disease can also lead to peripheral neuropathy. However, high blood sugar and diabetes are the most common causes. Diabetes wears down the myelin sheath over time, leaving exposed nerves at the bottom of the feet. Peripheral neuropathy can feel like hypersensitivity, burning, severe pain, or itching. If it’s not corrected, it can lead to ulcers in the lower part of the body and gangrene.

Consuming too much sugar makes it difficult for the mitochondria to get enough fuel. Too much sugar also leads to nutrient deficiencies and inhibits the function of enzymes that bring fuel to the cell. When sugar blocks the body’s mechanism for getting energy to the cells, it utilizes alternative pathways for energy. One of these alternative pathways produces sorbitol, a sugar alcohol. Sorbitol can damage the lens of the eye, leading to cataracts. It can also affect the retina, leading to diabetic retinopathy. Sorbitol affects the cells that compose the myelin sheath. It can also convert to fructose, creating even more problems.

Benfotiamine is a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1 that can help support the nerves. Try taking 300 mg of benfotiamine 4 times daily. Lipoic acid is a cofactor for the enzyme that allows you to metabolize excess glucose. Vitamins B5, B2, and B3 are also cofactors for this enzyme. Diabetes damages your nervous system and brain over time, so it’s imperative to correct your diet, which I believe is the root cause of peripheral neuropathy. Learn more about the benefits of a low-carb diet and intermittent fasting in my other videos.

## What Foods Should I Be Eating If Im Over 50 Years Of Age

# What foods should I be eating if I'm over 50 years of age?

Dr. David Sinclair, an expert on longevity, has researched longevity genes called sirtuins. NAD can increase sirtuins! NAD is derived from niacin. It works inside your mitochondria, converting food to energy. As we age, our NAD decreases. Many people take supplements and get injections to boost NAD.

Dr. Abram Hoffer wrote a book about the diseases caused by too little niacin and how many diseases can be cured with mega doses. He’s one of the doctors who started the Orthomolecular Medicine Group, which used high doses of nutrients to create therapeutic dosages.

The following foods can increase NAD and should be part of a healthy diet for people over 50:

1\. Beef liver

2\. Grass-fed red meat

3\. Probiotic-rich foods—raw sauerkraut, yogurt

4\. Parsley (celery or chamomile tea can also work)

5\. Curcumin—turmeric

6\. Quercetin—onions

7\. Omega-3 fatty acids—wild-caught fatty fish, cod liver

Sulforaphane, found in cruciferous vegetables, is also beneficial for healthy aging. Broccoli sprouts and radish sprouts are great to add to salads! Anthocyanins, found in blue and purple foods like blueberries, blackberries, and purple cabbage, are also good for anti-aging.

## What Is The Number Food That Depletes Vitamins From The Body

# What is the number food that depletes vitamins from the body?

Refined starches include rice flour, tapioca flour, corn flour, modified corn starch, maltodextrin, and modified food starch. Certain nutrients are required to metabolize refined starch and turn it into energy. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) is vital to this process. Refined starches are much higher on the glycemic index (GI) than sugar—this scale tells you how fast a food can raise blood sugar. Sugar is a 74 on the GI, while refined starches like maltodextrin are 180! Vitamin B1 is not stored in the body in large amounts, so consuming refined starches can quickly cause you to become deficient.

**Symptoms of vitamin B1 deficiency include:**

•Fatigue

•GI problems (slow digestion, bloating, constipation, nausea)

•Low stomach acid

•Low bile

•Stress

•Nervous tension

•Insomnia

•Frequent mood swings

•Muscle twitches

•Breathing problems

Much of the refined starch broken down into glucose in the body can not be used as energy, so it’s converted into lactic acid. This decreases oxygen in the body and makes it more acidic, which can cause hyperventilation and restless legs syndrome.

## What Is The 30 Day Sugar Detox Program And How Does It Help Reduce Sug 70A1B2

# What is the 30-Day Sugar Detox program, and how does it help reduce sugar intake and improve health?

What will happen if you cut sugar out of your diet for thirty days? Let’s talk about it.

Metabolic flexibility is a term used to describe how smoothly and efficiently your cells can adapt to utilize and burn fuel like fat, ketones, or glucose.

When you’re metabolically inflexible, this transition is very dysfunctional. Your ability to burn fat in a fasting state will be very difficult. If you can’t lose weight when fasting or exercising, this could be why.

Metabolic inflexibility can lead to diabetes, obesity, loss of muscle protein, and chronic illnesses. It can also cause irritability, fatigue, anxiety, and hunger. When you try to fast, you won’t feel very good, and you’ll miss out on certain benefits if you’re not metabolically flexible.

Insulin resistance is at the heart of this problem. Insulin controls whether you burn fat or not. If someone is metabolically inflexible, they have insulin resistance. Insulin tells the body not to burn fat and to store fat instead.

On the flip side, metabolic flexibility is really insulin sensitivity, and there are ways to make the body more metabolically flexible or insulin sensitive.

When you become more metabolically flexible, you’ll be able to fast for longer without hunger or cravings, burn fat, and burn sugar more efficiently.

How to transition your body into a state of metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity:

1\. Eat less frequently

2\. Eat fewer carbohydrates

3\. Eat sufficient amounts of fat, but not excessive amounts of fat

4\. Try exercise snacking (do short bouts of exercise throughout the day)

## What Is The Significant Role Of Lutein In Supporting And Enhancing Bot 21B36E

# What is the significant role of lutein in supporting and enhancing both eye and brain health, and how does it contribute to overall cognitive and visual function?

Lutein is a powerful carotenoid that supports both eye and brain health. Found in many fruits and vegetables, it helps combat oxidative stress and harmful light.

**Protecting Retinal Health**

Lutein accumulates in the macula, enhancing macular pigment optical density (MPOD), which filters out damaging blue light. This helps prevent age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss. Higher MPOD is linked to better visual acuity and contrast sensitivity.

**Boosting Cognitive Abilities**

Lutein also benefits the brain, particularly in regions linked to memory and learning. Higher dietary lutein levels are associated with improved cognitive function and reduced risk of age-related cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease. Its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties may protect brain cells and support optimal brain function.

**Understanding Gout and Potential Natural Treatments**

Gout is caused by a buildup of uric acid in the body, leading to painful inflammation in joints. Traditional gout medications target the xanthine oxidase enzyme, which is responsible for producing uric acid.

While dietary changes (reducing alcohol and fructose intake) are important, they may not always be sufficient to prevent gout attacks. Researchers are exploring natural substances that might help manage gout.

Sulforaphane, found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and radish sprouts, shows promise in this area. It has a high bioavailability, meaning your body can easily absorb and use it.

**How Sulforaphane Could Help with Gout**

- **Enhancing Detoxification:** Sulforaphane may activate genes and enzymes that support the body's natural detoxification processes, potentially helping to eliminate excess uric acid.

- **Improving Kidney Function:** Some research suggests sulforaphane might promote kidney health. Healthy kidneys are essential for filtering uric acid from the body.

- **Reducing Inflammation:** Sulforaphane has antioxidant properties, which could help reduce inflammation associated with gout attacks.

- **Gut Health Support:** Sulforaphane might promote a healthy gut microbiome, indirectly supporting uric acid management.

**Important Note:** While sulforaphane offers potential benefits, it's crucial to consult your doctor before using it as a gout treatment. It's essential to get a proper diagnosis and discuss whether natural remedies are right for your specific case.

## How To Safely Extending A Fasting Window   Intermittent Fasting   Prol 6F5845

# How to Safely Extending a Fasting Window - Intermittent Fasting - Prolonged Fasting

To safely extend intermittent fasting into prolonged fasting, follow a gradual and well-planned approach to allow your body to adapt to more extended periods without food. Here are some guidelines for prolonging a fasting window: 

1. Extend your intermittent fast from a 20:4 fasting and feeding window to a 22:2 or an OMAD intermittent fast. Pay attention to how your body responds. If you experience fatigue, a lowering of mood, or anxiety, these could be signs that you’re advancing too quickly.  Once you have safely completed OMAD, return to a 20:4 or 22:2 fasting pattern for a day or two before you attempt your following OMAD intermittent fasting pattern.  Once you have established a regular pattern of OMAD fasting, it is a good idea to have a weekly feeding day, with an extended feeding window with three meals, to ensure you build up your nutrient reserves for the following OMAD schedule. 

2. Before attempting a 36- or 48-hour fast, it's crucial to establish a consistent OMAD eating pattern and a solid nutritional foundation. Always consult your doctor, especially if you have any health concerns. During extended fasts, follow the safety guidelines listed above. 

3. A 72-hour fast or longer must be performed with a healthcare provider, as the longer the fast, the longer the recovery period between prolonged fasts.  As a general guideline, for every *day* of a prolonged fast, you should recover and rebuild your nutrient reserves for at least the same number of *weeks* before your next prolonged fast.  For example, a 3-day fast (72 hours) should be followed by three weeks of recovery before attempting another 3-day fast.  This general guideline should be followed only after consulting your healthcare provider before your next prolonged fast.

## How To Break Your Prolonged Fast

# How to Break Your Prolonged Fast

Breaking a prolonged fast safely is crucial to avoid potential health issues such as refeeding syndrome.  This severe and potentially fatal medical condition happens when you start to increase your calorie intake after a prolonged fast. The reintroduction of carbohydrates triggers a shift from fat to carbohydrate metabolism, leading to severe electrolyte imbalances and fluid alterations. These imbalances can cause complications such as heart failure, seizures, and, in extreme cases, death. A crucial factor contributing to refeeding syndrome is nutrient deficiency, particularly phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium, which are rapidly depleted as they are used in metabolizing glucose upon resuming eating. This condition underscores the importance of carefully planning and executing the transition from fasting to a typical eating pattern to avoid such risks. 

Please review “[The #1 Danger of Prolonged Fasting You HAVE to Know About](https://youtu.be/ldi9vElgemE?si=Vvq1e-m8sgxxv15J)” to learn more about refeeding syndrome, its risks, and ways to help avoid it. 

Here are the steps to safely break a prolonged fast, based on Dr. Berg's advice: 

1. **Start Slowly**: Begin by consuming small amounts of food. It's important not to overwhelm your digestive system, which has been resting during the fast. 

2. **Supplement with Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)**: Essential for glucose metabolism and helps convert food into energy. It is particularly crucial during refeeding to help prevent refeeding syndrome. 

3. **Avoid High-Carbohydrate Foods**: Avoid foods high in carbohydrates immediately after a fast. They can rapidly deplete minerals like potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and B1, increasing the risk of refeeding syndrome. 

4. **Choose the Right Foods**: 

1. **Keto-Friendly Foods**: [Keto-friendly foods](https://www.drberg.com/ketosis-approved-foods) help maintain stable blood sugar levels and prevent sudden depletion of essential minerals. 

2. **Easy-to-Digest Foods**: Foods like soups, smoothies, or bone broth are recommended as they are gentle on the stomach and more easily digested. 

3. **Gradual Increase**: Gradually increase the quantity and variety of foods over several days. This allows your body to adapt without causing undue stress on your metabolic system. 

4. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay close attention to how your body reacts during refeeding. If you experience any adverse symptoms, you may need to adjust and consume less food and/or space out your intake of nutrients. 

These steps can help reintroduce food to support your body’s needs and minimize potential risks. Consult a healthcare professional before starting or ending a prolonged fast, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions.

## What Is A Prolonged Fasting

# What is a Prolonged Fasting?

Prolonged fasting refers to not eating food for extended periods, typically 48 to 72 hours or longer.  Depending on individual goals and health conditions, it may extend to a week or more.   

Fasting to prolonged fasting can be thought of similarly to walking and running.  Fasting from your last meal of the day, overnight to the first meal of the next, is something we all do without much thought.  Walking and running are things an able-bodied person can typically do without much thought.   

Intermittent fasting is more like walking or running for regular exercise.  There is more thought into when and how long you will perform the exercise, and specific goals are made around it.  OMAD is like a 20 km or 12.4-mile walk or run.  While a 20 km walk or run and OMAD intermittent fasting are challenging, they are doable for many who have planned, prepared and practiced shorter distances or fasting durations.   

Prolonged fasting is comparable to marathon walking or running.  Proper planning, preparation, practice, health monitoring, and recovery are essential to fasting and a marathon.  If a marathon (26.2 miles or 42.2 km) seems daunting, you should think similarly of a 48- to 72-hour prolonged fast.  Longer prolonged fasts should be viewed as entering an ultramarathon. The longer you go, the more preparation, planning, practice, health monitoring, and recovery are needed.

## What Is The Distinction Between Folate And Folic Acid Particularly In  155216

# What is the distinction between folate and folic acid, particularly in terms of their forms, sources, and how the body absorbs and utilizes each?

**Folate vs. Folic Acid: What's the Difference?**

- **Folic acid:** A synthetic form of vitamin B9 often added to supplements and fortified foods.

- **Folate:** The natural form of vitamin B9 found in whole foods.

**The Problem with Folic Acid**

Many people have a genetic variation that makes it difficult for their bodies to convert folic acid into the usable form of vitamin B9. This can lead to health concerns if too much unconverted folic acid builds up.

**The Solution: Methylfolate**

Methylfolate is a readily usable form of vitamin B9 that bypasses the need for conversion. This makes it a safer and more effective choice, especially for those with genetic variation.

**Key Takeaways**

- **Opt for Methylfolate:** Choose supplements with methylfolate instead of folic acid.

- **Focus on Food:** Get natural folate from leafy greens and other whole foods.

## What Is Betaine Hcl And What Are Its Benefits For Digestive Health And 84Badb

# What is Betaine HCL, and what are its benefits for digestive health and overall well-being?

**Betaine hydrochloride is an amino acid.** It’s found naturally in certain foods including beets, spinach, beef, and shrimp. Betaine hydrochloride is an important natural remedy if you have SIBO (small intestine bacterial overgrowth), because one of the functions of a strong acid is to prevent pathogens from moving from the stomach into your small intestine then multiplying out of control. **Betaine hydrochloride is meant to increase your stomach acid; in other words, to lower your pH.** Your stomach acid should be between 1.5 and 3, which is highly acidic. This will help with the absorption of vitamin B12, minerals, trace minerals, and protein. It activates protease, an enzyme that helps break down protein into amino acids. If your body can’t properly break down protein, it’s left partially undigested, which creates a big problem.

**The remedy of betaine hydrochloride is excellent for GERD and acid reflux.** **Be sure to not take calcium at the same time as betaine hydrochloride, because the calcium will neutralize the acid. I recommend taking betaine hydrochloride before each meal. You may need as much as 5 or 6 tablets before you start eating. It may take some time for it to help your body make more acid. Antibiotics and antacids tend to destroy your stomach acid, making you more dependent on these medications. Take betaine hydrochloride to help.**

## What Is Glutathione And How Can I Make Sure I Get Enough Amount Of It  Ea88C9

# What is glutathione and how can I make sure I get enough amount of it without taking supplements?

**Glutathione is an important antioxidant present in all of your cells. It helps detoxify heavy metals and protects against free radical damage and oxidation. Your body makes glutathione! You should only take a supplement if you have Tylenol poisoning. Tylenol depletes glutathione and puts your liver at risk for damage. If you’re dealing with Tylenol poisoning, you may be given an NAC supplement, a precursor to help build up your glutathione.**

**Try the following tips to ensure that you’re getting enough glutathione without taking a supplement:**

1\. Get enough glycine. Consume organ meats, the skin from meat and fish, bone broth, and gelatin.

2\. Ensure adequate B vitamin intake. Avoid synthetic B vitamins. Meat is a great source of B12 and consuming organ meats and dark leafy greens will help add folate to your diet.

3\. Get plenty of vitamin C from sources like sauerkraut and leafy greens.

4\. Get enough sleep.

5\. Do not over-exercise. Limit high-intensity exercise to twice a week.

6\. Reduce stress. Adaptogens, going for a walk, listening to music, and even physical labor can reduce stress.

7\. Consume sufficient protein with plenty of calories.

8\. Increase carb intake to 50 grams per day.

9\. Consume cruciferous vegetables.

10\. Consume seafood for trace minerals like zinc and selenium.

## Which Vitamin Is Most Effective For Promoting Healthy Skin And How Doe A8E9C4

# Which vitamin is most effective for promoting healthy skin, and how does it contribute to skin health and appearance?

**If you are deficient in vitamin B3, you can end up with pellagra. However, there’s also a subclinical version of this B3 deficiency. This is a situation where you have dermatitis—dry, brittle, scaly, and red skin.**

**Vitamin B3 helps protect and restore your DNA, which results in your skin feeling and looking vibrant and healthy.**

Studies show that those with pellagra see amazing results when taking vitamin B3. Those with pellagra often consume too much corn, flour, rice, and alcohol. To fix this problem, people started adding synthetic vitamin B3 to enhance these foods. The problem is, synthetic vitamins don’t have the same effects as natural ones.

**A healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting eliminate this problem. You should know that the best form of vitamin B3 is niacinamide.**

**Vitamin B3 can also help with:**

• Brown spots

• Skin cancer

• Anti-aging

• Decreased acne

## What Is The Quickest Method To Alleviate Stress And Achieve Immediate  9E4Cf6

# What is the quickest method to alleviate stress and achieve immediate relaxation?

Certain stressors on the body, like exercise, heat therapy, or cold therapy, are in your control and have positive effects on the body. But, negative stress is out of your control and can have harmful effects. This lack of control could be related to a situation, condition, or relationship.

**In a stress state, you have a lot of involuntary glandular secretions and reactions occurring. Two parts of the body have both involuntary and voluntary control: the diaphragm and skeletal muscles.**

Controlled breathing exercises and walking are powerful to put yourself back in control of these systems and pull yourself out of a reactive fight or flight mode.

It’s also important to understand that a vitamin B1 deficiency can mimic mild hypoxia and trigger your stress reflexes. Vitamin B1 is crucial to help pull yourself out of a stress state and even prevent stress.

**Overall, the best things when dealing with stress are:**

1\. Controlled breathing exercises

2\. Walks

3\. Vitamin B1

## Im Experiencing A Hair Loss On Frequent Fasting What Can I Do

# I'm experiencing a hair loss on frequent fasting, what can I do?

Hair loss during frequent or prolonged fasting can sometimes be caused by a lack of essential nutrients. Before starting a fast, it's important to build strong nutritional reserves, just like building muscle for exercise. To ease into fasting, start with a healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting with three meals a day. As your body adjusts, gradually skip meals until you reach one meal a day. Extend fasts slowly and carefully. The key is to listen to your body and progress at a comfortable pace.

**Supplement:**

- **Amino Acids (Dr. Minkoff Brand)**\-For healthy hair growth, your body relies on a steady supply of protein's building blocks, called amino acids. Diets lacking sufficient protein can disrupt this process and lead to hair growth problems.

- **Trace Minerals** -While a wide range of trace minerals impact hair health, iron, zinc, copper, silicon, and selenium play particularly vital roles in supporting hair follicle function and hair growth.

- **B-Vitamins** - are essential for hair growth because they support two key factors: healthy cell replication (which hair follicles rely on for rapid growth) and strong blood circulation to the scalp (which delivers vital nutrients to the hair follicles).

- **Whole Food Multivitamin** -Gives your body the nutrient reserves it needs to help prevent hair loss during periodic and prolonged fasting.

## What Are The Key Benefits Of Vitamin B12 For Overall Health Including  276201

# What are the key benefits of Vitamin B12 for overall health, including its role in energy production, neurological function, and red blood cell formation?

Vitamin B12 is an essential B vitamin that you have to get from your diet. Vitamin B12 basically makes the foundation of red blood cells, white blood cells and myelin. Myelin is the outer covering of your nervous system. When you lose myelin, you can get all sorts of electrical problems, pain problems, and nerve problems.

Taking potassium for a long period of time could deplete B12, especially if you aren’t consuming enough B12 in your diet. If you increase B12 by taking it as a supplement, you can decrease your potassium reserves.

**Benefits**

- Involved in production of red blood cells

- Involved in production of white blood cells

- Involved in brain functions / nerve functions

- Involved in creation of DNA

- Supports your nervous system by helping to produce myelin

**Symptoms of deficiency**

- Fatigue

- Paleness

- Memory problems

- Neurological issues

- Anemia

- Depression

- Paranoia

- Delusions

- Dementia

- Pins/needles and numbness in the body

- Swollen tongue

- Tremors

- Diarrhea

- Nausea

- Upset stomach

- Rash

- Headaches

- Dizziness

- Joint pain

**Causes of deficiency**

Most vitamin B12 deficiencies are not caused by a lack of vitamin B12 in the diet, but rather a lack of absorption because the stomach is not acidic enough. A lot of people have a problem with the pH of the stomach.

Here are the main causes of B12 deficiency:

- Low stomach acid

- Acid reflux

- GERD

- Gas

- Bloating

- Atrophic gastritis (take Zypan to treat it)

- Past stomach surgery

- Metformin

- Vegan (although vegans can get B12 from wheatgrass juice powder)

**Synthetic and natural version of vitamin B12**

The synthetic version of vitamin B12 is called cyanocobalamin. The natural version of vitamin B12 is called methylcobalamin.

The main reason why people get synthetic vitamin B12 is that it’s cheaper. In many cases, on the label of synthetic vitamin B12, it will say something like 5000%. But more is not always better. The reason why it’s 5000% is that it takes so much of it to be absorbed.

**How to consume it**

Add vitamin B12-rich foods to your diet. If you consume it in a supplement form, follow the directions on the label for the proper dosage.

If you are deficient in vitamin B12, apple cider vinegar may help with this situation. You could try adding apple cider vinegar in some water and drink it. You may not even need to take more B12 because doing this to acidify your stomach could help with the absorption of the B12 in your diet. Sea salt, potassium, and iodine could also help build up your stomach acid and help with absorption.

It’s recommended that you consume 1000 mcg to 3000 mcg of methylcobalamin (B12) daily to counter B12 deficiency symptoms.

Cyanocobalamin (synthetic B12):

- Not easily absorbed

- Splits off into cyanide

Methylcobalamin (natural B12):

- Bonds to protein (needs stomach acid to break it down)

- Most animal products are filled with it

**Where to get it**

- You can get it from a methylcobalamin supplement. Or from food sources. Here is the list of B12-rich foods:

- Animal liver and kidney

- Clams

- Sardines

- Beef

- Tuna

- Nutritional yeast

- Trout

- Salmon

- Fortified non-dairy milk

- Dairy

- Eggs

If you are vegan, there are 3 primary sources of B12:

- Chlorella (best vegan source)

- Nori (red algae) • Spirulina

## What Is Anxiety And How Does It Manifest In Terms Of Emotional Psychol Be5Af5

# What is anxiety, and how does it manifest in terms of emotional, psychological, and physical symptoms?

**Anxiety is defined as worrying about something that may or may not happen. It can be triggered by speculation, sensationalism, or conjecture.**

Speculation is when we are concerned about things not based on facts or knowledge, while sensationalism is the use of shocking words or exaggerated stories to grab attention. A conjecture, on the other hand, is an opinion based on guessing rather than the truth.

**These triggers can cause anxiety that, if left unchecked, may become chronic and affect our adrenal glands. This, in turn, encourages the release of adrenaline and cortisol, weakening our immune system and accelerating the aging process.**

Limiting exposure to stress through activities such as exercise and spending time in nature is essential to break this cycle. It’s also best to avoid negative messages and sensationalized news that provoke these anxious thoughts.

Additionally, incorporating adaptogens into our diet, such as vitamin B1 and ashwagandha, helps to strengthen our ability to cope with daily stress.

## How Can I Prevent Cramping And Nail Splitting During Prolonged Fasts

# How can I prevent cramping and nail splitting during prolonged fasts?

Biotin would help. That usually comes from the gut. It's in the category of B vitamins, but also silicon also is good for nail cracking. But I would look at both of those being a problem, especially if you're doing fasting, you're probably going to add some supplement to that.

## What Is Vitamin F And What Are Its Roles And Benefits Within Human Hea F43E64

# What is Vitamin F, and what are its roles and benefits within human health and nutrition?

Vitamin F is no longer considered a vitamin because it doesn’t fit the traditional definition of
a vitamin. Vitamin F is the combination of two essential fatty acids. Essential fatty acids are fats that must come from your diet—your body can’t make them. Vitamin F is ALA (alpha-linoleic acid), an omega-3 fatty acid, and LA (linoleic acid), an omega-6 fatty acid.

Every single organ in your body needs these two essential fatty acids. They help you absorb calcium, build cell structures, maintain cell flexibility and grow cells.

**Benefits:**

- May reduce the risk of heart diseases

- May reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes

- May improve blood sugar control

- Reduces inflammation

- Supports heart health

- Aids growth and development

- Supports mental health

**Symptoms of deficiency**

- Dry, flaky skin ( to handle it - begin to restore a healthy ratio of omega-6 to omega-3)

- Prostate enlargement

- Inflammation

- Vision problems

- Heart problems

- Brain problems

**How to consume it**

Include vitamin F-rich foods in your diet. If you consume it in a supplement form, follow the directions on the label for the proper dosage.

**Where to get it**

The best sources of vitamin F / omega-3 fatty acids are:

- Vitamin F supplement

- Avocados

- Greens

- Almonds

- Walnuts

- Sprouts

- Chia

- Sunflower seeds

- Olive oil

- Fish (especially fatty fish)

- Eggs

## What Is The Most Critical Supplement For Supporting Optimal Health In  D29685

# What is the most critical supplement for supporting optimal health in individuals managing diabetes?

Benfotiamine is a synthetic B1. Vitamin B1 is naturally water-soluble. Benfotiamine is a fat-soluble B1 vitamin. This is one of the only synthetic vitamins that I like because it has virtually no side-effects.

I believe every diabetic should be taking benfotiamine. Vitamin B1 is involved in the engine in the mitochondria that involves glucose metabolism. The more glucose you have running through the machine, the higher the blood sugar, and the more depleted of vitamin B1 you’re going to become.

With diabetes, there are four main tissues involved, and B1 can help with all of them:

1\. Nerves/brain - Neuropathy 

2\. Eyes - Retina

3\. Kidney - Nephron

4\. Heart vessels - Microvascular endothelial dysfunction

Benfotiamine:

• 3-5x more absorption

• Protects against oxidation and AGEs

• Decreases A1C

• Protection

When it comes to benfotiamine dosage, consider taking at least 600mg of benfotiamine per day, and you can spread it out. You should also be doing healthy keto and intermittent fasting. 

***We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.***

## What Are The Common Symptoms Associated With A Skin Rash And How Can T 7Fd779

# What are the common symptoms associated with a skin rash, and how can these symptoms vary based on the underlying cause?

When you have poor blood clotting or nutrient deficiencies you may have red, pink or purple spots on your skin that can also itch. What is important to know is that for healthy functioning of the skin we need several vitamins. Let’s look at the known remedies for this condition.

**Cause #1: Bile deficiency**

Bile is a very important liquid that is produced in your liver and stored in your gallbladder. The main function of bile is digestion of fats as well as certain vitamins. Additionally, If you consume too much fat and are unable to digest it, this can cause skin rash. In such a case purified bile salts can help you digest fats.

**Cause #2: Vitamin B2 deficiency**

Vitamin B2 is very important for healthy levels of the skin as well as for proper digestion of fats. The more fat you eat, the more B2 you need. Lack of B2 in the body can cause skin rash.

**Cause #3: Allergies**

Allergy means intolerance to certain types of foods or environmental elements, like pollen. Your body overreacts to the thing causing allergy (allergen), creating a lot of symptoms like inflammation, irritation, etc. The best way to see if you have an allergy is to look back and see what you ate or were exposed to just before getting a rash. Chances are that there was an unusual type of food or an environmental substance you were exposed to.

**Detoxification:**

Additionally, while on keto and intermittent fasting, your body may go through a detoxification cycle. This is because you are burning and breaking down your body fat, which releases toxins that were stored in the fatty tissue. Therefore, fat-burning can cause this reaction.

## What Interventions Are Effective In Alleviating Sleep Disturbances Ass A86967

# What interventions are effective in alleviating sleep disturbances associated with elevated cortisol levels?

What is cortisol? Cortisol is a stress hormone that has a lot of different functions with the immune system for countering stress. It’s a survival hormone. 

\*High cortisol can definitely interfere with restful sleep. 

Between about 12am and 2am, you should have the lowest amount of cortisol. The highest level of cortisol is between 6am and 9 am. But, in some cases, cortisol can get higher during the night and counter deep sleep. You might be sleeping, but you’re not getting deep sleep or restful sleep. 

There can be a problem with different parts of the brain that are activated and then prevent you from getting restful sleep, all because your cortisol will not turn off. The goal is not to keep cortisol at zero but to help normalize cortisol, so you don’t have anything interfering with your sleep cycles. But, you still need to have the function of cortisol, which is vital. 

**What to do about high cortisol:**

• Figure out what’s causing you stress and do what you can to handle it 

• Go for long walks (45-60 minutes every day outside and disconnected) 

• Try my do it yourself acupressure technique 

**What you can take to reduce stress:**

• L-tyrosine

• L-theanine 

• Calcium

• Magnesium 

• Potassium

• Zinc 

• GABA

• Ashwagandha 

• Magnolia 

• NAC

• Vitamin C

• Vitamin B1

## What Approaches Should Be Considered For Managing Attention Deficit Hy D47923

# What approaches should be considered for managing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?

First, I want to start off by saying that ADHD is not genetic—there’s no evidence that says it is. In fact, it’s also not a Ritalin deficiency. From my viewpoint, it’s not even a mental disease—it’s purely a nutritional deficiency.

**Symptoms of ADHD include:**

• Inability to focus/pay attention

• Hyperactivity

• Restlessness

• Visual learning problems

• Difficulty reading

• Poor memory

A 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial showed significant improvements in the behavior of children with ADHD when given high doses of EPA and DHA (750mg) daily. If you have ADHD, (EPA and DHA) can help. You especially want to take EPA.

EPA and DHA are omega-3 fatty acids. You have omega-3s, and you have omega-6s. Your body cannot make these—you have to get them from your diet.

The problem is, you need more omega-3s and less omega-6s. Omega-3s are far more important. However, the average person consumes 16x more omega-6s. Omega-3s have antipsychotic properties, improve your cognition, and boost your IQ. They also help with brain development. Omega-3s can improve levels of dopamine and serotonin. They have neuron-protecting powers.

Vitamin B1 can also help your child with restlessness and hyperactivity. Nutritional yeast is a great source of B vitamins. You can try taking 750 mg of omega-3s EPA/DHA, reduce your intake of omega-6s, and increase vitamin B1 for ADHD.

## What Is Angular Cheilitis And What Are The Various Factors And Underly 0Ca733

# What is angular cheilitis, and what are the various factors and underlying conditions that can lead to its development?

Angular cheilitis is a condition where the corners of your mouth become dry, cracked, and inflamed. This condition can last for only a few days, or it can last years. It has a simple cause that can be easily fixed with diet.

**Cause #1: Lack of vitamin B2**

Cracked corners in your mouth are caused by low levels of vitamin B2. Consuming too many refined grains and some other products will deplete your body of this vitamin.

## Are There Any Danger Sides Of Fasting

# Are there any danger sides of fasting?

[Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do *not* encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provide this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast.  If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

Most of the dangers of fasting I’m going to cover aren’t related to a 16 to 18-hour fast. This applies more to prolonged fasting, which is when a person fasts for 48 to 72 hours—or even longer. The purpose of eating is not just to get fuel. It’s also to get nutrients. When you’re fasting, you’re restricting nutrients. If your diet isn’t providing you with the nutrients you need when you do eat, you could end up with deficiencies that lead to certain issues.
**It’s crucial to do a prolonged fast correctly and avoid common mistakes related to the dark side of fasting.**

**The dark side of prolonged fasting:**

1\. Refeeding syndrome When you come off of a fast, have a small amount of food, wait a couple of hours, and have a little bit more. Avoid overeating or eating carbs.

2\. Dirty keto Make sure you consume nutrient-dense, high-quality foods on the keto diet.

3\. Not taking nutrients while fasting At the bare minimum, you need to take electrolytes, sea salt, trace minerals, and B vitamins while fasting.

4\. Kidney stones Avoid high-oxalate foods if you’re prone to kidney stones. Also, consume at least two and a half liters of fluid a day, and add lemon juice to your water. When you’re back to having meals, consume large salads.

5\. Anorexia Anorexia will cause nutritional deficiencies. Instead of fasting, get on the keto diet.

6\. Athletes that have not adapted to fat yet Give your body enough time to become fully fat-adapted before attempting prolonged fasting.

7\. Fasting for children Fasting isn’t a good idea for children. Eating three meals a day and cutting out snacking may be beneficial for children. Teenagers who are overweight may consider two meals a day without snacking.

8\. Not getting enough nutrition while pregnant or lactating Not getting enough nutrients while pregnant or lactating can lead to issues for the mother and child. Choosing a whole-food, natural prenatal vitamin over a synthetic prenatal vitamin is also important.

9\. Muscle loss If you’re older and noticing muscle loss, try adding a blend of amino acids to your diet.

10\. Ketoacidosis This rare condition occurs in people under very specific circumstances and isn't something most people should be concerned about.

## What Therapeutic Approaches And Interventions Can Be Utilized To Allev 7B06D1

# What therapeutic approaches and interventions can be utilized to alleviate pain associated with peripheral neuropathy?

**Peripheral neuropathy is a pain, burning pain, numbness, tingling, and numbness in your feet and hands.**

1) These are caused by the high level of sugar in the blood causing microvascular. The body does not like too much sugar, and it becomes toxic.

2) Glycation end products protein that builds up because of the sugar.

3) Deficiencies in Vitamin B12 and B1, which causes short-circuiting of the electric flow and start getting nerve issues. The solution is to fix the insulin problem and start taking vitamins B12, and B1 in fat-soluble form and nutritional yeast which you can get from your nutritional store.

## How Does A Person Start Binge Eating

# How does a person start binge eating?

When you consume carbs, it affects your blood sugar levels. Your blood sugar will end up at a lower state about 30-40 minutes after eating the carbs. This will then increase your cortisol levels and cause you to feel more stressed.

Dopamine (a pleasure hormone) is actually increased with the anticipation of a reward like cookies or ice cream, but not when you’re consuming it. Dopamine doesn’t actually lower cortisol, and your cortisol will be increased after consuming carbs. Medication or alcohol may block stress for longer, but it will come back.

**A few powerful things you can do for stress:**

1\. Take vitamin B1 or nutritional yeast (without synthetic vitamins)

2\. Take magnesium

3\. Drink lemon balm tea

4\. Take L-theanine

5\. Take an adaptogen like ashwagandha

## What Is Adhd And How Can It Be Viewed As A Nutritional Issue Rather Th E2A7B6

# What is ADHD, and how can it be viewed as a nutritional issue rather than solely a mental health condition?

A child with ADHD is described as having trouble getting started on tasks, getting dressed, putting away toys—the child ignores directions or delays in following directions, has a hard time sitting during meals, fidgets or talks when they are expected to be quiet, has trouble stopping one activity to begin another, struggles to slow down enough to do things carefully, needs to be reminded a lot to stop and listen, has a hard time paying attention, grabs things without permission, is unable to wait for directions, takes too much time to complete tasks, has trouble remembering directions, has trouble recalling facts they just learned, and gets very upset or annoyed over minor frustrations.

These are all normal behaviors for a second-grader. And yet, they are labeled as ADHD and put on drugs.

Instead of giving kids prescription drugs for normal behaviors, you should support a child’s healthy behaviors naturally with nutrients.

**These nutrients can help promote calmness and focus:**

• Vitamin B1

• Potassium

• Magnesium

**Avoid:**

• Sugar

• Preservatives

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## What Are The Underlying Factors That Contribute To Sleep Disturbances  F06282

# What are the underlying factors that contribute to sleep disturbances in individuals with insomnia?

You need enough melatonin to get to sleep and stay asleep. But, melatonin supplements may not be the best idea because you’re not fixing the root cause of your sleep problem.  Melatonin comes from another hormone called serotonin—90% of the serotonin in your body is made with the help of your friendly bacteria. 

Your friendly bacteria turns tryptophan into serotonin and then converts it to melatonin. But, you also need vitamin B6 to help with these conversions.  If you have trouble sleeping, it’s important to focus on supporting your microbiome. 

**Here are a few fantastic ways to support the microbiome so you can start sleeping better:**

• Take probiotics 

• Take vitamin B6

• Consume kefir 

• Consume fermented foods (sauerkraut or kimchi)

• Consume fiber from vegetables (unless you have a gut problem)

## What Are The Benefits Of Magnesium Stearate In Emergency Immune Suppor 84B301

# What are the benefits of magnesium stearate in Emergency Immune Support supplement, and how does it enhance product stability and absorption?

**Magnesium Stearate**  

Magnesium stearate is a common additive used in supplements, primarily as a lubricant and flow agent. 

- **Lubricant:** Magnesium stearate reduces friction between ingredients and manufacturing equipment during production. This prevents the ingredients from sticking to the machinery, ensuring smooth production and consistent capsule filling.  

- **Flow Agent:** It improves the flow properties of powders, allowing them to move smoothly through the machinery and fill capsules uniformly. This ensures accurate dosage and consistent product quality.  

- **Safe in Small Amounts:** Magnesium stearate is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA when used in small amounts. The amount typically used in supplements is minimal and is not considered harmful.

## What Factors Or Conditions Are Associated With Over 2000  Increase Ris 8026Db

# What factors or conditions are associated with over 2,000 % increase risk in heart attack?

## The Hidden Heartbreaker: How Stress Can Trigger a Heart Attack

Did you know that one of the biggest threats to your heart health isn't just what you eat or how much you exercise? It's something far less tangible: **stress.**

**Stress: A Silent Killer**

Experiencing the loss of a loved one can increase your risk of a heart attack by over 2000% within the first 24 hours. This shocking statistic highlights the profound impact stress can have on your cardiovascular system.

But it's not just grief that poses a danger. Stress, whether physical, mental, real, or imagined, triggers a cascade of physiological responses that can damage your heart.

**The Stress Response and Your Heart**

When you encounter a stressful situation, your body releases a surge of hormones, primarily adrenaline and cortisol. While these hormones are essential for survival in short bursts, chronic stress leads to prolonged elevation of cortisol, which can:

- **Suppress your immune system:** Making you more susceptible to infections and autoimmune diseases.

- **Disrupt immune balance:** Stress can damage T-regulatory cells, crucial for immune system regulation.

**Good Stress vs. Bad Stress**

Not all stress is bad. Activities like high-intensity interval training, rock climbing, sports, and even creative pursuits like woodworking or music can provide healthy forms of stress that challenge your body and mind in a positive way.

**Protecting Your Heart from Stress**

Learning to manage stress is crucial for heart health. Here are some strategies:

- **Breathing techniques:** Deep breathing exercises can help calm the nervous system and reduce stress hormones.

- **Adaptogens:** Herbs like ashwagandha can help the body adapt to stress and reduce its negative effects.

- **Nutritional support:** Vitamin B1, magnesium, and a healthy diet can support your body's stress response.

- **Acupressure:** This traditional Chinese medicine technique can help alleviate stress and promote relaxation.

By understanding the impact of stress on your heart and taking proactive steps to manage it, you can significantly reduce your risk of heart disease and improve your overall well-being.

## I Have Not Changed My Meals Or Routine But My Niacin Flush Has Been Di 4Ec2Af

# I have not changed my meals or routine but my niacin flush has been different every day - why is that?

Variability in the body’s response to niacin is common, and it often has more to do with internal or environmental factors than with the supplement itself.

Even though the meal may have been the same each day, digestion can vary. Things like gut motility, enzyme activity, stomach acid, and even the microbiome can change day to day, which can affect how quickly or strongly niacin is absorbed and processed. Stress, hydration levels, hormone fluctuations, how well someone slept, or what else is happening in the body at the time can impact how niacin affects someone. Niacin sensitivity can build over several days of use, making flushes more or less intense or over time, even if the usage stays the same.

Other factors can also impact niacin response. Taking niacin after a hot shower, during a menstrual cycle shift (if applicable), or on a day when the body is already under some sort of inflammatory load can all amplify its effects.

If the customer feels uneasy about the inconsistent response she is having, reassure her that the manufacturer uses highly controlled processes to ensure each capsule contains the intended amount. If she is still unhappy, we do have the refund policy.

## I Cant Quit Carbs. What Should I Do

# I can’t quit carbs. What should I do?

Carbohydrates are highly addictive. We are conditioned as children to feed a carb addiction – most children consume large amounts of sugar daily. Sugars and refined grains are added to baby food, cereal, candy and virtually all processed foods.

Carbs are so addictive because they trigger two hormones: dopamine and serotonin. These are pleasure and happiness hormones.

Over time, an addiction to carbs becomes stronger and stronger. So what can you do to break a carb addiction? Take a look.

- Stop eating immediately – The first thing you should do is start fasting. This will kick-start ketosis, which is when your body burns fat as fuel instead of glucose (sugar). This will begin to heal your neurotransmitter receptors that are triggering intense carb cravings.

- Exercise – This will further increase your fat-burning and allow you to get rid of any excess glucose in your system.

- Avoid triggers – Get rid of all carbohydrates and sugars in the house, avoid images of food (like commercials or unhealthy recipe books), don’t go to restaurants with unhealthy foods, avoid food smells that cause cravings, etc.

- Take B vitamins – All B vitamins are important for lessening the addiction to carbs– especially vitamin B1. Using nutritional yeast is a great way to get your B vitamins.

---

## Does Stress Affect My Weight Loss On Keto

# Does stress affect my weight loss on keto?

Stress may actually prevent ketosis. When you spike cortisol, which is a stress hormone, you could start to break down your protein and turn it into glucose.

Basically, when you have a lot of stress, your blood sugars rise, which will cause insulin to spike to lower the elevated blood sugar.

Over time, this could create insulin resistance, which could lead to diabetes. Synthetic cortisol, like prednisone, may have the same effect.

**What may help:**

- Start increasing your exercise

- Consume vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast)

- Consume potassium (vegetables)

- Consume magnesium (vegetables)

- You can also get Dr. Berg’s Adrenal & Cortisol Support supplement

- You can also get Dr. Berg’s Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula supplement

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## What Are The Most Important Benefits Of Vitamin B5 For Adrenal Glands

# What are the most important benefits of vitamin B5 for adrenal glands?

Vitamin B5 is essential for the adrenals, as it helps with synthesizing acetylcholine, cortisol, epinephrine, serotonin, and melatonin. It plays a key role in producing stress hormones and regulating sleep and mood. Vitamin B5 supports cells controlling the circadian rhythm and helps balance cortisol levels, which is crucial for good sleep.

Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) can be taken as a supplement, but pantethine, an active form, may be more effective. For adrenal or sleep issues, taking 500 to 1,000 mg of vitamin B5 can help lower cortisol and improve sleep.

## What Should I Do If I Have Adrenal Fatigue

# What should I do if I have adrenal fatigue?

The adrenal glands help the body adapt to stress, but stress accumulates from birth, making it crucial to manage. The adrenals have an outer glandular layer and an inner nerve tissue layer, involved in the fight-or-flight response. The pituitary gland controls the adrenals via feedback circuits. Key nutrients for adrenal fatigue remedies include:

**• Vitamin B1:** Stress depletes B1. Nutritional yeast is a great source, or try an adrenal formula.

**• Potassium:** Calms the body. Blood tests don't show true levels since most potassium is inside cells. Fresh vegetables, especially avocados, are excellent sources. An electrolyte powder can also help. Light exercise, particularly walking, is also beneficial for adrenal fatig

## What Is The Best Nutritional Source Of B12

# What is the best nutritional source of B12?

**There are three primary sources of B12 for vegans.**

1\. Nori (red algae)

2\. Chlorella

3\. Spirulina

There are two types of B12. There’s a pseudo B12 (B12 analog) and real B12. B12 analog is similar in chemistry to B12, but not similar in function. So if an algae has large amounts of pseudo B12, it can block real B12. In turn, this can cause a serious deficiency.

Unless you’re taking B12 supplements, I do not recommend that you try to get all of your dietary B12 from nori or spirulina. However, chlorella does contain a significant amount of real B12. This is the best source of vitamin B12 for vegans. You need about 6 tablets or one teaspoon of chlorella twice per day.

## What Is The First Sign That My Kid Is Eating Too Much Sugar

# What is the first sign that my kid is eating too much sugar?

**The number one sign that your child is eating too much sugar is moodiness.** Changes with their mood like grouchiness, irritability, and whining may be happening because they're consuming too much sugar. 

**Popular foods for kids that have hidden sugar:**

• Orange juice

• Apple sauce 

• Fruit juice

• Fruit snacks

• Granola bars 

• Vitamin water

• Mac' n' cheese

Moodiness can be the first symptom, because what happens is the blood sugars go up, insulin kicks in and pushes the blood sugars down, and now they have low blood sugar. Moodiness is a symptom of low blood sugar. 

1. **Sugar**, in general, interferes with different parts of the brain and the production of certain neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. These neurotransmitters calm the nervous system. 

2. **Sugar** blocks the absorption of vitamin C. In the presence of sugar, the body can't absorb vitamin C. Vitamin C is necessary to make neurotransmitters. 

3. **Sugar** also depletes zinc, vitamin B1, potassium, and magnesium. All of these are key minerals and vitamins that help calm a child down. 

**When a child is consuming too much sugar, they could:**

• Be hyperactive

• Have attention deficit problems

• Have a difficult time learning, studying, and retaining information

## I Have No Appetite On Intermittent Fasting   What Do I Do

# I have no appetite on Intermittent fasting - what do I do?

As soon as people start doing intermittent fasting, their appetite goes away, they feel better, they have less inflammation, and they have more energy. But, the thing that most people focus on is weight loss. Many think that the more weight they lose, the healthier they are. But weight loss is just one part of getting healthy.

One problem that many people have is they begin to stop doing healthy keto. This is a huge problem, especially when you're doing one meal a day. Why? Because this can cause some serious nutrient deficiencies. Some nutrient deficiencies take a long time to develop. Others happen quickly. Vitamin B12, for instance, can be stored in the body for up to a year. Other nutrients like potassium aren't stored for very long.
If you felt great when you first started intermittent fasting, but down the road, you started to feel worse and worse, this is a sign of a nutrient deficiency.
**
Signs you may have nutritional deficiencies:**

• Tiredness

• Dizziness

• Weakness

• No endurance

• Hair loss

• Brittle nails

• Mood changes

• Cognitive issues

**If you start consuming just one meal a day on your intermittent fasting program, you should increase your intake of:**

• Omega 3 fatty acids (unless you consume salmon and other fatty fish every other day)

• Protein (8-10 oz. athletes may need more)

• Vitamin C/E/B9/D (eat your vegetables!)

• Minerals

• Trace Minerals

## Does Fasting Help With Adhd

# Does fasting help with ADHD?

Some fascinating research shows that intermittent fasting and prolonged fasting may significantly affect the brain's frontal lobe and create significant improvements in cognition. 

**Fasting may potentially help improve cognitive functions, including:**

• Focus 

• Memory 

• Concentration

• Clarity 

• Creativity 

**The study relates to improving the front part of the brain, which is involved with:**

• Paying attention

• Making decisions

• Organizing 

• Planning 

Experts will say that ADHD is a chemical imbalance, that it's genetics, or that the brain is somehow rewired for these symptoms. But, these theories have never been proven. There are medications, but they have side effects that may even potentially create the same symptoms they're supposed to get rid of. 

Basically, with fasting, you stop feeding the brain glucose. As a survival mechanism, the body switches over to making a preferred source of fuel called ketones.  Certain parts of the brain need glucose, but the body can make the glucose it needs from non-carbohydrate sources like fat and protein. You don't need to consume glucose to feed the brain glucose. 

When you fast, you give the brain ketones. Ketones can do many incredible things, including potentially improving cognitive functions. 

**If you have any problems with focus, concentration, or clarity, you may want to try fasting as well as a few other things, including:**

• Vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast) 

• Zinc 

• Omega-3 fatty acids

## Why Do People Fail With Intermittent Fasting

# Why do people fail with intermittent fasting?

There are a few reasons someone might fail at intermittent fasting. The first is that they never even start, because they are afraid of starvation and extreme discomfort as they do not understand how well the body adapts to fasting. Some are too used to eating multiple times a day and cannot find the motivation to cut down their eating window.

Others start the intermittent fasting diet but quit after the first few days because they feel worse. This is because they do not understand it takes some time to adjust. These early transitional symptoms can be alleviated by taking potassium, sodium, and B1. The final reason people quit is because they are not losing weight. In this instance, it is important to focus on the many other positive benefits fasting has provided you, like improved energy, decreased cravings, less hunger, and increased mental clarity.

## Can I Fast For More Than 24 Hours

# Can I fast for more than 24 hours?

Dr. Berg Nutritionals staff, including Dr. Berg Advisors, do *not* encourage prolonged fasting. We are not healthcare professionals equipped with the tests and facilities to perform the necessary monitoring during a prolonged fast, nor do we have an individual's medical health records. Dr. Berg Advisors provides this document based on Dr. Berg's education for informational purposes only to those already on a prolonged fast or independently choosing to do one.

**Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting a prolonged fast.  If you're considering prolonged fasting, discussing the benefits and risks with your healthcare provider is essential.**

[Dr. Berg's Guidelines for Prolonged Fasting.docx](https://realdrberg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shawnh_drberg_com/EazcZ9dNJ6VDhEOO13hV0F8BnVvc-Ge6y2mYjpN-FnojYg?e=RHdisz&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI1MC8yNDAzMzEwMTgxNyIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D).

 If you fast longer than 24 hours, you need to know HOW to do it healthily and not do it without the electrolytes and other nutrients built up as a reserve.

In this video, Dr. Berg talks about how long you need to fast for.

## Why Am I Tired On Keto

# Why am I tired on Keto?

Many of my patients ask me why they feel lethargic and fatigued when they go into ketosis. First, let’s talk about what ketosis is. On a ketogenic diet, you switch from using sugar as your primary fuel source to using fat. The purpose of fat is to protect the body from starving of sugar. So when you eliminate sugar, you naturally start burning fat. Most people don’t start burning fat reserves because they have a little too much sugar or carbs in their diet. You have to starve the body of sugar to really get into ketosis. To break down fat and turn it into fuel, your body now has to create new enzymes. This can take between three days and two weeks. There’s one nutrient that helps with this process. Without it, you are going to feel fatigued and lethargic. This nutrient is vitamin B5. This is a helper vitamin that boosts the metabolism of fat. Vitamin B5 also supports the adrenal glands, which helps with adrenal fatigue.

If you are tired on keto, grab some vitamin B5 from the health foods store and see how it affects your energy levels.

## What Is The Most Effective Remedy For The Pain In The Back

# What is the most effective remedy for the pain in the back?

Sciatica is pain down the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve comes from the lumbar spine all the way down the back part of the leg and into the foot. It’s the longest and biggest nerve in the body. The sciatic nerve needs certain nutrients to function correctly. But, the deficiency that will create the most damage to the sciatic nerve is a vitamin B2 deficiency (riboflavin). But, B12 and B1 are also important. Taking the whole B complex may be the best way to go. Benfotiamine may also be beneficial. Benfotiamine is fat-soluble B1.

A vitamin B2 deficiency can be caused by not consuming enough foods that are high in vitamin B2. But, it can also be caused by a problem with the gut that destroys your ability to absorb nutrients. In this situation, you may just need more than the average amount of B2.

**Foods high in vitamin B2:**

• Liver

• Beef

• Clams (and other shellfish)

• Mushrooms

•Nuts

• Cheese

• Eggs

• Fish

• Green vegetables

## What Are The Most Important Benefits Of Vitamin B5

# What are the most important benefits of Vitamin B5?

**Vitamin B5 is essential for the synthesis of:**

• Acetylcholine (good for focus and memory)

• Cortisol

• Epinephrine

• Serotonin

• Melatonin

Vitamin B5 is very important for creating stress hormones, as well as the hormones involved in sleep and your mood. Vitamin B5 can also directly support the cell that controls the circadian rhythm.

Vitamin B5 is needed to make cortisol. Vitamin B5 also helps regulate cortisol, so it’s not too high or too low. You’re not going to be able to sleep if you have high cortisol.

You can take pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) as a supplement. But, there is another version of pantothenic acid called pantethine that may be more powerful. Pantethine is like the active form of pantothenic acid. If you have adrenal problems or sleep problems, you may want to take between 500 and 1,000mg of vitamin B5 to help lower cortisol and promote better sleep.

## What Is The Most Effective Remedy For Emotional Instability

# What is the most effective remedy for emotional instability?

**Vitamin B1 deficiency** can lead to emotional instability and delirium, particularly affecting brain regions like the hippocampus, amygdala, and mammillary bodies. It's crucial to maintain adequate intake of B1, as it's water-soluble and not stored in large amounts by the body. Higher carbohydrate or sugar consumption increases the body's need for vitamin B1. Consulting with a doctor before altering your diet or starting supplements is advisable, especially for those with existing health conditions.

## What Is An Effective Remedy For Twitching And Frequent Blinking

# What is an effective remedy for twitching and frequent blinking?

Involuntary muscle movements like twitching and frequent blinking can stem from conditions such as Tourette's syndrome, Tardive Dyskinesia, Dystonia, or side effects from certain medications. Damage to the extrapyramidal part of the brain, which regulates these movements, can also be a factor.

Research suggests that sufficient manganese intake, around 10mg three times daily, may help improve these symptoms by supporting the function of the extrapyramidal system. When taking manganese supplements, it's advisable to also supplement with magnesium and vitamin B3 (niacin) for optimal efficacy.

## What Can Help Battle Fluid Retention On Keto Diet Or Any Diet

# What can help battle fluid retention on Keto diet or any diet?

Let's discuss water retention and weight gain in the context of the ketogenic diet.

Water retention, characterized by an excessive buildup of fluid in the circulatory system, can be influenced by various factors in the ketogenic diet. It's important to note that the weight gain observed is typically related to water rather than actual fat.

Let's discuss water retention and weight gain in the context of the ketogenic diet. Water retention, characterized by an excessive buildup of fluid in the circulatory system, can be influenced by various factors in the ketogenic diet. It's important to note that the weight gain observed is typically related to water rather than actual fat. Causes of Water Retention:

1\. Low Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): A deficiency in Vitamin B1 can lead to fluid retention and ankle edema. Adding nutritional yeast to your diet can help address this deficiency.

2\. Low Potassium: Inadequate vegetable consumption can result in low potassium levels. However, if you're still experiencing fluid retention despite consuming many vegetables, it could be due to an inability to digest excessive fiber. Leafy greens are an excellent source of potassium.

3\. Fiber: Both soluble and insoluble fiber can contribute to fluid retention. Fiber demands fluid to bulk up and facilitate the passage of stool through the digestive system.

4\. High Salt Intake: Excessive salt consumption can contribute to water retention.

5\. High Carbohydrate Intake: Consuming too many carbs is associated with fluid retention because carbohydrates have the ability to retain fluid.

It's crucial to understand that on the ketogenic diet, any observed weight gain is predominantly water weight, not fat. Adjusting your diet to address specific nutrient deficiencies and moderating fiber intake can help manage water retention and promote a healthier balance.

# Why Does Dr. Berg Use Synthetic Ingredients - Benfotamine

**Why Are Synthetic Ingredients Used in Dr. Berg’s Products?**

In the world of supplements, natural isn’t always better, and synthetic doesn’t mean unsafe or inferior. Synthetic ingredients are often chosen because they’re the only way to deliver precise, powerful, and proven results. Here’s why certain synthetic ingredients are used in Dr. Berg’s formulas:

**Benfotiamine (Synthetic Vitamin B1)**

Superior Absorption: Benfotiamine is specifically designed for your body to utilize it, unlike standard thiamine, which passes through the body quickly. This synthetic form is fat-soluble, so it crosses cell membranes and reaches nerve tissues where it’s needed most.

Targeted Benefits: You’d have to take large doses of standard thiamine to match the effectiveness of benfotiamine. This form was created specifically to help support nerve health in a way that natural thiamine simply can’t.

 Exclusively Synthetic: Benfotiamine isn’t found in nature—it must be created in a lab. This synthetic form ensures a consistently pure, potent, and bioavailable dose that nature does not provide.

Bottom Line: Benfotiamine isn’t used to avoid natural ingredients—it’s used because it is not found in nature and works better, faster, and more reliably than standard natural thiamine.

## Is The Nerve Pain Connected To Vitamin B6 Toxicity

# Is the nerve pain connected to Vitamin B6 toxicity?

Vitamin B6 is a crucial nutrient involved in numerous bodily functions, including nerve health, metabolism, and neurotransmitter synthesis. However, for some individuals, excessive or even moderate intake of Vitamin B6 can lead to a condition known as peripheral neuropathy, which manifests as nerve pain.

**Forms of Vitamin B6**

There are different forms of Vitamin B6, with the two most common in supplements being:

Pyridoxine Hydrochloride: This synthetic form of Vitamin B6 is widely used in many supplements.

Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate (P-5-P): This is the active, coenzyme form of Vitamin B6. It is considered more bioavailable, meaning the body can utilize it directly without conversion. Proponents suggest it may be less likely to cause adverse effects than pyridoxine hydrochloride, especially at higher doses, because it's already in the form the body uses.

**The Link Between Vitamin B6 and Nerve Pain**

Despite the perceived benefits of P-5-P, for some individuals, even moderate amounts of Vitamin B6, regardless of its form, may contribute to neuropathic symptoms in certain susceptible individuals. This can occur, particularly with long-term supplementation.

Individual Sensitivity: While many people can tolerate various levels of Vitamin B6 without issues, some may have a lower tolerance. In such cases, even moderate amounts might trigger or worsen nerve pain.

Symptoms: Nerve pain related to B6 toxicity often presents as tingling, numbness, burning sensations, or sharp pain, typically in the hands and feet.

**What to Do If You Experience Nerve Pain While Taking B6**

If you are experiencing nerve pain and taking supplements containing Vitamin B6, it is highly recommended to:

Consult Your Healthcare Professional: Discuss your symptoms and all the supplements you are taking with your doctor. They can help determine if there is a connection between your B6 intake and your nerve pain.

Review Supplement Labels: Pay close attention to the dosage and the form of Vitamin B6 in all your supplements, as the combined daily intake from multiple products can add up.

It's crucial to follow personalized medical guidance, as managing nerve pain and supplement use requires careful consideration of individual health circumstances.

## Do I Need Vitamin B1 If Im On A High Carbohydrate Diet

# Do I need Vitamin B1 if I'm on a high carbohydrate diet?

Many individuals consume diets high in carbohydrates, which can deplete levels of Vitamin B1 (Thiamine). Vitamin B1 is essential for properly metabolizing carbohydrates, allowing the body to convert them into usable energy. When B1 is deficient, this metabolic pathway is impaired, hindering the body's ability to effectively process carbohydrates. This can lead to an accumulation of substances like lactic acid in the muscles. Consequences associated with this impaired metabolism and B1 deficiency can include symptoms such as restless leg syndrome, increased acidity, fatigue, and a higher risk of developing conditions like diabetes.

## Do I Really Need Fiber To Avoid Constipation

# Do I really need fiber to avoid constipation?

Constipation is congestion in your gut—you have too much stool. Fiber increases stool volume. Fiber also causes your microbes to create fermentation, which leads to gas and bloating. Some studies suggest that consuming fiber can even worsen conditions like chronic constipation or SIBO. The biggest mistake people make when dealing with constipation is consuming more fiber.

How to deal with constipation naturally:

1\. Reduce your fiber

2\. Talk to your doctor about whether or not it’s a side effect of a medication (and what to do if it is)

3\. Consume vitamin B1

4\. Lower your stress

5\. Take bile salts

6\. Take a probiotic

7\. Do intermittent fasting

8\. Consume a moderate amount of protein

9\. Consume betaine hydrochloride and apple cider vinegar

## How Can I Sleep Better At Night

# How can I sleep better at night?

Cortisol should be at its lowest point at 2 a.m., but for some, it’s at its highest! This can cause night waking and other sleep problems that can really interfere with your day. Sleep medication can worsen this problem by causing your cortisol to rise even more.

Magnesium glycinate before bed can help lower cortisol, which can help you sleep better at night. Twitching and cramping can signify a magnesium deficiency.

Low blood sugar can increase cortisol and cause you to wake up at night. If your diet is high in carbs, your blood sugar may decrease while sleeping, and your body will increase cortisol levels to normalize your blood sugar. If you’re waking up at 2 a.m., evaluate what you ate the day before.

Refined starches, MSG, alcohol, snacking, and eating late can disturb sleep.

Salt cravings can signify a sodium deficiency. Sodium helps lower cortisol, so add more sea salt to your meals throughout the day if you’re having salt cravings.

The liver detoxifies the body between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. Night waking during this time frame could signify a problem with the liver. Milk thistle before bed can help.

Restless legs syndrome can be related to a B1 or magnesium deficiency.

Lower your carb intake and increase your consumption of these nutrients. A high pulse rate could signify a potassium deficiency, which can also interfere with sleep.

Apple cider vinegar before bed can help stabilize blood sugar for better sleep, but make sure it’s diluted.

## What Are The Three Best Foods For Hair Loss And How Do They Promote Ha Bc32B5

# What are the three best foods for hair loss, and how do they promote hair health and growth?

A study has shown that over 90 percent of people suffering from alopecia are deficient in an amino acid called histidine. This essential amino acid is a precursor to histamine, which plays a vital role in immune reactions, allergies, and inflammation.

Deficiencies in histidine can lead to anemia, while excessive intake can cause premature ejaculation. However, the right amount of histidine in your diet can promote healthy hair growth by helping to produce keratin and regulating copper and zinc levels.

Certain medications and alcohol consumption may lower histidine levels in the body, while inadequate stomach acid can hinder its absorption from food sources. To counter this issue, betaine hydrochloride can be taken as an acidifier.

But to fully utilize histidine, specific co-factors must be present, such as vitamin B6, proper copper and zinc ratios, and folate.

The top three foods that can help combat hair loss are

1\. Organ meats, including liver, due to the histidine and other essential nutrients they contain.

2\. Animal proteins, such as beef and chicken, are rich in histidine and other amino acids necessary for hair regeneration.

3\. Shellfish, particularly shrimp, scallops, and crabs, provide high levels of zinc and copper that can help maintain proper ratios in the body.

It's important to note that having enough folate in your diet is essential for hair development. It's best to obtain folate from natural sources, as taking supplements such as folic acid may inhibit the conversion of histidine into its active form.

## How Can I Use My Feet To Determine If I Have An Ongoing Health Condition

# How can I use my feet to determine if I have an ongoing health condition?

The foot receives oxygen and nutrition from the heart through tiny capillaries. The following feet symptoms are also potential signs of diseases.

1\. Peripheral neuropathy

This shows up as numbness or burning in the feet due to low vitamin B1 (thiamine). Benfotiamine, a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1, may help.

2\. Fingers or toes turn blue

This can be related to an overactive sympathetic nervous system. This is often treated medically with calcium channel blockers. Magnesium is a natural calcium channel blocker and the primary regulator of calcium inside the cells. Magnesium glycinate is the most absorbable form of magnesium.

3\. Foot cramps

Foot cramps and charlie horses in the calves are among the earliest signs of magnesium deficiency. Try taking 400 to 800 mg of magnesium glycinate for several weeks to alleviate foot cramps.

4\. Swollen feet

Swelling of feet typically involves diabetes and excess sugar in the blood, which causes sodium and water retention. The solution is to remove sugar from the diet.

5\. Discoloration of lower legs and feet

This is often caused by a circulation problem. Deep vein thrombosis is a condition where you develop clots in the veins of the lower legs. This can cause fluid retention and discoloration of the lower legs and feet.

6\. Big toe pain

Pain in the big toe is usually a symptom of gout caused by too much uric acid. Decreasing oxalates in the diet can sometimes solve this problem. Magnesium can also help decrease oxalates.

## What Does Folate 100 Mcg Dfe Mean On The B1 Bottle

# What does folate 100 mcg DFE mean on the B1+ bottle?

Dietary Folate Equivalents (DFE) is a unit of measurement used to account for the varying bioavailability of folate from different sources.

1\. 1 mcg DFE = 1 mcg of food folate (naturally occurring in foods like leafy greens or legumes) .

2\. 1 mcg DFE = 0.6 mcg of folic acid (from fortified foods or supplements consumed with food) .

3\. 1 mcg DFE = 0.5 mcg of folic acid (from supplements taken on an empty stomach)

Our folate in B1+ comes from food folate.

Our manufacturer included DFE on the Natural B1+ label to comply with the updated folate labeling requirement for supplements. The folate content in the B1+, including DFE, has not changed; only the labeling requirement has been updated.

## What Are The Health Benefits Of Beets And How Do Their Compounds Contr D48B7D

# What are the health benefits of beets, and how do their compounds contribute to these effects?

Beets are a nutritional powerhouse that deserve a regular spot in your diet. They're not only keto-friendly, but also offer a wealth of health benefits.

**Beets: A Keto-Friendly Superfood**

Contrary to popular belief, beets are perfectly compatible with the keto diet. Their high fiber content balances out the carbs, making them a great choice for those watching their insulin and blood sugar levels. Just remember, beet juice is not keto-friendly due to its lack of fiber.

**Nutritional Benefits**

Beets are low in net carbs and calories, yet packed with essential nutrients. They're an excellent source of vitamin C, vitamin B6, folate, potassium, manganese, and copper. Beets also contain unique betalains, plant chemicals with impressive health-boosting properties.

**Five Reasons to Eat Beets Regularly**

1. **Support Healthy Blood Pressure:** Beets' high nitrate content converts to nitric oxide, a vasodilator that widens blood vessels, improving blood flow and reducing blood pressure. This significantly lowers the risk of stroke and heart disease.

2. **Promote Eye Health:** Beet greens are rich in carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin, which protect your eyes from oxidative damage and safeguard retinal cells from UV light. This promotes retinal health and reduces the risk of age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma.

3. **Support Detoxification:** Beets are a top source of betalains, which promote the release of enzymes needed for detoxification. Betalains also help balance blood lipid levels and may benefit those with fatty liver disease.

4. **Combat Inflammation:** Beets are packed with anti-inflammatory nutrients like betalains, carotenoids, and phytochemicals. This helps reduce chronic inflammation, a major contributor to many diseases like cancer, heart disease, and arthritis.

5. **Lower Cancer Risk:** Beets contain compounds that may lower the risk of several cancers, including prostate, breast, liver, and stomach cancer. Their high folate content also protects DNA from damage, reducing the risk of mutations and cancer development.

## What Methods Can Quickly Relieve Bloating And Address Its Underlying C 034470

# What methods can quickly relieve bloating and address its underlying causes for long-term relief?

Bloating, that uncomfortable feeling of fullness and tightness in your abdomen, can be a real mystery. But don't worry; we're here to decode this common issue so you can say goodbye to it for good.

**What Triggers Bloating?**

- **Diet:** Certain foods, like those high in fiber, fat, or specific carbs, can lead to excess gas and bloating. Eating too quickly or not chewing properly can also make you swallow air, adding to the problem.

- **Gut Microbes:** The billions of bacteria in your gut play a crucial role in digestion. Sometimes, their gas production gets a little too enthusiastic, causing bloating.

- **FODMAPs:** These carbohydrates found in various foods like fruits, grains, legumes, and dairy can be major bloat culprits. A low-FODMAP diet might help, but remember, it's not one-size-fits-all.

- **Allergies & Sensitivities:** If you're allergic or sensitive to gluten, lactose, or nuts, your gut can become inflamed and lead to bloating.

- **Stress:** Chronic stress slows down digestion, causing food to linger in your system longer and gas to build up. Vitamin B1 might help with stress-related bloating.

- **Constipation:** When waste gets backed up in your intestines, it can lead to bloating. Instead of relying on laxatives, address the root cause of constipation with fiber, hydration, and exercise.

- **Menstrual Cramps:** Cramps can also cause bloating. Calcium and magnesium supplements might help alleviate cramps and reduce associated bloating.

- **Vegetables:** Some veggies, like broccoli and cauliflower, are high in fiber and can cause gas and bloating. However, others, like cabbage, might help reduce bloating due to their anti-inflammatory properties.

**The Bottom Line**

Bloating is a complex issue with various causes. By understanding these factors, you can take steps to prevent and manage it. Remember, it's about finding what works best for your body and making adjustments to your diet and lifestyle.

So, the next time you feel like you've swallowed a balloon, don't despair. Armed with this knowledge, you can take control and bid farewell to bloating for good.

## What Interventions Can Quickly Relieve Abdominal Gas And Bloating And  66Cb68

# What interventions can quickly relieve abdominal gas and bloating, and how do they address the underlying causes?

Struggling with abdominal gas and bloating? You're not alone! This common issue affects countless individuals, causing discomfort and frustration. But don't worry, there are solutions.

**What Causes Gas and Bloating?**

Before jumping to conclusions like irritable bowel syndrome or celiac disease, consider these four potential culprits:

1. **SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth):** An excess of bacteria in the small intestine leads to gas production (hydrogen and methane), causing bloating, constipation, and abdominal pain. A hydrogen methane breath test can diagnose SIBO.

2. **Too Many Methanogens:** These microbes produce hydrogen and methane gas, consuming starches and sugars. An imbalance can cause bloating and constipation.

3. **Low Stomach Acid:** Insufficient stomach acid hinders protein digestion, leading to gas and bloating. It can also contribute to SIBO development.

4. **Decreased Bile:** Bile, produced by the liver, is essential for fat digestion. Insufficient bile can cause gas, bloating, and pain on the right side of the body.

**What to Do About It:**

1. **Lower Carbs and Fiber:** Reduce your intake of carbohydrates and fiber, especially for a month if your symptoms are severe. Opt for cooked vegetables over raw and avoid synthetic carbohydrates and fibers. Intermittent fasting can also help clear your system.

2. **Add Betaine HCL:** This natural amino acid compound increases hydrochloric acid, aiding protein digestion, mineral absorption, and microbe elimination. Take supplements before meals, avoiding calcium at the same time.

3. **Avoid Dairy:** If you're lactose intolerant or sensitive to casein, eliminate dairy products from your diet.

4. **Add Bile Salts:** If you experience pain on your right side, try purified bile salts after meals. Combine with betaine hydrochloride before meals for optimal digestion.

**Conclusion:**

By understanding these potential causes and following the recommended solutions, you can overcome gas, bloating, and related digestive issues. Remember, consult your doctor for personalized advice and diagnosis.

## Niacin And Cellular Health

# Niacin and Cellular Health

Niacin (Vitamin B3) plays a significant role in supporting cellular health through its involvement in several key biological processes:

---

### **1\. Role in Cellular Energy and Health**

- **NAD+ Production**: Niacin is essential for synthesizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a coenzyme critical for energy production in cells. NAD+ supports mitochondrial function, which is vital for maintaining cellular energy and preventing premature cell aging.

---

### **2\. One-Carbon Metabolism**

- **DNA Methylation**: Niacin indirectly helps contribute to methylation cycles by ensuring sufficient energy (through NAD+) for pathways, including the synthesis of SAMe (S-adenosylmethionine), a critical methyl donor in one-carbon metabolism. Proper methylation impacts gene expression, DNA repair, and cellular functions.

---

### **3\. Telomere Health**

- **Cell Longevity**: NAD+ has been linked to maintaining and potentially repairing telomeres, the protective caps on chromosomes. Healthier telomeres can slow aging-related cellular damage.

---

### **4\. Cancer Prevention**

- **DNA Repair and Anti-Inflammation**: Niacin and NAD+ are crucial for DNA repair enzymes (like PARPs), which help fix damaged DNA, potentially reducing cancer risk. Niacin also helps regulate inflammation, which, when excessive, is a known risk factor for cancer.

---

### **5\. Antioxidant Defense**

- **Reducing Oxidative Stress**: By supporting energy pathways and enzyme systems, niacin may help reduce oxidative stress, a factor in cellular damage and aging-related diseases.

---

Niacin is vital for mitochondrial function, DNA repair, and inflammation for overall cellular health.

## B12 Deficiency Symptoms That You Should Never Ignore

# B12 Deficiency Symptoms That You Should NEVER Ignore

While it's true that vegans and vegetarians are at a higher risk, vitamin B12 deficiency can affect anyone. This crucial nutrient plays a role in DNA production and repair, and a deficiency can elevate your cancer risk. It also supports nerve health, and a shortage can lead to anemia.

Early signs of deficiency include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, and tingling in the extremities.

As the deficiency progresses, you might experience:

• Tongue changes (red, swollen, shiny)

• Mouth ulcers

• Shortness of breath

• Dizziness upon standing

• Cognitive issues

• Anxiety and depression

• Sleep disruptions

• Vitiligo (skin patches)

Severe deficiency can result in walking difficulties, muscle weakness, and serious psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations. It can even lead to permanent nerve damage.

If you don't eat animal products regularly, you're at risk. Incorporate foods like clams, liver, sardines, red meat, tuna, salmon, grass-fed dairy, and eggs into your diet.

Low stomach acid or a genetic issue called polymorphism can also hinder B12 absorption.

If you supplement, choose methylcobalamin, the natural form. Remember, a healthy liver, small intestine, and acidic stomach are essential for proper B12 absorption and function.

## What Are The Most Effective Remedies And Treatment Approaches For Mana 871763

# What are the most effective remedies and treatment approaches for managing ADD/ADHD, and how do these methods address both the symptoms and underlying causes of the condition?

**Niacinamide and Its Potential for Managing ADD/ADHD**

Research by Dr. William Kaufman, M.D., indicates that high doses of niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3) may effectively address symptoms of ADD and ADHD. Niacinamide is crucial for the production of NAD, which facilitates cellular energy conversion from food into ATP. By enhancing energy in nerve cells, niacinamide can help reduce hyperactivity and improve focus.

Due to its water-soluble nature, niacinamide is quickly metabolized, necessitating frequent dosing—around 250 mg six to eight times daily. This approach can be beneficial for both adults and children with ADD or ADHD. However, it is essential to complement supplementation with a balanced diet and consult a healthcare provider before making any changes to medication or treatment plans.

## Use Your Feet To Diagnose Liver Problems

# Use Your Feet to Diagnose Liver Problems

One common sign of liver problems is red and brown spots on the lower leg. These spots are caused by poor circulation and are often seen in people who have diabetes or cirrhosis of the liver. When the liver isn't functioning properly, you may experience bruising and discoloration.

You may also notice that the lower leg is swollen and shiny and no longer grows hair. Pitting edema may accompany these symptoms. The good news about liver problems is that the liver is one of the only organs that can completely regenerate itself!

Spider veins, whether in the lower leg and foot or anywhere else on the body, signify that the liver can no longer regulate estrogen. Excess estrogen can cause a fatty liver and problems with your bile ducts, which can lead to gallstones.

Dry, cracked heels or generally dry feet are symptoms of an omega-3 deficiency.

The liver makes bile, which helps you break down and absorb fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients. If you have liver damage, it will be difficult to absorb omega-3 fatty acids. Rarely, dry, cracked heels may be related to a B3 deficiency.

Other foot-related symptoms that typically signify liver damage include:

•Itchy feet

•Fungal infections

•Inflammatory conditions like arthritis and plantar fasciitis

•Foot odor

•Hot/cold feet

•Toenail fungus

•Fungus between toes

7. **Sleep Apnea:** High insulin levels can contribute to sleep apnea, disrupting breathing during sleep.

8. **Hypoglycemia:** The body overcompensates for high blood sugar with insulin, leading to low blood sugar episodes at night.

9. **Delayed Sleep:** High sugar levels interfere with melatonin release, making it harder to fall asleep.

10. **Gastric Reflux (GERD):** High blood sugar affects the valve controlling stomach acid, leading to nighttime heartburn.

11. **Nightmares/Vivid Dreams:** Vitamin B1 deficiency, linked to high blood sugar, disrupts neurotransmitters and can cause vivid dreams.

12. **High Blood Pressure:** Blood pressure doesn't dip normally during sleep in people with diabetes, potentially causing nighttime hypertension.

13. **Heart Palpitations:** Electrolyte imbalances due to high blood sugar can lead to heart palpitations at night.

14. **Teeth Grinding:** Stress response triggered by high blood sugar can cause nighttime teeth grinding.

15. **Headache Upon Waking:** Dehydration from high blood sugar can result in morning headaches.

# Does Allithiamine require enzymatic breakdown?

Allithiamine does not need enzymatic breakdown like some other forms of thiamine. It is a lipid-soluble form of vitamin B1, which means it can be absorbed more efficiently and bypass some of the transport mechanisms that regular thiamine requires. This lipid solubility is due to its chemical structure, which includes an allyl disulfide group, allowing it to cross cell membranes more efficiently without needing enzyme conversion.

More information on this topic is available here - [https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/biochemistry1922/41/1/41\_1\_29/\_pdf](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/biochemistry1922/41/1/41_1_29/_pdf)

## Does Allithiamine Bypass All Transport Mechanisms

# Does Allithiamine bypass all transport mechanisms?

Allithiamine does not bypass all transport mechanisms. It is absorbed through a specialized entry mechanism, which means its absorption is rate-limited and not entirely passive. This indicates that while allithiamine may have a more accessible transport across the intestinal wall than free thiamine, it still relies on specific transport processes rather than completely bypassing them.

Further information can be researched here - [https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnsv1973/22/Supplement/22\_Supplement\_63/\_pdf](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnsv1973/22/Supplement/22_Supplement_63/_pdf)

## What Are The Potential Reasons And Considerations For Avoiding The Use A1D155

# What are the potential reasons and considerations for avoiding the use of valerian root before sleep?

**Valerian Root: Helps with Anxiety, Not So Much with Sleep**

Valerian root is a natural herb with calming effects. It works similarly to medications like Valium by influencing GABA, a neurotransmitter that reduces stress and promotes relaxation. This can be helpful for anxiety, but there's a catch:

- **Valerian's Sedative Effects:** While it calms anxiety, valerian can cause drowsiness, sluggishness, even insomnia for some. It's NOT a reliable sleep aid.

**Getting to the Root Cause**

Anxiety and sleep problems are often symptoms of deeper imbalances:

- **Hormones:** High cortisol (the stress hormone) is a major culprit.

- **Melatonin/Serotonin Connection:** Low melatonin affects sleep, and can also contribute to low serotonin, linked to depression.

**Natural Solutions: Beyond Supplements**

While you CAN supplement melatonin, it's best to support your body's own production. Here's how:

1. **Exercise:** Gets your body primed for healthy sleep cycles.

2. **Sunlight:** Infrared rays naturally boost melatonin.

3. **Vitamin B1:** Found in nutritional yeast, sunflower seeds. Supports overall nervous system health.

4. **Gut Health:** Probiotics support the production of calming neurotransmitters.

5. **Diet:** Healthy keto and intermittent fasting can benefit hormone balance.

**Important:**

- Valerian may interact with medications. Talk to your doctor before using.

- Lifestyle changes take time but have lasting benefits.

## What Are The Most Beneficial Foods For Mitigating Hair Loss

# What are the most beneficial foods for mitigating hair loss?

A study has shown that over 90 percent of people suffering from alopecia are deficient in an amino acid called histidine. This essential amino acid is a precursor to histamine, which plays a vital role in immune reactions, allergies, and inflammation.

Deficiencies in histidine can lead to anemia, while excessive intake can cause premature ejaculation. However, the right amount of histidine in your diet can promote healthy hair growth by helping to produce keratin and regulating copper and zinc levels.

Certain medications and alcohol consumption may lower histidine levels in the body, while inadequate stomach acid can hinder its absorption from food sources. To counter this issue, betaine hydrochloride can be taken as an acidifier.

But to fully utilize histidine, specific co-factors must be present, such as vitamin B6, proper copper and zinc ratios, and folate.

The top three foods that can help combat hair loss are:

1\. Organ meats, including liver, due to the histidine and other essential nutrients they contain.

2\. Animal proteins, such as beef and chicken, are rich in histidine and other amino acids necessary for hair regeneration.

3\. Shellfish, particularly shrimp, scallops, and crabs, provide high levels of zinc and copper that can help maintain proper ratios in the body.

It's important to note that having enough folate in your diet is essential for hair development. It's best to obtain folate from natural sources, as taking supplements such as folic acid may inhibit the conversion of histidine into its active form.

## Could A Deficiency In Vitamin B12 Be Contributing To My Respiratory Di 1B5C21

# Could a deficiency in vitamin B12 be contributing to my respiratory difficulties during physical activities?

Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in the production of red blood cells, and a deficiency can lead to conditions such as pernicious anemia. Anemia may also stem from deficiencies in folic acid or iron, which can contribute to feelings of fatigue or a lack of energy. It's important to note that B12 is primarily obtained from animal products. However, even if you consume these foods, inadequate hydrochloric acid levels can hinder your ability to extract this essential vitamin from meat proteins. Consequently, various factors can impede B12 absorption, and a deficiency can certainly leave you feeling winded, particularly during physical exertion, such as climbing inclines.

## What Are Natural Solutions For Managing And Alleviating Peripheral Neuropathy

# What are natural solutions for managing and alleviating peripheral neuropathy?

**Peripheral Neuropathy: Natural Solution and the Root Cause**

Peripheral neuropathy is painful nerve damage often felt as burning, tingling, or hypersensitivity in the feet and hands. This video explains what causes peripheral neuropathy and offers a natural solution.

**What causes peripheral neuropathy?**

- **Diabetes:** The most common cause. High blood sugar damages the protective covering (myelin sheath) of nerves.

- **Other causes:** Chemotherapy, hypothyroidism, autoimmune diseases, medications, viruses, and Lyme disease.

**Natural Alternative for Peripheral Neuropathy**

Instead of just treating symptoms, it's vital to address the root cause. Here's how:

- **Benfotiamine:** A form of vitamin B1 that supports nerve health. Take 300mg, four times per day.

- **Lipoic acid:** Helps your body process excess glucose.

## Niacinamide And Addadhd

# Niacinamide and ADD/ADHD

**Important Note:** Before discussing supplements with anyone, especially children, *always* consult with a doctor.

**Niacinamide and ADD/ADHD: Some Background**

- Dr. William Kaufman, M.D. conducted research suggesting high doses of niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3) could potentially be helpful for individuals with ADD or ADHD.

- Vitamin B3 plays a role in creating NAD, a molecule that assists cells with energy production. This may provide more energy to nerve cells, potentially easing hyperactivity and improving focus.

- A well-functioning nervous system is important. Nutrient deficiencies can sometimes affect brain and nervous system activity. Niacinamide's effects may help reduce symptoms of ADD/ADHD.

- Because niacinamide is water-soluble, it doesn't build up in the body. Some sources suggest taking approximately 250mg, 6-8 times a day may be beneficial.

**Important Considerations**

- **Consult with a doctor:** Never change medication routines or dosages without consulting a medical professional.

- **Supplements are not a substitute for healthy eating:** While niacinamide may be helpful, a balanced diet is crucial for managing ADD/ADHD.

**Disclaimer:** This information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

## Folic Acid And B12 Deficiency

# Folic Acid and B12 Deficiency

## **The Masking Effect of Folic Acid on B12 Deficiency**

[Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate](https://www.drberg.com/blog/avoid-folic-acid-and-take-folate-as-methyl-folate), a B vitamin that's essential for DNA synthesis and red blood cell production. It's often added to fortified foods like breakfast cereals and breads to help prevent neural tube defects in pregnancy.

But while folic acid fortification has been successful in reducing the incidence of these birth defects, it may also be masking a hidden problem: vitamin B12 deficiency.

![Pills forming B12 shape](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/yellow-pills-forming-shape-b12-alphabet-0.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

### **Fortified Foods and Nutrient Interactions**

The problem with folic acid is that it can correct the megaloblastic anemia caused by B12 deficiency, but it doesn't address the underlying deficiency itself.

This means that someone could have a serious B12 deficiency but not show any obvious symptoms because the folic acid is masking the anemia.

Over time, untreated B12 deficiency can lead to irreversible neurological damage, even if the anemia is being corrected by folic acid. This is why it's so important to test for B12 deficiency, especially in older adults and vegetarians/vegans who may be at a higher risk.

While food fortification can be a useful tool for preventing nutrient deficiencies, it's important to be aware of potential interactions between nutrients like folic acid and B12.

If you're relying on fortified foods as a major source of your B vitamins, make sure also to include plenty of B12-rich foods in your diet or consider supplementing to ensure you're meeting your needs.

## What Are The Top Foods To Consume For Addressing Hair Loss And How Do  900083

# What are the top foods to consume for addressing hair loss, and how do they support hair health and growth?

A study has shown that over 90 percent of people suffering from alopecia are deficient in an amino acid called histidine. This essential amino acid is a precursor to histamine, which plays a vital role in immune reactions, allergies, and inflammation. Deficiencies in histidine can lead to anemia, while excessive intake can cause premature ejaculation. However, the right amount of histidine in your diet can promote healthy hair growth by helping to produce keratin and regulating copper and zinc levels.

Certain medications and alcohol consumption may lower histidine levels in the body, while inadequate stomach acid can hinder its absorption from food sources. To counter this issue, betaine hydrochloride can be taken as an acidifier. But to fully utilize histidine, specific co-factors must be present, such as vitamin B6, proper copper and zinc ratios, and folate.

**The top three foods that can help combat hair loss are:**

1\. Organ meats, including liver, due to the histidine and other essential nutrients they contain.

2\. Animal proteins, such as beef and chicken, are rich in histidine and other amino acids necessary for hair regeneration.

3\. Shellfish, particularly shrimp, scallops, and crabs, provide high levels of zinc and copper that can help maintain proper ratios in the body.

## The Silent Threat Of Diabetic Retinopathy

# The Silent Threat of Diabetic Retinopathy

## **The Silent Threat of Diabetic Retinopathy**

Diabetic retinopathy is a severe complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness if not addressed promptly.

This condition occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the tiny blood vessels surrounding the nerve in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.

As these blood vessels weaken and leak fluid, it can cause swelling, bleeding, and scarring within the retina. Over time, this damage can progress to the point of irreversible vision loss, making diabetic retinopathy a leading cause of blindness among people with diabetes.

![Eye exam](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/senior-patient-checking-vision-special-eye.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

## High Carb Vs. Healthy Ketogenic Diet

# High-Carb Vs. Healthy Ketogenic Diet

## **High-Carb Vs. Healthy Ketogenic Diets**

A diet abundant in refined carbs can lead to a heightened need for vitamins B1 and C. This is because refining strips away much of their nutritional value, leaving you with empty calories that do little to nourish your body.

### **Why Does Consuming Refined Carbs Increase Our Need For Vitamins?**

The more processed carbohydrates you take in, the harder your body has to work to break them down. This increased metabolic activity requires additional nutrients for support - hence the heightened need for vitamins such as B1 (thiamine) and C (ascorbic acid).

Thiamine is crucial in converting food into energy, while ascorbic acid helps protect cells from damage.

### **Transitioning From Carb-heavy Meals To Balanced Ketogenic Plates**

A healthy ketogenic lifestyle is a diet focused on low-carb, high-fat foods that promote balanced nutrition without overloading your system with unnecessary sugars.

By reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with healthy fats, the keto diet puts your body into a metabolic state known as ketosis, where fat becomes its primary fuel source instead of glucose derived from carbohydrates.

This helps maintain steady blood sugar levels and reduces insulin resistance, promoting better nutrient absorption. To make transitioning easier, gradually reduce your carb intake while increasing healthy fats.

[Incorporate healthy fats into your diet](https://www.drberg.com/ketosis-approved-foods), such as avocados, nuts/seeds, and fatty fish, and include plenty of green leafy vegetables.

## **Conclusion**

Healthy Keto is excellent for weight loss and promotes overall health. A high-fat diet can lower the risk of insulin resistance, help balance hormonal levels, and promote digestive health.

## Acetylcholines Role In Mental Health

# Acetylcholine's Role in Mental Health

## **Acetylcholine's Role in Mental Health**

The brain is like a complex highway, with neurotransmitters acting as traffic signals. Acetylcholine is one such signal, vital for rest and digestion.

### **Acetylcholine Deficiency and Its Effects**

An acetylcholine deficiency can be likened to faulty traffic lights—things go haywire. It can lead to memory loss, difficulty concentrating, or even depression.

Vitamins B1 and C are essential for keeping acetylcholine levels balanced. A lack of these vitamins could put your mental health at risk.

### **Diet's Influence on Acetylcholine Levels**

Eating habits play a significant role, too. Picture high-carb diets and sugar as roadblocks that lower the production of this critical neurotransmitter.

Opting for more greens may help boost your body’s ability to produce acetylcholinic acid, clearing the path.

A persistent exhaustion syndrome, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), correlates to depression. The CDC reports that individuals with CFS are four times more likely to experience major depressive disorder than those without the syndrome.

Dysfunctional mitochondria could be at play here. As powerhouses of our cells, when they fail to produce enough energy, it can result in physical exhaustion and potentially trigger depressive symptoms.

Similarly, viral infections might have a role too. Research suggests that certain viruses, such as [Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/epstein-barr-virus-and-its-main-trigger-stress), often seen in CFS patients, may lead to changes in brain function, contributing to depression.

1\. Overtraining or too much exercise causes the sympathetic nervous system to go up, keeping your adrenaline high and preventing sleep.

2\. If your room is too hot, it can interfere with your sleep quality.

3\. High carb consumption and stress deplete vitamin B1. Vitamin B1 is essential for the parasympathetic nervous system, so a deficiency will keep you up at night. Try taking vitamin B1 before bed for better sleep.

4\. Too much caffeine is a common cause of poor sleep.

5\. Poor gut health can inhibit good sleep. Kefir as a probiotic can help!

6\. Insulin resistance inhibits the absorption of tryptophan, a precursor to melatonin. This can interfere with your ability to fall asleep fast.

7\. Some people have trouble sleeping after being on keto or the carnivore diet for a long period of time. This is because their insulin is very low. Try having a cup of berries with your last meal to fix this problem.

8\. Sodium deficiency can cause problems with your sleep. This can be caused by fasting, OMAD (one meal a day), or not adding enough sodium to your diet. Low sodium can cause your sympathetic nervous system to go up which can keep you from sleeping.

If you want to know how to fall asleep instantly, try this simple sleep technique! You’re going to breathe in a way that synchronizes your heartbeat and blood pressure to the rhythm of your breathing. This will help stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, inducing sleep very quickly. Try practicing with a timer first! Breathe in for 5 ½ seconds and breathe out for 5 ½ seconds. This will give you about 5 ½ breaths per minute. When doing this technique, breathe through your nose, and within minutes you will fall asleep.

## Should I Do A Vegetarian Diet For Hyperthyroidism

# Should I do a vegetarian diet for hyperthyroidism?

For hyperthyroidism, it's crucial to avoid iodine, as it can exacerbate the condition. While iodine may help with thyroid nodules in some cases, it’s not recommended for hyperthyroidism. Instead, consider foods that naturally block iodine absorption, such as cruciferous vegetables. Also, avoid supplements containing bile salts, like Gallbladder Formula, as they can stimulate the thyroid. Incorporating natural vitamin B1 (thiamine) at a higher dosage than standard recommendations may also be beneficial in managing hyperthyroidism.

## Why Do I Wake Up Nauseous And Gagging

# Why do I wake up nauseous and gagging?

Waking up feeling nauseous and experiencing gagging can often be indicative of a vitamin B1 deficiency. Vitamin B1, or thiamine, plays a crucial role in both the nervous system and digestive system function. Ensuring adequate intake of B1 can help alleviate these symptoms, as it supports overall neurological health and digestive processes. If these symptoms persist or worsen, consulting with a healthcare professional is advised for proper evaluation and management.

## What Strategies Can Help Balance Omega 3 And Omega 6 Fatty Acids In Th 25A050

# What strategies can help balance Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids in the diet, and why is this balance important for overall health?

The omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is way off in the average diet. The average American is at a 20:1 and sometimes a 70:1 or more omega-6 to omega-3 ratio!

**We need both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, but we need significantly more omega-3 fatty acids to avoid inflammation.** The source is important! You don’t want to get your omega-6 fatty acids from seed oils.

Omega-6 consumption from seed oils directly correlates with chronic illnesses like heart disease. Very recently in human history, seed oils replaced saturated fat in the diet and are in every ultra-processed food. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids include fatty fish, cod liver oil, cod liver, sardines, and shellfish.

**Grain-fed animals are much higher in omega-6 fatty acids. This is one of the reasons people are turning to grass-fed, grass-finished beef.**

Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids go through the same biochemical pathways and compete with each other in the body. If there’s any problem in these biochemical pathways, you can end up with dysfunctional fats that your body will be unable to benefit from.

Co-factors for these biochemical pathways include magnesium, vitamins B2, B3, B6, vitamin C, and insulin. Many people are insulin resistant, which means they’re deficient in insulin. Seed oil consumption paired with insulin resistance causes a lot more compound damage.

**Intermittent fasting and a low-carb diet can correct insulin resistance so you’re better able to utilize fatty acids within the body and don’t end up with dysfunctional fats.**

Omega-3 fatty acids fall into two categories: DHA and EPA. EPA helps reduce inflammation, and DHA helps support cognitive function. ALA is a precursor to EPA.

There’s a simple blood test that can measure your omega-3 to omega-6 ratio.

## What Natural Things Can I Do For Gastroparesis

# What natural things can I do for gastroparesis?

Gastroparesis, characterized by delayed stomach emptying, often arises from vagus nerve dysfunction linked to thiamine (B1) deficiency. Thiamine is essential for acetylcholine production, vital for vagus nerve function. Insufficient B1 can lead to symptoms like gastroparesis, constipation, and low stomach acid, impairing digestion.

Addressing B1 deficiency through natural supplementation and dietary adjustments is crucial. Avoiding refined carbs, sugars, and excessive caffeine supports B1 levels. Monitoring B1 supplementation effects can potentially alleviate gastroparesis symptoms and enhance digestive health. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of A Burning Sensation On The Tongue And 8F77Af

# What are the potential causes of a burning sensation on the tongue, and how do these factors affect oral health and comfort?

**It’s a vitamin B12 deficiency. Of course, the question is, how do you become B12 deficient? There are several primary causes, including:**

1\. Low stomach acid

2\. Gastric bypass surgery

3\. A problem in your intestines such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or Crohn’s disease

4\. Being a vegan, because B12 mostly comes from eggs, meats and organs, and dairy. If you’re vegan, add B12 in the natural form called methylcobalamin

5\. Alcohol, which is why alcoholics are often B12 deficient. In fact, anyone with liver damage will have difficulty absorbing B12

Now you can find out what’s causing your burning tongue!

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies For Reducing Stress To Its Lowe 4915F9

# What are the most effective strategies for reducing stress to its lowest possible level?

Anxiety is defined as worrying about something that may or may not happen. It can be triggered by speculation, sensationalism, or conjecture. Speculation is when we are concerned about things not based on facts or knowledge, while sensationalism is the use of shocking words or exaggerated stories to grab attention. A conjecture, on the other hand, is an opinion based on guessing rather than the truth.

These triggers can cause anxiety that, if left unchecked, may become chronic and affect our adrenal glands. This, in turn, encourages the release of adrenaline and cortisol, weakening our immune system and accelerating the aging process.

**Limiting exposure to stress through activities such as exercise and spending time in nature is essential to break this cycle. It’s also best to avoid negative messages and sensationalized news that provoke these anxious thoughts.**

**Additionally, incorporating adaptogens into our diet, such as vitamin B1 and ashwagandha, helps to strengthen our ability to cope with daily stress.**

## What Are The Potential Health Benefits Of Wormwood And How Does It Con 3F6Eb6

# What are the potential health benefits of wormwood, and how does it contribute to overall well-being?

This natural herb has been used for thousands of years in Chinese medicine. The synthetic version of wormwood is the most effective treatment for malaria. There is also some interesting research on wormwood for COVID.

**Other potential benefits of wormwood:**

• It’s anti-parasitic

• It may be effective against worms, viruses, bacteria, and Lyme disease

• It’s anti-viral

**What we’re going to focus on today, though, is its effectiveness against cancer.**

**Potential benefits of wormwood for cancer patients:**

1\. It can selectively cause apoptosis in cancer cells.

2\. It oxidizes a small amount of your iron, turning it into a free radical and directing it to the cancer cell. Oxidized iron is toxic to cancer cells.

3\. The phytonutrients in wormwood can inhibit a certain protein complex involved in the process of normal cells converting into cancer cells.

4\. It can inhibit normal cells from producing an increase in blood vessels to a tumor.

5\. It’s anti-inflammatory and may help stop the formation and spread of cancer. 6. It has an anti-metastatic effect, which means it may help inhibit the growth of cancer.

## What Are The Most Important Foods To Eat To Prevent And Manage Hair Lo 990932

# What are the most important foods to eat to prevent and manage hair loss, and how do they support hair health?

**A study has shown that over 90 percent of people suffering from alopecia are deficient in an amino acid called histidine.** This essential amino acid is a precursor to histamine, which plays a vital role in immune reactions, allergies, and inflammation.

**Deficiencies in histidine can lead to anemia, while excessive intake can cause premature ejaculation. However, the right amount of histidine in your diet can promote healthy hair growth by helping to produce keratin and regulating copper and zinc levels.**

Certain medications and alcohol consumption may lower histidine levels in the body, while inadequate stomach acid can hinder its absorption from food sources. To counter this issue, betaine hydrochloride can be taken as an acidifier.

But to fully utilize histidine, specific co-factors must be present, such as vitamin B6, proper copper and zinc ratios, and folate.

**The top three foods that can help combat hair loss are:**

1\. Organ meats, including liver, due to the histidine and other essential nutrients they contain.

2\. Animal proteins, such as beef and chicken, are rich in histidine and other amino acids necessary for hair regeneration.

3\. Shellfish, particularly shrimp, scallops, and crabs, provide high levels of zinc and copper that can help maintain proper ratios in the body.

It's important to note that having enough folate in your diet is essential for hair development. It's best to obtain folate from natural sources, as taking supplements such as folic acid may inhibit the conversion of histidine into its active form.

## What Side Effects Can Iodine Deficiency Have On Iq And Cognitive Funct Be6B2C

# What side effects can iodine deficiency have on IQ and cognitive function, particularly in populations at risk?

Iodine is a trace mineral that supports brain function, thyroid function, child growth, and also helps regulate estrogen. Iodine deficiency can cause a goiter and also affects cognitive function.

Intellectual disability, also known as mental retardation, is characterized by decreased motor skills, slower learning, decreased ability to solve problems, and an IQ of less than 70.

About half of the time, the condition is considered idiopathic. This means that the cause is unknown, but this isn’t true! The most likely cause is an iodine deficiency. If you’re pregnant, consume sea kelp to prevent an iodine deficiency. Sea kelp is the best source of iodine. If you choose an iodine supplement, make sure it’s a food-based source of iodine.

## If I Dont Consume Glucose I Hit A Wall When Running. What Can I Do

# If I don’t consume glucose, I hit a wall when running. What can I do?

I think you just need to kind of study some of the long distance runners that have got into a really good keto adaptation to the point where or fat adaptation, where they can just oxidize fat like way better than anyone else. And because what's happening, you're running up against the loss of glycogen. And now, where's the fuel? Your body just hasn't really been able to tap into the fat because you're not fully converted over yet and that takes some time. That's what I would shoot for as a long term goal.

A couple other things I would recommend. I would maybe as a transition, you do not the glucose but maybe you do some fruit. Try that for a while. Then push that to the side. And then maybe you do maybe a starch.

So it's kind of a stair-step approach because when you do this straight those packs are just pure dextrose synthetic from corn syrup. They're just going to deplete a lot of B vitamins, B1, and that's going to affect your performance as well as deplete other things too. So you're taking this refined sugar. I think they even use maltodextrin. It's just so refined and it's going to be burned as fuel but it's going to come with a package because in order to burn that fuel, you need a lot of other nutrients. So at the very, very minimum, you should be taking B vitamins, electrolytes, not too many but just enough to compensate for that refined sugar that's going to deplete.

You can also take 50 mg of vitamin B6 3x a day to bring your mood right up and for breast tenderness, add iodine in the form of sea kelp.

**Where to get it**

If you want to get a vitamin B6 supplement, the wrong form would be pyridoxine hydrochloride (HCL). This is a synthetic version of vitamin B6 that has the potential to cause B6 deficiency symptoms. Pyridoxine HCL comes from petroleum, hydrochloric acid and formaldehyde.

The best natural forms of vitamin B6 are:

- Pyridoxine (not HCL)

- Pyridoxal phosphate

- Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate

**Food sources of vitamin B6**

• Chickpeas

## What Are The Primary Health Benefits Of Vitamin B9 Including Its Impac E06B1B

# What are the primary health benefits of Vitamin B9, including its impact on DNA synthesis, cell division, and prevention of neural tube defects during pregnancy?

Vitamin B9 is very important in many chemical reactions in the body.

There are a couple of different versions of vitamin B9: one is folic acid, and the other one is folate. Folic acid is the synthetic version, which is not recommended. Folate, on the other hand, is the natural version from folate-rich foods like vegetables or organ meats. If you’ve been wondering which is better, folate or folic acid, the better choice is folate.

**Benefits**

- Involved in many chemical reactions in the body, especially:

    - turning genes on and off

    - DNA repair

- Increased risk of cancer

- Heart disease

- Infertility

- Migraines

- Depression

- Inability to detoxify

- Problems with neurotransmitters

- Folic acid cons

You can have the problem of not getting enough of the natural vitamin B9 nutrient, but you may also be getting too much of the synthetic version. If you’re taking or being exposed to this synthetic version, you’re going to have a lot of additional problems. How might you be consuming folic acid without knowing?

- Grains are fortified with folic acid

- It may be included in synthetic vitamins or multi-vitamins

**How to consume it**

Consume foods rich in folate. If you have a supplement, follow the directions on the label for the proper dosage.

Also, if you are deficient in B9, consume the following:

- L-methylfolate

- B12 (take the methyl version, which is cobalamin)

**Where to get it**

You can get a supplement methyl version of folate at a health food store or order it online. Here is the list of food sources of folate:

## Which Vitamin Is Most Effective In Managing Migraines

# Which vitamin is most effective in managing migraines?

Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is particularly beneficial for managing migraines. It's important to note that over 50% of migraine cases have a genetic component, often related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria play a crucial role in energy production, and in individuals with migraines, these mitochondria may become dysfunctional, leading to hyper-excitable neurons.

Supplementing with riboflavin in higher doses, around 400 milligrams, has shown promising results for many individuals. Additionally, incorporating sea salt can be beneficial, as proper electrolyte balance is important.

Moreover, due to the oxidative stress associated with migraines, taking antioxidant-rich herbs such as ginger or turmeric may help mitigate free radical damage and provide further relief.

## How Does Caffeine Work On The Body

# How does caffeine work on the body?

Caffeine is known to give you energy but how does this happen? It blocks adenosine, which is a chemical that inhibits your central nervous system. It’s the breaks of your nervous system. It increases dopamine which let you temporarily handle depression, inability to manage stress, focus…etc.

Too much caffeine might increase artery stiffness down the road. It also depletes vitamin B1, calcium, and potassium. So too much is not okay, but you can do a small amount of it.

## What Are Some Quick Methods To Reduce Acid Reflux

# What are some quick methods to reduce acid reflux?

Heartburn is not a problem resulting from too much acid—it's a valve problem. Keeping the pH of the stomach between 1 and 3 keeps the valve shut.

**How to get rid of heartburn naturally:**

**1\. The most important nutrient to eliminate and prevent heartburn is vitamin B1 (thiamine).** Your stomach can not produce acid when you’re deficient in vitamin B1. A diet high in carbs depletes B1. Low B1 deprives the autonomic nervous system, which controls the valves of the stomach. Look for a natural source of vitamin B1 to get rid of heartburn.

**2\. Potassium and zinc are very important for your stomach acid.** Try a good electrolyte powder and trace mineral supplement to increase your intake of these important minerals. Also, make sure you’re getting plenty of sea salt.

**3\. Increase your stomach acid.** This triggers the valve at the top of the stomach to close. Apple cider vinegar and betaine hydrochloride can help acidify the stomach.

It’s important to note that if apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride causes burning, you may have gastritis or an ulcer. In this situation, you need to heal the stomach before taking apple cider vinegar or betaine hydrochloride.

## What Could Be The Reasons For Constantly Feeling Cold

# What could be the reasons for constantly feeling cold?

If you’re following a ketogenic diet and find yourself feeling cold, it may be beneficial to increase your intake of vitamin B1 (thiamine). B1 plays a role in temperature regulation and can help improve your tolerance to extreme temperatures. For example, if you struggle with ice bath therapy due to discomfort, this could indicate a deficiency in B1.

Similarly, if you find yourself overheating easily when exposed to sunlight, it may also suggest a B1 deficiency. Additionally, incorporating iodine from sources like sea kelp could be beneficial. Together, these two nutrients may support better thermal regulation.

**Where to get it**

- Almonds

- Eggs

- Onions

- Tomatoes

- Peanuts

- Salmon

- Romaine lettuce

- Cauliflower

Biotin supplement from a health food store

You can also consume probiotics in addition to biotin. The two together are a great remedy for hair loss.

## What Strategies And Interventions Are Most Effective For Improving Res 9A4C86

# What strategies and interventions are most effective for improving respiratory function and optimizing breathing efficiency?

There’s something called the respiratory quotient, which is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO2) that happens in your body. Fat has the lowest RQ at .7, meaning you’ll get the lowest amount of CO2 but the most amount of oxygen. This is why a lot of people report that they’re breathing better on the ketogenic diet, even if they have COPD, asthma, or emphysema. Plus, they can go longer when they exercise.

Depending on the amount of ketones in your body, the RQ may even be a little lower; potentially as low as .66 then ranging to .73. Protein has a slightly higher RQ at .8. But check this out: carbs are 1.0, meaning they give off the most amount of C02 and the least amount of oxygen.

Now, that being said, I want to bring up the concept of ketoacidosis.

When your body is in an acidic state, you have a difficult time breathing. More CO2 than oxygen is being produced, but for a different reason than I described earlier in this video. If you're concerned about ketoacidosis, I’ll define what it is.

Not only does the pH drop by a slight degree, but your blood glucose will be very high; on the order of 300 or more. When you’re on the ketogenic diet and you’re not a diabetic, your blood sugars are going to be more like 80, 70, 0r 60. In other words, quite low. You’d have to be a diabetic type 1 for it to be as high as it would be in ketoacidosis.

And this situation of extremely high blood sugar occurs when you have no insulin going on. So you’d have to be a type 1 diabetic, who hadn’t taken their insulin, for your blood glucose to get so out of control. Add in a very high level of ketones plus acidic blood, and the dangerous condition of ketoacidosis will result. So I just want to clear this up because sometimes people are confused and concerned that ketoacidosis is a common risk on keto. It’s not.

Another type of acidosis is lactic acidosis; which, ironically, is a side effect of the diabetes drug metformin. If you experience this, take vitamin B1 and calcium.

To summarize, the keto diet has the benefit of generating less CO2 and more oxygen to help you breathe better.

## What Are The Potential Underlying Causes Of Experiencing Numbness In T 4Ea3D1

# What are the potential underlying causes of experiencing numbness in the hands?

Myelin, crucial for nerve function, can be compromised by conditions like diabetes and thiamine deficiency, leading to symptoms such as numbness in hands and feet. Benfotiamine and dietary adjustments may help address thiamine deficiency.

Numbness in hands can also stem from vitamin B12 deficiency, which presents with symptoms like gait imbalance and spinal discomfort. Age-related low stomach acid can hinder B12 absorption, countered by betaine hydrochloride to boost acidity.

Low vitamin B12 may result from dietary insufficiency, antacids, metformin use, genetic factors, or digestive inflammation. Methylcobalamin supplementation, potentially with methylfolate and vitamin B6, is recommended for effective B12 intake and absorption, especially for those with genetic susceptibilities.

# What steps should I take if I continue to experience bloating despite using apple cider vinegar?

These are the symptoms of low stomach acid:

● Inability to absorb minerals, leading to a potential deficiency of iron, calcium, or any other minerals

● Decreased ability to absorb amino acids, which can show up as hair loss, loose skin, or incomplete digestion of protein, among other things

● Leaky gut, which can lead to allergies

● Bloating, abdominal pain, and acid reflux

● SIBO, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, when bacteria grow where they shouldn’t, in your small intestine, and whenever you consume fiber or probiotics it gets worse

● An infection in your lower digestive tract

● Constipation or diarrhea

● Sluggish gallbladder

You can take betaine hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar to improve stomach acid. Fasting also helps, as does drinking coffee. But so too does taking vitamin B3 (niacin). Common symptoms of B3 deficiency include anxiety, depression, fatigue, and skin problems, which the B3 you do have will address first, possibly preventing it from making more stomach acid. There’s a condition called B3 dependency, which may be caused by stress or certain microbes. When you’re stressed, your body oxidizes adrenaline and needs B3 to replenish it. And because tryptophan converts to B3, you need enough stomach acid to do so. As well, you need B3 to produce the energy called ATP from the mitochondria in your stomach cells. If you think you have low stomach acid, I recommend you take 50 to 100 milligrams of vitamin B3 per day, or more if you’re really stressed.

## What Benefits Might Come From Recognizing And Managing Delirium Given  Ce8B9A

# What benefits might come from recognizing and managing delirium, given its indication of underlying medical issues?

There are other causes of emotional instability that have nothing to do with nutrition as well. But, I want to talk about the nutrient connection to your emotions. I believe the best vitamin for emotional instability may be vitamin B1. 

If you’re deficient in vitamin B1, you could experience emotional instability and delirium. Delirium is mental confusion and emotional disruption. Delirium can also often occur when an alcoholic or drug addict is going through withdrawal symptoms. 

**There are certain specific parts of the brain that require B1:**

• The hippocampus 

• The Amygdala

• The mammillary bodies

The RDAs for vitamin B1 is only 2mg. Vitamin B1 is water-soluble, so you don’t store a lot of it. You’re body only needs a small amount of it, but it needs it consistently. You will need more vitamin B1 if you consume carbs. The more carbohydrates or sugar you consume, the more vitamin B1 you’ll need.

**Things that can deplete vitamin B1:**

• Glucose 

• Stress

• Chlorine 

• Refined foods

**Other vitamin B1 deficiency symptoms:**

1\. Irritability 

2\. Depression 

3\. Anxiety 

4\. Confusion

5\. Memory loss

6\. Lack of initiative 

7\. Poor learning 

8\. Poor concentration 

The best source of vitamin B1 is nutritional yeast. If you’re going to buy a vitamin B1 supplement, a natural version over a synthetic version may be the best way to go. But, unfortified or unenriched nutritional yeast should have enough vitamin B1.

## What Are The Various Causes Of Shortness Of Breath And How Do Factors  48073D

# What are the various causes of shortness of breath, and how do factors such as respiratory conditions, cardiovascular issues, and anxiety contribute to this symptom?

Shortness of breath means you can’t breathe well. Although some underlying disease can cause shortness of breath (dyspnea), diet and lifestyle choices may be at the root of this problem.

**Cause #1: Nutrient deficiencies**

Vitamins and minerals are essential for managing lung function, inflammation, muscle function, and heart activity. If you are deficient in vital nutrients, you can have a difficult time catching your breath. The main vitamin to pay attention to is B1. One of the main effects of a B1 deficiency is that you find you have breathing problems.

**Cause #2: pH imbalances**

A highly acidic body (acidosis) or a highly alkaline body (alkalosis) can cause you to feel out of breath or hungry for air. The solution is simple: normalize your pH (acidity-alkaline) level with the right diet.

## What Are The Underlying Causes Of Low Tolerance For Stress And How Do  822D10

# What are the underlying causes of low tolerance for stress, and how do psychological, environmental, and physiological factors contribute to this condition?

Low tolerance for stress is a condition where you can get an excessive reaction to things that normally wouldn’t cause so much reaction. You may get worried about little things or become easily irritated about them.

**Symptoms:**

- Worry/anxiety

- Nervous tension

- Being critical

- Excessive thinking at night

- Serious impact after bad news

**Cause #1: Adrenal fatigue**

Your adrenals are producing stress hormones to help you fight stressors from your environment. If the stress is constant, or chronic, this can wear out your adrenals-- making them unable to keep up with stress and unable to calm you down after it.

**Cause #2: Blood sugar fluctuations**

If you are on a high-carb diet, this can cause blood sugar fluctuations in your body. When your blood sugar goes high (after eating a high-carb meal) this can elevate your mood; however, shortly after you will feel irritated and can feel stressed out. This is because blood sugar will get lowered (to a point below the normal level) by insulin. Frequent eating, and refined carbs specifically, increase the production of insulin. Carbs in your diet will also deplete you of vitamin B1, which is an anti-stress vitamin.

## How Does Synthetic Vitamin B12 Compare To Its Natural Counterparts In  859608

# How does synthetic vitamin B12 compare to its natural counterparts in terms of efficacy and absorption?

Cyanocobalamin is a synthetic version of vitamin B12. It's a very cheap version, and it's hiding in many fortified grain foods, synthetic vitamins, energy drinks, B12 injections, and even infant formulas. It's also typically present in very high doses in these products. The problem is that there is a cyanide molecule attached to the cobalamin. Cyanide shuts down the oxygen to your mitochondria.

**Potential side effects of cyanocobalamin:**

• Vomiting

• Stomach problems

• Low potassium

• Headaches

• Fever

• Dizziness

The best form of vitamin B12 is the natural version called methylcobalamin. This version is the active form of vitamin B12 and stays in the body longer than the synthetic versions.

**Potential benefits of methylcobalamin:**

• It may help improve sleep

• It can decrease the need for sleep

• It can help you wake up feeling alert and refreshed

• It can help you fall asleep faster

• It's great for the nervous system (especially the myelin sheath)

• It supports healthy eyes

• It increases melatonin

• It decreases homocysteine

• It can help regulate cortisol

• It supports the red blood cells

## Can I Do Keto If I Have An Allergy To Nutritional Yeast And Nuts

# Can I do keto if I have an allergy to nutritional yeast and nuts?

For individuals with allergies to nutritional yeast and nuts, it is still possible to pursue a ketogenic diet, though careful consideration of food choices is necessary. For those looking to increase their intake of vitamin B1, sunflower seeds may serve as a suitable alternative, provided there are no allergies to them.

While some individuals experience sensitivities to nuts, soaking them in water for 24 hours and subsequently drying them in an oven or dehydrator may help reduce enzyme inhibitors, potentially enhancing their digestibility. However, for those who cannot consume nutritional yeast, this does limit their options for obtaining certain nutrients. It is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to tailor a ketogenic plan that accommodates dietary restrictions while ensuring adequate nutrient intake.

## What Are The Underlying Causes Of Heat Intolerance And How Do Physiolo 52F1C7

# What are the underlying causes of heat intolerance, and how do physiological, hormonal, and medical factors contribute to an individual’s inability to tolerate heat?

Heat intolerance is a condition where you feel overheated easily when you’re in a warm environment. This often includes excessive sweating, dizziness, or weakness.

**Cause 1: Lack of vitamin B1**

Heat intolerance roots in a vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. If you’re on a low-carb diet, you simply need to increase your vitamin B1 intake. If you’re on a high-carb diet, carbs and sugar can deplete B vitamins, especially B1.

## What Are The Physiological Advantages Of Hydrochloric Acid In Gastric  73E4E4

# What are the physiological advantages of hydrochloric acid in gastric function and overall digestive health?

HCL is the most important fluid inside our body and without this acid in the stomach, our body will have a lot of problems.

The stomach acid needs to be very strong (acidic) preferably in the range of 1-3. If the stomach is less acidic it will not release pepsin (which is an enzyme for chemical reactions and is responsible for the breakdown of proteins).

**3 Major Health Benefits of Hydrochloric Acid**

1\. To help breakdown proteins

2\. Absorb minerals

3\. Kill microbes

Junk food, stress, antiacids, diarrhea, and vomiting can cause low stomach acid. And as we age, we lose our stomach acids, in fact, by age 70, we have only 25% of our stomach acids left.

**Low Stomach Acids Can Trigger:**

• Gas

• Indigestion

• Bloating

• Iron deficiency (anemia)

• Soft tissue calcium build-up

• Low B12

• Constipation

• Red cheeks

• SIBO (small intestine bacterial overgrowth)

• Leaky Gut

## What Are The Most Effective Interventions For Managing And Reducing El 77Cac3

# What are the most effective interventions for managing and reducing elevated cortisol levels?

Cortisol is a vital hormone—you need small amounts of it to stay healthy. However, when you have way too much cortisol, you can run into many issues when it comes to your health and body weight. Cortisol is a stress hormone that can add pounds to your belly fat.

Here are six ways to help regulate your cortisol levels.

1\. Lower your body stress levels - Stress accumulates in your body. If you don’t release it, it continues to build up and cause issues throughout your body. Acupressure is a great way to get rid of stress in your body.

2\. Increase your sleep - You need to address both the quality and quantity of your sleep. Stress levels, sleep disorders, and insulin resistance can lead to poor sleep.

3\. Increase your aerobic exercise - Aerobic exercise is great for lowering stress and cortisol. Long walks are great for lowering cortisol.

4\. Take vitamins B1, B5, and D - These nutrients are vital for managing health cortisol and stress levels.

5\. Use adaptogens (herbs) - Adaptogenic herbs can help increase your resistance to stress, thus helping support healthy cortisol levels.

6\. Increase potassium and magnesium intake - These nutrients help activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which lowers the fight-or-flight stress response.

## What Are The Health Benefits And Nutritional Advantages Of Incorporati 7E4B14

# What are the health benefits and nutritional advantages of incorporating lemon into the diet?

Lemon is a fruit that has many different benefits for our bodies. It contains citric acid, which is a very strong type of acid. One interesting thing about lemon juice is that as soon as you consume it, it gets burned up in the body and turns alkaline.

It should be noted that it can help prevent uric acid stones, as well as help with acidosis. Lemon juice won’t alkalize the blood or body, but it will alkalize the urine.

**Benefits**

- May help decrease the risk of kidney stones

- High in vitamin C

- Helps with acidosis

- Can help reduce the risk of gout

- Has the highest concentrates of citrates of any food

- Helps to alkalize the body

- Low in fructose

**How to consume it**

If you’re doing fasting or keto, mix some lemon (about 1 oz) in water and drink that to help minimize acidosis and some of the symptoms of it.

You can also consume lemon juice. Make sure it is organic and not pasteurized—also that it doesn’t contain sugar.

## What Are The Therapeutic Benefits Of Inositol In The Management Of Pol C29Db8

# What are the therapeutic benefits of inositol in the management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)?

PCOS occurs when the androgen male sex hormones are too high in a women’s body. Symptoms include growing facial hair, developing belly fat, and hair loss on your head. You might get a deeper voice.

High levels of androgen are caused by high levels of insulin. So of course you want to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to lower your insulin levels. But there’s a little more to it.

There’s a vitamin called inositol that’s part of the vitamin B family. Interestingly, if you suck on it, it tastes sweet. Inositol is involved in sugar metabolism. Inositol is actually nine different vitamin B compounds, Two of the nine versions are called MYO and D-chiro. I and others believe that in women with PCOS, the MYO doesn’t convert to the d-chiro. So on top of the high levels of insulin and androgens, this contributes to the problem.

When you give women with PCOS a 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, their symptoms improve, as does their fertility, weight loss, acne, and the quality of their eggs. Find an inositol supplement that has this 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, to further enhance the benefits of keto and intermittent fasting. Inositol alone won’t completely help. You’ve got to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to get your insulin levels low enough to stop driving up your androgen levels.

## What Effective Strategies And Approaches Can Be Employed To Address Fe E6520A

# What effective strategies and approaches can be employed to address feelings of weakness?

Weakness in simple words means lack of energy. Additional symptoms of weakness can include fatigue, feeling tired, etc. If you have any of the above symptoms, let’s find and remedy the most common causes for weakness.

**Cause 1: High-carb diet**

When you are on a high-carb diet you may often feel weak and tired. The reason behind this is that when you consume carbs, your blood sugar goes high. Although you may feel energetic, the feeling will go away very fast. Your body will produce insulin, which in its turn will lower the blood sugar, causing you to crave food and feel weak.

Additionally, consuming sugar in general will instantly make your body weaker! You can watch this video and try the experiment.

**Cause 2: Stress**

If you have chronic stress, it can wear your body out. Lack of sleep or vitamin B1 deficiency can lead to poor tolerance of stress and the inability of stress-regulating organs to work properly. These can definitely cause weakness.

## What Are The Symptoms Associated With Subclinical Scurvy And How Do Th 6B539D

# What are the symptoms associated with subclinical scurvy, and how do they differ from those of more advanced vitamin C deficiency?

Scurvy is a severe vitamin C deficiency. When it’s classified as subclinical, that means it doesn't show up on a typical blood test because it’s still developing. Another term for this is latent scurvy.

**Here are some of the symptoms of scurvy:**

•Capillary damage

•Fatigue

•Bleeding gums

•Weakness

•Irritability

•Leg pain

•Inflammation

•Achy joints and muscles

Your vascular system is most susceptible to vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C keeps the collagen in your arteries strong and elastic. Without enough vitamin C, your arteries can develop lesions and lose their vascular integrity. Capillary damage occurs when you have high levels of sugar in your blood. Sugar competes with the vitamin C in your body, causing vitamin C levels to drop. When you have capillary damage, arterial bleeding, and inflammation, your body sends cholesterol and calcium to repair the damage.

This can also happen in your skin, resulting in rosacea. You can also develop bleeding gums, a nosebleed, or experience damage to your nerves. In addition to vitamin C, vitamin B1(thiamine) can help protect your body from high levels of sugar in your blood.

## What Are The Benefits Of Niacin And How To Fix Niacin Deficiency

# What are the benefits of Niacin and how to fix Niacin deficiency?

**Benefits of Niacin:** Niacin is a precursor to NAD, which helps extract electrons from foods. This allows you to get more energy from the food that you eat. Vitamin B3 helps support something known as sirtuins, which support longevity and DNA repair. L-tryptophan can convert to niacin, serotonin, and melatonin! Niacin is very beneficial for skin health and conditions like acne and psoriasis. A niacin deficiency can cause very dry, scaly skin. The form of niacin known as niacinamide can help with inflammatory conditions like arthritis. Niacin also supports healthy levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol. It was very popular before the development of statins.

**Where to get it:** Animal protein and organ meats are the best sources of niacin. You can also get niacin from spirulina and nutritional yeast, but look for nutritional yeast that does not have added synthetic vitamins. There is a tremendous amount of research on niacin and cholesterol, the heart, and mood disorders like schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder.

## What Nutritional Deficiencies Are Most Commonly Associated With Consti D37E50

# What nutritional deficiencies are most commonly associated with constipation, and how do they affect digestive health?

The #1 nutritional deficiency behind constipation: a vitamin B1 deficiency. A severe vitamin B1 deficiency is called beriberi.

Constipation is essentially a problem with peristalsis—it’s not working properly, and you’re not pumping waste through the body. The autonomic nervous system is intimately involved with the gut. When you don’t have enough vitamin B1 (thiamine), a lot of things can go wrong with the autonomic nervous system—which then affects the gut.

## What Are The Primary Factors And Underlying Conditions That Contribute E9B9Ec

# What are the primary factors and underlying conditions that contribute to the development of restless leg syndrome?

Restless leg syndrome is very uncomfortable and keeps you from sleeping. You have an impulse to fidget, and you feel like you can’t be still. 

A deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine) causes restless leg syndrome. Refined carbs and sugar can cause a vitamin B1 deficiency. The best source of natural vitamin B1 is nutritional yeast.

## What Are Some Healthy Foods I Need In My Diet

# What are some healthy foods I need in my diet?

Food is defined as that which is eaten to sustain life, provide energy, and promote the growth and repair of tissues.

By this definition, everything we eat should not be defined as food! Ultra-processed foods do not sustain life, provide energy, or promote the growth of tissues. Ultra-processed foods, also known as junk foods, create the most disease.

Ultra-processed foods can be described as foods that have been altered in an extreme way, either chemically, mechanically, or with heat. These “foods” should be completely eliminated from the diet. Foods like Doritos are packed full of chemically altered GMO ingredients. They contain large amounts of unsaturated fatty acids and are shelf-stable for long periods of time.

Ultra-processed foods often contain three main ingredients: synthetic sugars, synthetic starches, and synthetic seed oils. Avoid these ingredients.

**Here are the 8 healthiest foods:**

1\. Red meat–Grass-fed, grass-finished beef is excellent for your health and is one of the highest sources of glutamine.

2\. Wild-caught fatty fish–Salmon and other fatty fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids.

3\. Shellfish–Shrimp, clams, mussels, and other shellfish contain omega-3s, but they’re also a rich source of trace minerals. Oysters are one of the best sources of zinc.

4\. Eggs–Choose organic pasture-raised eggs.

5\. Fermented vegetables–Sauerkraut and kimchi are excellent sources of probiotics and vitamin C.

6\. Leafy greens–Arugula, spinach, and high-quality lettuce contain folate, vitamin C, magnesium, and potassium. Consuming dairy with spinach can reduce oxalates.

7\. Organ meats–Beef liver, cod liver, and other organ meats are rich in many vitamins, minerals, and trace minerals.

8\. Herbs and spices–Garlic, onion, sage, thyme, sea salt, basil, and cinnamon all have unique properties and important health benefits.

## What Are The Key Signs And Symptoms Associated With Thiamine Deficiency

# What are the key signs and symptoms associated with thiamine deficiency?

Vitamin B1, crucial for mitochondrial function, is vital for energy production. Deficiency symptoms include low energy, influenced by carbohydrate and sugar consumption since B1 is necessary for glucose metabolism. It's water-soluble and not stored long-term, increasing risk of deficiency.

B1 also supports the myelin sheath and autonomic nervous system, impacting conditions like gastroparesis, GERD, and peripheral neuropathy. Symptoms range from irregular sweating and tears to dizziness, irritability, and increased pulse rate.

Severe deficiencies may lead to enlarged heart, edema, confusion, memory loss, and other neurological issues like nystagmus and ataxia, highlighting B1's critical role in overall health.

## Is Cassava Safe To Consume On Keto

# Is cassava safe to consume on Keto?

Can you have cassava chips on keto? Cassava is very high in carbohydrates. It’s also very high on the glycemic index. Cassava is a starch—it’s a root vegetable. Cassava is also used to make tapioca. Tapioca is not keto-friendly. Another name for cassava is yuca. Cassava or yuca is not keto-friendly.

Cassava also contains very small amounts of vitamin B1 (thiamine). This is a problem because anytime you have something with a lot of carbs and low vitamin B1, you can create a vitamin B1 deficiency. This happens because it takes vitamin B1 to metabolize carbs.

## Should I Do Juicing While On Keto Or While Fasting

# Should I do juicing while on Keto or while fasting?

In general, I do not think that juicing is the best idea on keto or while fasting—unless you’re doing a juice powder. Why? Because many vegetable juices can contain more carbs than you would expect. In turn, this can low down ketosis and weight loss.

When calculating the carbs in a vegetable, you want to subtract the fiber from the total carbs, which will give you the net carbs. Juicing removes the fiber from the vegetables, which means you can no longer subtract it from the total carbs. One cup of juice will have more net carbs than one cup of whole vegetable because of the fiber content.

Additionally, juicing can remove a lot of the phytonutrients in vegetables. Phytonutrients have powerful health benefits. If you find it difficult not to have juice because of cravings, try using inositol. This is a form of natural sugar alcohol (known as vitamin B8) that helps with insulin resistance. If you can repair insulin resistance, you will have a much easier time fighting off cravings.

Bile salts can also help reduce cravings. Bile helps you break down and absorb healthy fats that keep you feeling satisfied after eating.

## What Are The Underlying Factors That May Contribute To A Childs Overwe 83Cb6A

# What are the underlying factors that may contribute to a child's overweight status?

**Consuming too many carbohydrates might be number two, but the number one reason is snacking.** 

The problem with snacking is that you have various hormones that are secreted in your stomach and small intestine that will stimulate insulin after you eat. Snacking in-between the meals could keep insulin high. Insulin actually prevents the loss of fat, as well as causes the storage of fat. 

**The most common snacks kids are fed:**

1\. Flavored yogurt—3.5oz has about 13g of sugar

2\. Popcorn—very high on the glycemic index

3\. Applesauce—very high on the glycemic index

4\. Energy bar—a granola bar could have 19g of net carbs 

5\. Juice—very high on the glycemic index

6\. Crackers and peanut butter—can be very high on the glycemic index

7\. Apples—on average contain around 19g of sugar 

**What you could do:**

• Don’t keep any snacks that are high in carbohydrates in the house.

• Make a transition to no snacking using healthier snacks first. 

• Ideally, don’t give the child any snacks. Give them 3 nutrient-dense meals, with enough calories and healthy fats.

## What Are Some Effective Methods For Increasing Oxygen Levels In The Body

# What are some effective methods for increasing oxygen levels in the body?

VO2 max is the volume of oxygen your body can consume over a certain amount of time. You can get this test from doctors who specialize in sports medicine.

To increase your VO2 max, you need to consider two things:

1\. CO2 - CO2 allows oxygen to go deep into the tissues.

2\. Lactic acid - Built-up lactic acid affects your pH and muscles, making breathing and exercising more difficult. Top athletes with efficient mitochondria, who have increased their capacity to absorb oxygen and get rid of lactic acid, have bulletproofed themselves against disease. They also have high VO2 max scores. This makes the VO2 max test a good measurement to help evaluate your overall health. The best ways to increase VO2 max, and therefore, longevity: 1. Exercise • Do HIIT (high-intensity interval training) 2. Increase CO2 tolerance • Practice nasal breathing • Practice holding your breath

3\. Increase your lactic acid tolerance • Do HIIT • Get plenty of thiamine (vitamin B1) • Avoid sugar

4\. Hypoxic training • Restrict air while exercising or exercise at high altitudes

5\. Respiratory muscle training • Try inspiratory muscle training and expiratory muscle training

6\. Plyometric training • Try explosive short bursts of exercise

7\. Fartlek training • Try speeding up and slowing down your pace sporadically while running

8\. Cross-training • Combine different exercises in one workout

9\. Sleep • Sleep eight or nine hours a night

10\. Don’t overtrain • Get plenty of recovery between workouts

11\. A healthy diet • Get on the Healthy Keto® diet • Do intermittent fasting

## What Are The Underlying Causes Of Air Hunger

# What are the underlying causes of air hunger?

When traditional causes like asthma, pneumonia, COPD, or heart conditions are ruled out, persistent difficulty breathing (pseudo-dyspnea) may persist. Here are some natural remedies for specific underlying causes:

1\. **Silent reflux**: Consider chlorophyll, wheatgrass juice powder, betaine hydrochloride (if tolerated), and diluted apple cider vinegar consumed through a straw (if no gut or esophageal irritation).

2\. **Alkalosis**: Address with betaine hydrochloride (if tolerated), diluted apple cider vinegar, Healthy Keto® diet, intermittent fasting, and TUDCA supplementation.

3\. **Costochondritis**: Try massaging and stretching the spine, and using a mobility stick for relief.

4\. **COVID**: Consider thiamine (vitamin B1) for potential respiratory support.

These natural approaches aim to alleviate symptoms and address underlying causes of pseudo-dyspnea effectively.

## What Are The Potential Health Risks Associated With The Presence Of Gl D19B13

# What are the potential health risks associated with the presence of glucose in urine?

It means that your blood sugars or the glucose in your blood are minimally at 225 or more – this is one of the ways that the body is trying to get rid of the toxic glucose by peeing it out and it is called Osmotic Diuresis.

The complication of having this is it pulls out minerals specifically potassium, sodium, chloride, and more that cause dehydration.

**Low Minerals Symptoms:**

• Headache

• Fatigue

• Confusion

• Purple nails

## What Mechanisms Explain How The Consumption Of Sugar Can Lead To A Dep 0B8458

# What mechanisms explain how the consumption of sugar can lead to a depletion of vitamin B1 in the body?

Vitamin B1 is necessary for the breakdown of carbohydrates. This process is known as carbohydrate catabolism.

So the more carbohydrates that you consume, the more your body needs vitamin B1 for the metabolism of carbs.

When you’re eating a large number of carbs, your vitamin B1 intake often can’t keep up.

The best natural source of vitamin B1 is nutritional yeast. In summary, vitamin B1 is a crucial nutrient. It’s important to replenish your vitamin B1 and avoid high-carb diets.

## Is Alkaline Water Safe To Consume

# Is alkaline water safe to consume?

Natural water from a well or spring is alkaline. It’s alkaline because it contains minerals like calcium and magnesium. Many people believe that things that are acidic are unhealthy and things that are alkaline are healthy. But that’s not altogether true. We have a lot of different acids in our bodies that have many important functions.

We don’t need to worry about alkalizing the body. The body regulates the pH in different areas. For example, your blood should be slightly alkaline, but your stomach should be very acidic. It’s possible to get alkaline water created by a machine that uses electricity to alter it instead of using minerals to alkalize it. If you drink alkaline water that's created artificially, you’re going to alter the pH in the stomach.

**Potential side effects of alkaline water made artificially can include:**

• Heartburn

• Acid reflux

• Gas

• GERD

• Infection

• Hair loss

• Heart arrhythmias

However, natural water, like alkaline spring water, has no side effects. Alkalizing the stomach could lead to a deficiency in stomach acids. The stomach should be very acidic to help you break down protein, absorb minerals and vitamin B12, and kill pathogens. As we age, we lose stomach acid.
Antacids also weaken stomach acid. But, low stomach acid is the root cause of symptoms like heartburn, GERD, and acid reflux. Alkalizing the stomach instead of acidifying it could worsen these symptoms and lead to many other serious side effects. I’ve found that I can digest better when I drink acidic water, like carbonated water—especially if I add a teaspoon of either apple cider vinegar or lemon juice. Overall, alkaline water has certain health benefits because it contains minerals. But alkaline water is only beneficial if it’s natural and not created by a machine.

## What Chemicals Are Gras Generally Recognized As Safe And Are They Actu B8Fb6A

# What chemicals are GRAS (generally recognized as safe) and are they actually safe??

Six chemicals that are generally recognized as safe: 

1\. Nitrates:  • Help preserve meat  • Increase shelf life  • Increase the risk of cancer  • Could be in your drinking water 

2\. BHA: • A preservative  • An endocrine disruptor  • A carcinogen 

3\. BHT:  • A preservative  • An endocrine disruptor  • Toxic to the liver and kidneys  • Increases cancer risk 

4\. Potassium bromide:  • A dough conditioner used in many flour products  • A carcinogen  • Can inhibit iodine 

5\. Brominated vegetable oil: • A flavor stabilizer in beverages  • A flame retardant  • Can harm the nervous system and brain  • Can affect your memory  • Can interfere with iodine 

6\. Titanium dioxide  • Gives candy a smooth texture and brightens colors  • Can cause DNA damage  • Increases cancer risk  • A heavy metal 

Our bodies have the ability to get rid of a lot of these poisons if we don’t consume too many.  However, some people have a problem with their detoxification genes. This means that they have a lessened ability to get rid of these poisons.  The best thing to do is to try to avoid these chemicals and consume foods that support the detoxification process, like cruciferous vegetables.

## What Nutritional Deficiencies Are Associated With Sleep Apnea

# What nutritional deficiencies are associated with sleep apnea?

This is a condition that affects sleep. The root cause of this is high glucose which then depletes vitamin B1 and could affect the function of your breathing.

Vitamin B1 is essential in maintaining the normal function of the brain stem especially for your breathing centers which connect to the nerve called the phrenic nerve. This nerve controls the entire diaphragm, its motor control, and movement.

I recommend taking B1 (100-500mg) with a natural blend of Bs from nutritional yeast (unfortified).

**Symptoms of Low Vitamin B1:**

• Lactic Acidosis – pH becomes slightly more acidic.

• Dyspnea – It is the difficulty of breathing that is related to something called Beri Beri.

• SIDS – (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) which is related to a severe B1 deficiency in an infant.

## What Are The Common Causes Of Bloodshot Eyes

# What are the common causes of bloodshot eyes?

Interestingly, vitamin B2 deficiency can cause your eyes to look bloodshot.

Low vitamin B2 can cause other symptoms related to your eyes, including itchy eyes, watery eyes, and light sensitivity.

**Aside from your eyes, a vitamin B2 deficiency may also cause symptoms such as:**

• Cracked or chapped lips

• Cracked corners of your mouth

• Oily nose

• Red tongue

• Migraines

The question is, what causes low vitamin B2? A vitamin B2 deficiency isn’t usually caused by not consuming enough foods with vitamin B2. Instead, it’s typically caused by a malabsorption situation.

There are two primary causes of poor vitamin B2 absorption. Inflammation in the digestive system can cause absorption issues, and refined carbohydrates can cause poor absorption. Bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, pancakes, waffles, biscuits, and all other refined carbohydrate products are very destructive to your digestive system. Avoid these at all costs.

## Can I Use Inositol For Pcos

# Can I use inositol for PCOS?

PCOS occurs when the androgen male sex hormones are too high in a women’s body. Symptoms include growing facial hair, developing belly fat, and hair loss on your head. You might get a deeper voice.

High levels of androgen are caused by high levels of insulin. So of course you want to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to lower your insulin levels. But there’s a little more to it.

There’s a vitamin called inositol that’s part of the vitamin B family. Interestingly, if you suck on it, it tastes sweet. Inositol is involved in sugar metabolism. Inositol is actually nine different vitamin B compounds, Two of the nine versions are called MYO and D-chiro. I and others believe that in women with PCOS, the MYO doesn’t convert to the d-chiro. So on top of the high levels of insulin and androgens, this contributes to the problem.

When you give women with PCOS a 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, their symptoms improve, as does their fertility, weight loss, acne, and the quality of their eggs. Find an inositol supplement that has this 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, to further enhance the benefits of keto and intermittent fasting. Inositol alone won’t completely help. You’ve got to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to get your insulin levels low enough to stop driving up your androgen levels.

## Is It Advisable To Follow A Ketogenic Diet With Hypoglycemia

# Is it advisable to follow a ketogenic diet with hypoglycemia?

Low blood sugar comes from high blood sugar and the spike of insulin pushing it down – hypoglycemia is high insulin.

**Don’t we need sugar to balance it?**

• The actual cause of hypoglycemia is high insulin so adding more sugar to balance, it raises more insulin. Insulin resistance is also caused by too much insulin. When you have insulin resistance, the body is making 7x the amount of insulin that you need compared to a normal person.

**How to keep insulin normal?**

• Keep sugars low.

• Don’t do frequent meals.

• Consume Magnesium + Potassium + Vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast)

## How Long Does It Typically Take To Reverse Fatty Liver Disease

# How long does it typically take to reverse fatty liver disease?

To effectively alleviate fatty liver symptoms, consider these key strategies:

1\. **Healthy Keto Diet**: A low-carb, low-sugar approach like Healthy Keto, emphasizing vegetables and moderate protein, can significantly benefit fatty liver conditions.

2\. **Intermittent Fasting**: Adopting intermittent fasting, gradually extending fasting periods to promote liver healing and enter autophagy, a state where damaged proteins are repaired.

3\. **Choline Supplementation**: Incorporate choline-rich foods or supplements like vitamin B complex with nutritional yeast to support liver function and aid in fat metabolism.

4\. **Cruciferous Vegetables**: Increase intake of organic cruciferous vegetables and fermented foods to enhance gut health, which is linked to liver health improvement.

These remedies can help mitigate fatty liver symptoms over time, depending on the chronicity and extent of liver damage and the consistency of dietary improvements.

## What Are The Therapeutic Benefits Of Laxatives

# What are the therapeutic benefits of laxatives?

Laxatives are herbs and medicines that produce bowel movements and relieve constipation. People often say they don’t want to take a laxative because they may be addictive (after taking them regularly for some time, your colon muscles lose strength and can become dependent on them). But the toxic effect of having chronic constipation can be very dangerous to the body compared to the minor side effects of taking a laxative.

**Side effects**

In addition to the colon developing an addiction to laxatives, you might experience a small drop in potassium from taking a laxative, but you can easily take more potassium to replenish it. Ultimately, you want to correct what’s really causing the constipation, which usually is either the food you’re eating or a lack of friendly bacteria.

**Laxatives can have these side effects:**

- They can be addictive

They can deplete electrolytes, like potassium (in this case, you would want to add the electrolytes back)

**How to consume them**

If you have constipation, as a coping mechanism take a herbal natural laxative like cascara sagrada. This should give you constipation relief while you figure out what’s really causing the condition.

**Where to get them**

Here is a list of the best natural laxatives:

- Senna

- Cascara sagrada

- Black psyllium (swells with water)

- Castor oil

- Magnesium

- Fermented vegetables

- Probiotics

- MCT oil

- Bile salts

- Vitamin B1

- Probiotics

- Fasting

Excess androgens, male sex hormones present in both men and women, lead to symptoms like facial hair, hair loss, and PCOS in women, and hair loss and prostate issues in men.

**Causes and Remedies:**

1\. **Conversion to DHT:**

Enzymes convert testosterone to DHT, exacerbating symptoms:

\- Use spearmint tea, red reishi mushroom, licorice, green tea, black cohosh, chaste tree, and DIM supplements.

2\. **Estrogen Conversion Blockage:**

Glyphosate in non-organic foods inhibits enzyme activity:

\- Avoid GMOs and choose organic foods.

3\. **High Insulin:**

Refined carbs and sugar spike insulin, increasing androgens:

\- Avoid refined carbs, sugar, and snacking; follow Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting.

4\. **High Stress:**

Stress boosts adrenal androgen production:

\- Take vitamin B1, manage stress, improve sleep, and take walks.

\- Supplement with calcium, potassium, and magnesium.

\- Consider adrenal support supplements.

These steps help regulate androgen levels, alleviating associated symptoms and supporting overall health.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of High Blood Potassium Levels

# What are the potential causes of high blood potassium levels?

**Hyperkalemia Overview:**

**Definition:** Excess potassium in the body, rare but serious.

**Symptoms (severe cases):**

\- Palpitations

\- Tiredness

\- Numbness

\- Abnormal heart rate

\- Shortness of breath

\- Muscle pain/weakness

**Causes and Remedies:**

1\. **Addison’s Disease:**

\- **Cause:** Autoimmune adrenal gland condition, leading to salt loss.

\- **Remedies:** Avoid potassium-rich foods, use sea salt, supplement with vitamin B1, manage stress, consider Panax ginseng.

2\. **Advanced Kidney Disease:**

\- **Cause:** Reduced kidney function impairs potassium removal.

\- **Remedies:** Limit potassium-rich vegetables, use sea salt, monitor potassium intake, consider astragalus and citrates.

**Other Causes:**

\- Medications like NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, potassium-sparing diuretics.

These steps help maintain potassium balance and support kidney and adrenal health effectively.

## What Are The Common Causes Of Low Blood Pressure

# What are the common causes of low blood pressure?

Low blood pressure can cause a lot of problems if the causes are unknown and only symptoms are treated. Let’s take a look at common reasons behind it.

**Cause #1: Postural hypotension (POTS)**

Postural hypotension (or POTS) is a condition where, if you stand up too fast, you feel dizzy. This condition is linked to the low blood sugar that can result when your stress-regulating glands (adrenals) are worn out or you are deficient in vitamin B1. When weak adrenals or deficiency in B1 bring about low blood sugar, it can show up as POTS.

**Remedies:**

- Take vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

- Avoid refined carbs and sugar (they deplete you of vitamin B1)

- Avoid alcohol (depletes you of vitamin B1)

- Support your adrenals by doing the following:

    - improve sleep (take naps if needed)

    - regularly exercise (don’t overtrain)

    - take long walks outside (at least 45 minutes)

    - take magnesium

- take potassium

- You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support

- You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Cause #2: Dehydration**

If you don’t consume enough fluid in your diet this can result in dehydration of your body and, as a result, low blood pressure. Dehydration can be caused by vomiting, diarrhea, diuretics, not drinking enough fluid or lack of electrolytes (especially salt and potassium). Salt is very important for your body to be able to retain fluid, so make sure you are not deficient in it.

**Remedies:**

- Drink more fluids

- Take electrolytes high in potassium

- Consume more Himalayan sea salt

- Consume more vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)

- Avoid diuretics

**Other causes:**

- Medication (diuretics, antidepressants, HBP meds)

- Addison’s disease

- Iron deficiency (anemia)

- B12 and folate deficiency

- After eating your blood pressure can go low

## What Are The Potential Reasons For Shortness Of Breath When Climbing Stairs

# What are the potential reasons for shortness of breath when climbing stairs?

If you are out of breath when climbing stairs this could be due to several reasons. Although an underlying disease can cause shortness of breath after climbing stairs, diet and lifestyle choices can also be at the root of this problem.

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiencies**

Vitamins and minerals are essential for managing lung function, inflammation, muscle function, and heart activity. If you are deficient in vital nutrients, you can have a difficult time catching your breath. The main vitamin to pay attention to is B1. One of the main effects of a B1 deficiency is that you find you have breathing problems.

**Cause #2: pH imbalances**

A highly acidic body (acidosis) or a highly alkaline body (alkalosis) can cause you to feel out of breath or hungry for air. The solution is simple: normalize your pH level with the right diet.

## What Are The Most Important Benefits Of Betaine Hydrochloride

# What are the most important benefits of betaine hydrochloride?

Betaine hydrochloride is an acidic vitamin-like amino acid that has excellent benefits for your digestive tract. It is found naturally in certain foods like beets, spinach, beef and shrimp. It increases your stomach acidity (lowers your stomach’s pH).

One of the functions of strong acid is to prevent pathogens from moving from the stomach into your small intestine and then multiplying out of control. Your stomach acidity should be between 1.5 and 3, which is highly acidic. Betaine hydrochloride is a great remedy for increasing stomach acidity, which will help with the absorption of all the other nutrients in your diet.

**Benefits:**

- Acidifies your stomach

- Helps with alkalosis

- Natural remedy for SIBO

- Helps absorb the following nutrients:

- proteins

- minerals

- trace minerals

- vitamins

## What Are The Possible Causes Of Nail Problems

# What are the possible causes of nail problems?

Typically, your urine should be a straw yellow color. If it is different it may have different causes under different colors of it.

Horizontal ridges / Too-white nails / Too-blue nails

This could happen from vitamin B1 deficiency. Additionally if your nails are too white, it could come from the same cause. Avoiding refined carbohydrates, consuming benfotiamine (fat- soluble vitamin B1) as well as nutritional yeast should help.

Brittle nails

Brittle nails can happen due to the deficiency of biotin (vitamin H) and folate. Consuming too much refined foods as well as egg whites only can cause its deficiency. Consuming probiotics and fermented foods should help. One good source of biotin is nutritional yeast. You can get folate as a supplement as well.

White little spots on the nail

If you see a white spec in the middle of the nail it means 3 months ago you had zinc deficiency that created it. The reason behind this timing is because your nails take 6 months to fully grow. Therefore, you can trace it this way. Too much sugar and refined carbs can cause zinc deficiency.

Additionally, if you have horizontal white lines this can come from low calcium or vitamin B3 deficiency.

Too-brown / too-gray nails or pink strips on top of the nails

This is a symptom of B12 deficiency. B12 mainly comes from animal products so if you are vegan it can potentially create B12 Deficiency. Consuming animal products / B12 supplements as well as increasing stomach acidity should help.

Vertical ridges on the nails

This is a symptom of thyroid problem as well as vitamin B12 and iron deficiency. Consuming Organic sea kelp should help with that in addition to nutritional yeast.

Clubbed nails
This could potentially come from liver or kidney problems.
Yellowish discoloration on your nail
This is a symptom of fungus on your nails. Consuming biotin should help with that.

## What Are The Possible Reasons For Insufficient Muscle Growth

# What are the possible reasons for insufficient muscle growth?

Lack of muscle growth can have several underlying reasons; however it has simple and effective remedies.

**Cause #1: Lack of workout intensity**

To be able to have muscle growth you have to do higher weights and lower reps. This is because your muscle tissues need to be damaged from the exercise for your body to heal them and make them bigger. Make sure your technique is correct to avoid injuries and gradually increase the intensity.

**Remedies:**

- Hire a personal trainer to help you with the workouts and technique

- Put enough weights so you can barely do 5 to 7 reps (make sure you gradually increase the weights)

- Do more compound exercises that affect several muscles:

deadlifts

squats

overhead push

power clean

**Cause #2: Lack of recovery**

Your muscles grow when you sleep. This is because after the exercises your body has to heal the damaged muscle tissues and grow them. If you have high-intensity exercises and you eat correctly but don’t recover this can definitely cause inability to gain muscle mass. The best way is to improve your recovery.

Additionally, if you undergo high amounts of stress, this will cause your body to produce too much cortisol (stress-regulating hormone). Cortisol could break down your muscle tissues and turn them into blood sugar.

**Remedies:**

- Sleep 8 to 9 hrs per day (take naps if needed)

- Let your muscles recover fully before training the same muscles again

- Consume potassium (4,700 mg / day)

- Consume more vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast

• benfotiamine

- Avoid things and people that stress you out

- Take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes).

**Cause #3: Low amounts of human growth hormone and testosterone**

There are two main hormones that help us grow and retain muscles. These are testosterone and human growth hormone. If you lack these hormones it can result in muscle loss and inability to grow it.

Human growth hormone (HGH) is an anti-aging hormone. It burns fat as well as building muscles and regenerating the body. The best way to increase HGH is to do intermittent fasting and high-intensity full body training.

Testosterone is a male hormone that is also needed for women in smaller amounts. Having normal amounts of testosterone in addition to exercises can build your muscles. One way to improve testosterone is by avoiding things that cause it to go low.

**Remedies:**

- Increase human growth hormone by doing these things:

    - do intermittent fasting

    - consume 7 to 8 oz of protein per meal

    - improve sleep

- Increase testosterone by doing the following:

    - consume more cholesterol (helps to make testosterone)

    - consume moderate amounts of protein (6 to 8 oz in meal)

    - consume zinc (100 mg / day)

- consume korean red ginseng

- take L-arginine

- take D-aspartic acid

- consume cruciferous vegetables (natural estrogen blockers)

- consume DIM (concentrated cruciferous)

- consume white button mushrooms

- consume mushrooms in general

- consume celery

- consume parsley

- consume olive oil

**Cause #4: Insulin resistance**

Consuming a lot of refined carbs and sugars will spike your insulin high in order to lower the blood sugar level that results. Eventually your cells become resistant to insulin. The connection between insulin resistance and lack of muscle growth requires an understanding of insulin.

Insulin acts like a key to the cells, allowing them to absorb vital nutrients. If your cells are resistant to insulin they don’t absorb protein well, causing slow muscle growth or inability to grow muscle.

If you do the Healthy Keto® diet as well as an intermittent fasting plan your body cells will be less resistant to insulin--allowing them to absorb more protein and therefore grow more muscle mass.

**Other causes:**

- Avoid snacking (spikes insulin)

- Avoid refined carbs and sugar

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do intermittent fasting

- Keep your carbs under 50 g/day

- Consume moderate amounts of protein (6 to 8 oz per meal)

## What Are The Underlying Factors Contributing To Adrenal Fatigue

# What are the underlying factors contributing to adrenal fatigue?

**Cause #1: Chronic stress**

Chronic stress can cause your adrenal glands to work without rest at producing stress hormones (like cortisol). Over time, chronic stress causes adrenal glands to burn out and not function properly. Therefore, your body can’t handle stress effectively anymore because your cells become resistant to stress hormones being overproduced.

 [See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/treating-adrenal-fatigue-with-sleep-most-important-action-for-adrenal-fatigue-drberg)

**Cause #2: Low vitamin B1**

Vitamin B1 (thiamin) is vital for normal functioning of the nervous system and for regulating stress levels in the body. Low vitamin B1 can reduce your ability to handle physical and mental stress. If you are deficient in B1 your adrenal glands can eventually wear out, resulting in the adrenal fatigue symptoms mentioned above.

**Remedies:**

- Take vitamin B1

- nutritional yeast

- benfotiamine

- Avoid alcohol

- Avoid drinking too much coffee or tea

- Avoid diuretics and antibiotics

     [See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/the-non-stress-cause-of-adrenal-fatigue-symptoms-vitamin-b1thiamine-deficiency-drberg)

**Other causes:**

- Too many carbs in the diet

- No exercise

- Too much caffeine

- Lack of salt (take sea salt)

- Sudden shock (surgery, loss of loved one, accident)

- Chronic pain in the body part (do acupressure)

- Chronic infection (improve immune strength)

- Taking prednisone for a long time (stress medication)

## What Should I Do If I Cant Make My Kids Eat Healthy Foods

# What should I do if I can’t make my kids eat healthy foods?

If your child only eats junk food, here’s what you need to know:

1\. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Picky eating often results from deficiencies in nutrients like zinc, DHA, and vitamin B1. These can affect taste, mood, and behavior.

2\. **Common Culprits**: Foods like sugary cereals, french fries, and packaged snacks often contain MSG and refined carbs, which can worsen these deficiencies and increase appetite.

3\. **Healthy Alternatives**: Switch to Healthy Keto® foods. Instead of banning junk food, find healthy substitutes and involve your child in cooking.

4\. **Supplements**: Consider supplements to address nutrient deficiencies and make the transition to healthy eating easier.

## Can I Eat Spinach On Keto

# Can I eat spinach on keto?

Most definitely. It’s rich in iron, magnesium, vitamins K and C, folic acid, B2 and B6. It supports the eyes, preventing macular degeneration, and it’s good for inflammation. The health benefits of spinach are huge.

However, spinach has oxalates, which can cause kidney stones.

To counter oxalates, you can steam your spinach, you can add lemon juice and potassium citrate. You can also consume some calcium-rich food together with the spinach (in the same meal, not separately); this will allow calcium to bind with oxalates in your digestive system so they are prevented from forming stones in the kidneys.

Make sure spinach is organic to avoid unwanted chemicals.

## Can I Consume Flaxseed Oil On Keto

# Can I consume flaxseed oil on keto?

Not really. It is a highly refined product and is not recommended on keto.

Although flax seeds are loaded with omega-3, ligands, fiber, B1, etc. the problem is that flax has enzymes and enzyme inhibitors that prevent the absorption of nutrients. If you consume sprouted flax, you will absorb nutrients much better.

## Can I Use Cassava Flour On Keto

# Can I use cassava flour on keto?

No. Cassava is very high in carbohydrates. It’s also very high on the glycemic index. Cassava is a starch – a root vegetable. It’s not keto-friendly. Cassava is also used to make tapioca, which is not keto-friendly, either. Another name for cassava is yuca. Cassava or yuca are not keto- friendly.

Cassava also contains very small amounts of vitamin B1 (thiamine). This is a problem because any time you have something with a lot of carbs and low vitamin B1, you can create a vitamin B1 deficiency. This happens because you use up vitamin B1 to metabolize carbs.

---

## Can The Ketogenic Diet Lead To Feelings Of Fatigue

# Can the ketogenic diet lead to feelings of fatigue?

It can, during the transition period or if you do it incorrectly. It can mean:

- You need more B vitamins (especially B1 and B5) – these 2 vitamins are crucial in the metabolism and the ability to make energy

- A need to increase potassium (eat large quantities of vegetables)

- Deficiency of stomach acids (apple cider vinegar, sea salt, betaine hydrochloride )

- Hidden carbohydrates in your food

- Decreased blood sugars (feeling tired)

- High blood sugar (tired after eating)

- Need for more sleep

There might be other reasons behind tiredness that are not keto-related. It could be connected to digestion, or stress or inflammation, for example. Try to handle the root cause while following a Healthy Keto® plan.

---

## Can I Get Rid Of Kidney Stones On Keto

# Can I get rid of kidney stones on keto?

The ketogenic diet itself doesn't directly counter kidney stones, but certain remedies can help prevent them:

1\. Phytic acid can prevent calcium crystallization, a common cause of kidney stones. Increase intake by consuming moderate protein and plenty of vegetables.

2\. Take vitamin C to bind with calcium and prevent stone formation.

3\. Stay hydrated and add electrolytes to your fluids, especially if sedentary.

4\. Drink lemon water and ensure adequate intake of vitamin B6 and calcium-rich foods like grass-fed dairy.

5\. Consider calcium orotate as a supplement, as it may reduce calcium buildup in the kidneys.

6\. Address magnesium deficiency, but if consuming ample vegetables, additional supplementation may not be necessary.

If you've strayed from the keto plan, simply resume it along with intermittent fasting. Gradually transition into ketosis, reduce snacking, and supplement with potassium, sodium, and nutritional yeast. Additionally, take the opportunity to deepen your understanding of the ketogenic diet to enhance self-control and success.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## How Can I Fix Water Retention On Keto

# How can I fix water retention on keto?

Possible causes of water retention and their fixes:

- Low in vitamin B1 (thiamine) – vitamin B1 deficiencies will create fluid retention and edema in the ankles. Add nutritional yeast to your diet.

- Low potassium – not consuming enough vegetables can keep potassium low. But if you are consuming a lot of vegetables and still have fluid retention, it’s because you can’t digest all the fiber and that it is too much for the microorganisms that you have. Your potassium source must be from among the leafy greens and it is needed to push out the fluids.

- Fiber – a hidden source of fluid retention. It retains fluid and the body will demand fluid to bulk up the fiber, to make the stool form and go through the system.

- High salt consumption

- High-carb diet – or too many carbs, because carbohydrates retain fluid.

## What Causes Adrenal Fatigue Outside Of Stress

# What causes adrenal fatigue outside of stress?

The adrenals consist of an outer glandular layer that produces cortisol and other hormones, and an inner layer that makes neurotransmitters. The inner part is involved in the fight or flight response (sympathetic nervous system), countered by the parasympathetic nervous system. If the parasympathetic system is weak, you may feel constantly stressed. Low vitamin B1 (thiamine) affects the brain stem and can impair stress adaptation, causing dizziness when standing up quickly. Symptoms of adrenal fatigue and B1 deficiency include:

• Low ability to adapt to stress

• Anxiety

• Fatigue

Common causes of vitamin B1 deficiency are:

• Refined carbs and sugar

• Alcohol

• Coffee

• Tea

• Sulfites

• Antibiotics

• Diuretics

## Im Feeling Weak And Fainting After 20 Hours Of Fasting   What Do I Do

# I'm feeling weak and fainting after 20 hours of fasting - what do I do?

**Realize this: you’re going from glucose metabolism to running on ketones and fatty acids, which takes time. And it will take a lot longer if you already have diabetes or insulin resistance. It could take months.**

Let’s say you’re at two meals. Your first meal is at 2pm and your second at 6pm, then you fast for twenty hours. If you’re having a hard time with this schedule, and you feel weak and faint, back up a little to eighteen hours of fasting. Eat at 12pm and 6pm. You haven’t given your body enough time to adapt. You want to let how you feel dictate how quickly you should go from, say, thirteen hours or so of fasting, eating three meals per day at 7am, 12pm, and 6pm. If you feel good, then go to eighteen, and then when you feel good, to twenty.

When you’re at three meals per day, avoid snacks and add more fat to your meals until you’re comfortable and your cravings go away. You also want to feel energetic and have good cognitive function.

**Fainting and feeling weak could be low sodium. Make sure you’re consuming at least one teaspoon of sea salt per day. If you’re exercising you may need a teaspoon and a half. You may also need to increase your B vitamins, especially B1, as well as your electrolytes: potassium and magnesium. Your B vitamins and electrolytes are involved in your metabolism, which helps you to make energy so if you're not taking them that could be why you feel weak and faint. You can add MCT oil to your diet, which gives you more ketones to run on.**

You may not be able to get into ketosis without some help if your insulin resistance is severe enough. Other people are using my fasting tea, which seems to help because it has certain phytonutrients to help their blood sugar.

The main point is to reduce your fasting window if you’re feeling weak and faint after twenty hours of intermittent fasting then gradually increase it.

## Is Feeling Cold Normal When Doing Intermittent Fasting

# Is feeling cold normal when doing intermittent fasting?

Feeling cold is a normal sensation that occurs when you do not eat for stretches of time. The body's core temperature will decrease due to lower calorie intake and lower levels of blood sugar. As you continue fasting, your body will adapt and the cold feelings will lessen, but you can take vitamin B1 to ease this transition.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Dry Skin And What Effective Strategie B38A0B

# What are the potential causes of dry skin, and what effective strategies and treatments can be employed to alleviate this condition?

Dry, cracked, or scaly skin can cause a lot of irritation. Although harsh chemicals can cause skin dryness, the most common dietary cause is low levels of omega-3 fatty acid.

**Cause #1: Lack of alpha-linolenic acid:**

Alpha-linolenic acid is mainly involved in building and making the structure of your body cells. It is crucial for providing moisture to the skin and reducing inflammation.

**Cause #2: Lack of bile**

If you eat the above foods and your dry skin condition doesn’t resolve, it could mean that these acids are not digested well. Particularly, lack of bile can cause an inability to digest and absorb alpha-linolenic acid from food. This can be due to a removed gallbladder or liver/gallbladder- related problems.

## What Can I Do To Remedy Excessive Sweating

# What can I do to remedy excessive sweating?

It’s the overstimulation of the eccrine gland that really causes excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), and it’s typically triggered by stress.

Even though you might not feel stressed, your body may have a low threshold for stress and can respond to even the smallest things.

Some treatments for hyperhidrosis or excessive sweating are surgery or medications. But, we want to explore more natural alternatives for excessive sweating.

Natural remedies for excessive sweating:

1\. Rosmarinic acid (rosemary and sage)

2\. Vitamin B1 (thiamine)

## Why Do I Feel Scared

# Why do I feel scared?

A nutrient deficiency that’s most likely to put you in a state of fear is a vitamin B1 deficiency (thiamine). Without enough vitamin B1, certain parts of the body can’t work right. For example, you could have problems with the amygdala, the autonomic nervous system, or the adrenals. 

The best source of vitamin B1 is nutritional yeast. You can get this as a powder or tablet. Just make sure it doesn’t come with synthetic fortification.

## What Are The Potential Health Benefits Associated With The Daily Consu A0B228

# What are the potential health benefits associated with the daily consumption of cloves?

**Clove is natural, and there is a lot of interesting research on using it to promote a healthy body. One of the most common ways to use clove is as a numbing agent for a toothache.** The essential oil in clove called eugenol produces many benefits. But it also contains a lot of other phytonutrients.

You can use clove oil or simply chew and swallow a piece of clove. You can also use clove oil topically on the scalp for fungus or pathogens. It may even help reduce the toxicity created as a byproduct of fungus.

- Clove may help enhance the effects of an antibiotic, allowing you to use lower amounts of it.

- Clove oil may also help inhibit H. pylori and improve peptic ulcers, gastritis, indigestion, gas, and bloating.

- A certain phytonutrient in clove is an MAO inhibitor. MAO inhibitors are used as antidepressants.

- Clove even has anti-inflammatory effects, and data shows it has anticancer properties.

**Clove is relatively safe, but consuming too much clove oil could create a toxic effect. You should avoid clove if you are allergic to it or are pregnant or lactating.**

## What Are Some Effective Natural Home Remedies For Managing And Treatin B3Bade

# What are some effective natural home remedies for managing and treating tinea versicolor?

It looks similar to vitiligo but less intense. This fungus releases an acid that inhibits melanin, causing a loss of pigment. If you get it, you then have an 80% chance of getting it again.

**HOME REMEDY**

1\. Oregano oil

2\. Tea Tree Oil

3\. Thyme Oil

4\. Grapefruit Seed Oil

5\. Coconut Oil

Mix 4 drops of 1 or more of these oils in a tablespoon of coconut oil and mix - then apply it to your skin before bed. However, you need to work on your gut because ultimately, it's a loss of internal microbes that set you up for this condition. Antibiotics, cortisone treatments, being a diabetic, having PCOS, and even malnutrition can all set you up for getting this condition.

## Is It Advisable To Take Niacin And Tudca Together And What Are The Pot 1Cc099

# Is it advisable to take niacin and TUDCA together, and what are the potential benefits or interactions between these two supplements?

Niacin and TUDCA should only be taken together if there is a specific concern. TUDCA, a bile salt containing choline, aids digestion and breaks down cholesterol. If you follow a healthy ketogenic diet with low carbs and intermittent fasting, you typically don't need to worry about cholesterol. Issues arise when the diet is not followed strictly, or if carbohydrates are still being consumed.

Bloating is that uncomfortable feeling of fullness and tightness in your stomach. It can be caused by various factors, including:

- **Diet:** Certain foods, especially those high in FODMAPs, can trigger gas production and bloating. Eating too quickly or consuming large meals can also strain your digestive tract.

- **Medical Conditions:** IBS and lactose intolerance are common conditions often associated with bloating.

- **Other Factors:** Swallowing air, carbonated drinks, and hormonal changes can also contribute.

**Foods That Fight Bloating**

- **High-Fiber Foods:** Soluble fiber, found in avocado, sunflower seeds, and hazelnuts, can reduce bloating by absorbing water and softening stool. However, excessive insoluble fiber from vegetables and whole grains can lead to gas and bloating. Gradually increase your intake and choose low-gas options like berries, citrus fruits, and cooked vegetables.

- **Ginger Tea:** Ginger has anti-inflammatory and carminative properties, soothing the digestive tract and relieving gas.

**Worst Foods for Bloating**

- **Cruciferous Vegetables:** Broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts are nutritious but can cause bloating due to their high FODMAP content. Cooking them thoroughly and consuming them in moderation can help.

- **Dairy Products:** For those with lactose intolerance, dairy can trigger bloating. Try lactose-free alternatives or fermented dairy products with probiotics.

- **High-Sodium Foods:** Excess salt leads to water retention, exacerbating bloating. Choose whole, unprocessed foods, low-sodium options, and increase potassium intake.

**Lifestyle Changes**

- **Mindful Eating:** Eating slowly and chewing thoroughly reduces air swallowing and aids digestion.

- **Hydration:** Drinking plenty of water prevents constipation and bloating.

**Bloating and Fasting**

Bloating during fasting can occur due to changes in eating patterns. Stay hydrated, consume fiber-rich foods during non-fasting periods, avoid carbonated drinks, and consider natural remedies like peppermint or ginger tea.

**Conclusion**

Understanding the best and worst foods for belly bloating empowers you to make informed dietary choices and enjoy your meals without discomfort. Remember, a balanced diet, mindful eating, and proper hydration are key to a happier gut.

## Can I Do Keto And Intermittent Fasting If Im A Diabetic On Metformin A 35Db2E

# Can I do Keto and Intermittent Fasting if I'm a diabetic on metformin and insulin?

Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, both conditions involve high blood sugar and insulin. Metformin makes insulin receptors more responsive, while insulin replaces what the pancreas lacks. In type 1 diabetes, insulin is used to control unstable blood sugars, often resulting in high insulin levels. High insulin is more dangerous than high sugar, as it can damage the retina, kidneys, arteries, and brain. The goal is to minimize insulin use. For type 1 diabetes, despite potentially irreversibly damaged beta cells, it's crucial to reduce insulin use by focusing on diet and intermittent fasting to lower carb intake and improve insulin resistance. Work with your doctor to adjust medications accordingly.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Do Low Fat Diets Cause Gallstones

# Do low fat diets cause gallstones?

## **The Myth of Low-Fat Diets and Gallstones**

Contrary to the misconception that a low-fat diet can ward off gallstones, it is [bile deficiency](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-know-if-you-have-bile-deficiency) caused by high insulin levels or other factors like high estrogen, birth control pills, and pregnancy, which is responsible for their formation.

Fats are crucial in triggering bile release, which helps dissolve gallstones.

### **The Role of Fats in Bile Release**

Fats are not the enemy when [preventing gallstones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-low-fat-diet-to-prevent-gallstones-myth); they're our allies. Consuming fatty foods triggers our body to produce bile and discharge it into the small intestine, assisting in breaking down these fats for digestion.

This process keeps your bile flowing regularly, reducing the risk of gallstone formation. So, eating less fat could increase your chances of developing gallstones because it reduces the need for regular bile release.

### **How High Insulin Levels Deplete Bile**

In addition to fat consumption playing a crucial role in maintaining healthy bile flow, another important factor is keeping insulin levels under control.

High insulin levels can deplete your body's supply of stored bile salts needed for adequate digestion and absorption of dietary fats.

Consuming large amounts of sugar or refined carbohydrates can cause spikes in blood sugar levels, leading to increased insulin production - setting off a chain reaction that ultimately leads to depleted reserves of vital digestive enzymes like bile acids.
