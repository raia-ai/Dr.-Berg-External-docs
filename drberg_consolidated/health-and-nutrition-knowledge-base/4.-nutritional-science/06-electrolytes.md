## Can I Rely On Nutritional Facts Alone To Determine Whether The Food Is 94D71C

# Can I rely on nutritional facts alone to determine whether the food is healthy?

Let’s compare the nutrition facts of Product A and Product B to see which food is healthier. Product A contains 29 grams of total fat, 4 grams of saturated fat, 17 grams of carbohydrates, and 1 gram of sugar.

Product B contains 8 grams of total fat, 1 gram of saturated fat, 16 grams of carbohydrates, and 0 grams of sugar. Based on these nutrition facts, which food is healthier?

Product A is an avocado, and Product B is Doritos! Doritos contain corn, vegetable oil, maltodextrin, monosodium glutamate, dextrose, and many other poor ingredients—yet you may have thought Product B was the healthier food. You can't rely on nutritional facts alone to determine whether a food is healthy; you must look at the ingredients.

Food is “that which is eaten to sustain life, provide energy, and promote the growth and repair of tissues.” Ultra-processed foods do not align with this definition! I believe that of everything that causes disease and destroys your health, ultra-processed foods are the most significant factor.

## What Is The Biggest Danger Of Prolonged Fasting

# What is the biggest danger of prolonged fasting?

Prolonged fasting is very beneficial to support a healthy body. However, there is one aspect of prolonged fasting that can be dangerous, and that’s what we’re going to cover today. Prolonged fasting is when you fast for three or more days. The biggest danger of prolonged fasting is called refeeding syndrome. This can happen if a person consumes too much of the wrong foods too fast after coming off of a prolonged fast.

However, the risk of refeeding syndrome is low if you aren’t malnourished going into a prolonged fast. As a bare minimum, when you start any type of fasting, you need to take electrolytes and B vitamins.

## What Is The Leading Ingredient Other Than Sugar That Contributes To We 25Cba8

# What is the leading ingredient, other than sugar, that contributes to weight gain?

## Hidden in Plain Sight: The Flavor Enhancer That Could Be Sabotaging Your Health

It's lurking in your favorite snacks, convenience foods, and even restaurant meals – a seemingly innocent ingredient that could be contributing to weight gain and a host of health issues.

**Monosodium Glutamate (MSG): A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing**

Despite being classified as "generally recognized as safe" (GRAS) by the FDA, MSG, a common flavor enhancer, has a dark side. Studies have linked MSG consumption in mice to:

- **Obesity**

- **Diabetes**

- **Metabolic disorders**

- **Fatty liver disease**

**How Does MSG Impact the Body?**

- **Disrupts appetite regulation:** MSG overstimulates the hypothalamus, the brain region responsible for controlling hunger and satiety, leading to overeating.

- **Hinders energy utilization:** MSG can interfere with the body's ability to burn calories effectively.

- **Affects fertility:** Research suggests that MSG may have negative impacts on reproductive health.

The average person consumes a staggering 590 mg to 2330 mg of MSG daily, with some individuals ingesting up to 5000 mg! And when combined with carbohydrates, MSG's effects are amplified.

**Beyond Weight Gain: The Hidden Dangers of MSG**

MSG isn't just a concern for your waistline. It has also been linked to:

- **Headaches**

- **Allergy-like symptoms**

- **Irritability**

- **Sleep disturbances**

- **Dizziness**

**Unmasking Hidden MSG**

Food manufacturers are allowed to hide MSG under different names or omit it from the ingredient list altogether if it's present in small amounts. This makes it difficult to avoid.

**Foods That Often Contain MSG:**

- Instant noodles

- Chips

- Flavored popcorn

- Canned soups

- Bouillon cubes

- Processed meats

- Fast food

- Seasonings

- Salad dressings

- Frozen dinners

- Gravy

- Appetizers

- Flavored crackers

- Canned vegetables

**Protecting Your Health:**

Become a savvy label reader and be mindful of the processed foods you consume. Choose whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible to minimize your MSG intake and safeguard your health.

## How Can I Unclog My Colon

# How can I unclog my colon?

Digestion starts in the mouth, where food is broken down and then transferred to the stomach. The highly acidic stomach acid aids in protein digestion. The valve at the top of the stomach plays a vital role in keeping food in the stomach and preventing it from backing up into the esophagus. Many people think antacids are the solution to acid reflux or heartburn. Diluting stomach acid worsens this problem by inhibiting this valve from closing tightly.

If you have acid reflux, you want to increase the acidity of your stomach. Diluted apple cider vinegar and betaine hydrochloride are effective remedies for this problem. Ninety percent of all digestion occurs in the small intestine. This is also the location of a leaky gut. Grains, gluten, junk food, refined sugar, and seed oils can cause a leaky gut. The liver makes bile, which is stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. Bile helps break down fats, extract nutrients from fats, and kill pathogens. Bile deficiency symptoms include bloating, burping, vision problems, and gallstones. Bile salts such as TUDCA can help digestion by breaking down cholesterol.

Microbes break down food in the large intestine through fermentation. These microbes comprise 80% of your immune system and help make neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. After your food travels through this intricate assembly line, it becomes stool. Your stool is mostly water and gets its pigment from your red blood cells. The smell is caused by gas from bacteria. Constipation and diarrhea are usually related to missing microbes. Antibiotics and chemicals like glyphosate can deplete microbes. Fermented foods and the L. reuteri microbe are great ways to increase microbes and improve digestion naturally. Intermittent fasting can also significantly improve digestion.

## What Is The Carb That Lowers Cholesterol

# What is the carb that lowers cholesterol?

In some cases, it’s not a problem if cholesterol is a little bit higher. This can happen when you first start the keto diet because you’re mobilizing cholesterol from the fat cells. But what can you do if you need to lower bad cholesterol naturally? There is one specific food that can really help you. Your body makes cholesterol. Excess cholesterol is eliminated through the bile ducts with the help of bile salts. Bile salts have a lot of important roles in the body.

Typically, carbohydrates will increase cholesterol and triglycerides. There are three types of carbohydrates: sugar, starches, and fiber. Fiber can actually help reduce your cholesterol, but it has to be the right type of fiber. We’re talking about the fiber in vegetables. Vegetables have low amounts of sugar and high amounts of fiber. They’re also rich in nutrients, phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Fiber helps bind with cholesterol and modify the absorption of lipids and fats. It also increases the production of bile and eliminates bile connected to cholesterol. Fiber has zero effect on blood sugar and insulin, which will help lower your cholesterol. Feeding your microbes fiber also decreases the production of cholesterol. If you have high cholesterol, consume more vegetables to help increase the release of bile and feed the microbes. At the same time, be sure to avoid sugar and starch in your diet.

## Which Type Of Carbohydrate Lowers Ldl Cholesterol Quickly And How Does 31125B

# Which type of carbohydrate lowers LDL cholesterol quickly, and how does it work?

Ever wondered why doctors recommend vegetables for high cholesterol? The secret lies in vegetable fiber! It's like having tiny bodyguards fighting cholesterol in your system.

**Understanding Cholesterol and Bile Salts**

Your body produces more cholesterol than you consume. Bile salts, produced by the liver, act as a detergent, breaking down fats and escorting excess cholesterol out of your body. Insufficient bile production can lead to constipation and increased cholesterol levels.

**Vegetable Fiber: The Cholesterol-Lowering Champion**

Vegetable fiber is superior to other fibers for reducing cholesterol. It acts like a sponge, soaking up bile salts and preventing their reabsorption into the bloodstream. Unlike other fibers, vegetable fiber doesn't raise insulin levels, making it an ideal choice.

**Nutritional Powerhouses**

Vegetables are low in sugar, high in fiber, and packed with phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals, making them essential for overall health and cholesterol management.

**How Fiber Works its Magic**

- **Binds with Cholesterol:** Fiber traps cholesterol in the gut, preventing it from entering the bloodstream.

- **Increases Bile Production:** Fiber encourages the liver to produce more bile salts, further aiding cholesterol elimination.

- **Stabilizes Blood Sugar and Insulin:** Fiber doesn't spike blood sugar or insulin levels, unlike simple carbs.

- **Nourishes Gut Microbes:** Fiber feeds beneficial gut bacteria, which produce short-chain fatty acids that reduce inflammation and promote gut health, crucial for managing cholesterol.

**Dietary Recommendations**

- **Increase Vegetable Intake:** Aim for at least five servings of fiber-rich vegetables like broccoli, carrots, and Brussels sprouts daily.

- **Avoid Sugars and Starches:** Reduce consumption of sugary drinks and refined carbohydrates, as they raise blood sugar and indirectly contribute to high cholesterol.

**Conclusion**

Lowering cholesterol naturally starts with adding more vegetables to your diet. They are your allies in the battle against high cholesterol, thanks to their fiber content and nutritional benefits. By making simple dietary changes, you can take control of your health and enjoy a cholesterol-friendly lifestyle.

## Do Keto And Fasting Increase Stress Hormones

# Do Keto and fasting Increase stress hormones?

Do keto and fasting increase stress hormones? The answer is no.

Some people believe that it appears to be stressful on the body because you're starving the body of glucose. However, a person has fat on their body to be used as fuel. Logically, our bodies are meant to run off of fat between meals.

Cortisol is a stress hormone. It is also called glucocorticoid. One of the major functions of cortisol is to keep your blood sugars from getting too low. It releases stored glucose or causes the production of glucose to maintain blood sugar levels. This isn't a stress event; it's a normal thing that occurs in the body.

It takes about three days for the body to adapt from burning glucose to burning fat. Cortisol can rise a little bit when a person goes through the three-day keto-adaptation phase, but then it levels out.

When you run your body on glucose, it is very stressful for the body, and you can't tap into your own fat. However, when you get into ketosis, you could go from a stress state to a much higher level of calmness and a state of well-being. Burning fat or being in ketosis is a non-stressful state. Keep in mind, that when you start keto and fasting, it's important to take electrolytes and B vitamins.

## What Are The Most Effective And Rapid Strategies For Detoxifying The L F3Bf1C

# What are the most effective and rapid strategies for detoxifying the liver, and how do various dietary, lifestyle, and supplementation approaches contribute to this process?

**Here are some tips for supporting your liver health:**

To support and speed up liver detoxification, we need to trigger autophagy.

The best ways to trigger autophagy:

1\. Dry fasting (Recommend doing it under medical supervision)

2\. Water fasting

3\. Calorie restriction

4\. Sleep

5\. Exercise

6\. Keto diet

7\. Phytonutrients

Dry fasting (recommended under medical supervision) is one of the most powerful ways to trigger autophagy and truly cleanse the liver cells.

With dry fasting, you don’t consume any food or water. To cleanse the liver, you may want to consider dry fasting for a full day—starting at sunrise and ending at sunset.

The effects of just one day of dry fasting are equivalent to three days of water fasting.

Additional benefits of dry fasting:

• Enhanced immunity

• Liver and kidney support

• Mental clarity

• Decreased inflammation

When the sun sets, you’ll eat your one meal for the day, which should consist of meat and cruciferous vegetables. These foods are also great for cleaning the liver.

Try dry fasting for three days of the month (they don't need to be consecutive) and see how you feel. (recommended that it is done under medical supervision)

Before you start dry fasting, take bile salts or TUDCA, consume beets, or drink apple cider vinegar with water to help thin your bile.

This can help prevent any negative liver detox side effects.

## How Do Statins Function In The Management Of Cholesterol Levels And Wh 420E69

# How do statins function in the management of cholesterol levels, and what are the potential side effects and risks associated with their long-term use?

**How Statins Work and Their Potential Side Effects**

Statins are medications that lower cholesterol by blocking an enzyme crucial for its production in the liver. However, cholesterol isn't just from your diet – your body makes it, too.

**Cholesterol, Bile Salts, and Health Risks**

Cholesterol is essential for producing bile salts, which help digest fats and absorb certain vitamins and omega-3s. Statins can disrupt this process. Low bile salt levels may increase the risk of gallstones and pancreatitis.

**Statin-Related Muscle Issues**

A common side effect of statins is myopathy, a general term for muscle disease. This can manifest as muscle weakness, wasting, lower back pain, and potentially even heart failure. Statins may also deplete CoQ10, an enzyme vital for muscle energy production.

**The Importance of CoQ10**

CoQ10 deficiency can worsen statin-related muscle issues. Supplementing with CoQ10 while taking statins might help reduce these side effects.

**Important Note:** Always consult your doctor before starting or stopping any medications or supplements.

## What Is The Nature Of Nausea

# What is the nature of nausea?

## **Understanding Nausea: More Than Just a Feeling**

Nausea is often more than just a feeling; it can be a symptom of various underlying health issues. Understanding the causes and triggers of nausea is essential for effective management and treatment.

From motion sickness to gastrointestinal problems, exploring the root causes of nausea can lead to targeted interventions and relief strategies.

![Image](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/video-thumbnails/7fac003c-5454-456a-88f9-1d8a3fa2c715.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

### **The Nature of Nausea**

Nausea is like that annoying guest at your party who wasn't invited. It's not just an unpleasant feeling but a complex protective mechanism.

Imagine your body flashing a warning light, telling you things aren't quite right inside, maybe because of sickness, something you ate that didn't agree with you, or even tension.

Feeling queasy often signals your body's effort to expel unwelcome invaders, setting the stage for potential upchucking. Yet, nausea doesn't always lead to throwing up. For some folks, it lingers without any relief in sight.

Furthermore, its influence on general well-being is more significant than one might assume. Persistent nausea can lead to dehydration and malnutrition since eating becomes about as appealing as hugging a cactus.

### **Identifying the Causes**

Pinning down what triggers your nausea is akin to solving a mystery with multiple suspects.

The usual culprits include dietary choices, infections (like those pesky stomach bugs), medications that disagree with you, motion sickness from travel, or migraines—essentially, anything from A can set off this unwelcome alarm.

Finding the root cause is crucial for tailoring treatment effectively because, let’s face it, no one enjoys shooting in the dark, especially when dealing with how they feel physically daily.

So understanding these triggers helps put you back in control—not entirely unlike figuring out which foods turn you into Mr Ms.Gassy at social gatherings.

## What Could Be The Underlying Causes Of Significant Abdominal Distensio B7C910

# What could be the underlying causes of significant abdominal distension or a large belly that is not attributed to excess fat?

**This type of protruded stomach is caused by a damaged liver. The damaged liver is causing leakage of fluid and accumulation of a protein fluid in the abdominal cavity.** 

With this condition, there is a replacement of the normal healthy liver cells with fibrous scar tissue, and you end up losing the function of the liver cells.  Cirrhosis doesn't happen overnight. It takes years to develop. This could happen from consuming alcohol, or from years of poor eating. It usually starts with inflammation, and typically the person will have a fatty liver as well. The inflammation is part of an immune response, and the body heals with scar tissue. 

Typically, what's done medically, is the lower the person's sodium, and put them on diuretics. 

**Here are a few natural things you can do:**

1\. Lower your carbohydrates 

2\. Stop consuming alcohol 

3\. Consume moderate protein and fat 

4\. Consume cruciferous vegetables

5\. Intermittent fasting 

6\. Give it time (3 years)

## What Can I Do For Dry Skin

# What can I do for dry skin?

I would definitely start with the omega-3 fatty acids for the skin. That is the key to prevent dry skin. It's not necessarily hydration with water. It is oils. So you need cod liver oil. And that would help your skin greatly. Of course, you can also have dry skin if you're lacking the B vitamins. You'd want nutritional yeast for that. Go ahead and try those two things and see if you can actually shed less skin.

## What Is The Most Common Symptom Of Dehydration

# What is the most common symptom of dehydration?

The most common symptom of dehydration is fatigue. When the body lacks adequate hydration, electrolyte balance, particularly sodium, is disrupted, leading to weakness and reduced energy levels. Proper fluid intake is essential not only for maintaining hydration but also for ensuring optimal electrolyte levels, crucial for overall strength and vitality.

## Why Should You Never Drink Seawater If You Get Stranded At Sea

# Why should you never drink seawater if you get stranded at sea?

It will actually cause dehydration because of the high salt levels. Because what happens is you're doing this concentrated salt and you are literally pulling any and all water out of your system. And your kidneys can't help but get rid of the salt. The little bit of water you have left. So basically you accelerate the death process. You accelerate your dehydration problem.

## What Is The Optimal Time To Take Probiotics For Maximizing Their Effec C9D478

# What is the optimal time to take probiotics for maximizing their effectiveness, and how does timing impact their benefits?

Probiotics are microbes. Microbes are a crucial part of our world. They convert carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur into forms that living things can use. We have ten times more microbes living on and inside our bodies than we have cells.

**Microbes have many functions and help us in various ways, including:**

• Helping to make nutrients available

• Providing immune protection

• Protecting against pathogens

• Supporting detoxification

• Improving digestion

• Helping to make vitamins

Strong hydrochloric acid in the stomach can kill a good portion of microbes. Bile salts also affect the microbiome. But, some microbes are resilient and can even live without oxygen.

**How to support the survival of probiotics in the stomach:**

1\. Take a probiotic supplement or consume probiotic foods at the end of your meal

2\. Consume probiotics earlier in the day

3\. If fasting, drink more water with your probiotics

4\. Don’t take probiotics with lemon water or apple cider vinegar water

5\. Consume raw plants grown in soil

## What Are Effective Strategies For Stopping Extreme Itching All Over The Body

# What are effective strategies for stopping extreme itching all over the body?

To address extreme itching across your body, consider the following steps:

1\. **TUDCA Supplementation**: Take TUDCA, a bile salt that aids in enhancing bile duct drainage in the liver. Start with two capsules daily on an empty stomach—one in the morning and one in the afternoon. This can help reduce systemic itching by alleviating bile accumulation in the liver, which may enter the bloodstream and cause skin irritation.

2\. **Gut Microbiome Support**: Support your gut health, particularly if you've used steroids, which can disrupt your gut flora. Begin with a high-quality probiotic, starting with a small dose and gradually increasing it to minimize potential immune reactions.

These measures may help mitigate the itching and improve overall skin comfort.

## What Are Some Effective Strategies Or Treatments For Alleviating Right E5C9E7

# What are some effective strategies or treatments for alleviating right shoulder pain?

For right-shoulder pain and gallbladder discomfort, consider taking purified bile salts. Use a gallbladder formula with food and on an empty stomach. Taking two doses on an empty stomach twice a day can help open the bile ducts and improve bile flow. Apple cider vinegar can also increase bile production, but starting with additional bile salts may be beneficial.

## What Are The Most Effective Remedies For Addressing Dry And Wrinkly Sk 47Df11

# What are the most effective remedies for addressing dry and wrinkly skin, and how can these treatments improve skin hydration and elasticity?

Anything you put on the skin gets directly absorbed into your body.

**Because your skin is mainly composed of protein and fat, a low-fat diet is one of the worst things for your skin. Seed oils, synthetic starches, and synthetic sugars also have detrimental effects on your skin health.**

Seed oils like corn oil, cottonseed oil, canola oil, soy oil, safflower oil, and sunflower oil are very high in omega-6 fatty acids. These highly processed oils are deodorized and decolorized and are made using solvents like hexane. They can get lodged into your membranes and can stay there for two and a half to three years.

When you consume too many omega-6 fatty acids (seed oils) and not enough omega-3 fatty acids, you develop dry, red, flaky skin. Your skin may also start to look older.

**Grass-fed beef tallow is very similar to your skin’s natural sebum and will not oxidize the skin or cause inflammation. Tallow contains vitamins A, D, E, and K and the compound CLA, which helps the skin retain moisture.**

**Tallow softens the skin and leaves it with a healthy glow.** The nutrients in tallow can also help eliminate dark spots and wrinkles. Tallow is fifty percent saturated fat and contains oleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, and linoleic acid—all of which have positive benefits for your skin. For better skin, remove seed oils from the diet, apply tallow to the skin, and consume more omega-3 fatty acids. You should notice improvement in your skin in a matter of weeks.

## What Is The Initial Symptom That Typically Indicates The Presence Of G 841378

# What is the initial symptom that typically indicates the presence of gallstones?

Gallstones often present without symptoms in 80% of cases, but symptoms can include pain under the right ribcage and rhomboid, nausea, vomiting, and digestive issues like bloating and belching. The formation of gallstones is linked to high cholesterol and insufficient bile production, which is crucial for cholesterol metabolism. Bile sludge, a precursor to stones, can persist even after gallbladder removal, causing similar symptoms.

Natural approaches to manage gallstones include taking purified bile salts and probiotics, consuming salads, using acupressure, and reducing insulin levels through methods like intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet.

## Does Brain Need To Adapt To Ketosis Too

# Does brain need to adapt to ketosis too?

**The brain has the capacity to run on ketones immediately. It even prefers ketones as its fuel source.** 

• 1/3 of the brain will always run on glucose, but 2/3 of the brain runs on ketones. 

• 23% of all the energy that is generated is used by the brain. 

**Sources of ketones:**

1\. Endogenous ketones – Meaning the body can make them if you lower your carbohydrates.

2\. Exogenous ketones – Meaning ketones outside of the body like ketone salts and MCT oil. 

Your blood ketone level is what determines how many ketones are in the brain—this level should be high. Your blood ketone level is determined by your insulin and glucose levels. Your insulin levels should be on the low side of the normal range, and your glucose levels need to be low. 

The more ketones you have in the blood, the better and faster the brain will be able to use them. The brain does not need time to keto adapt. Still, you can assist this process and prevent brain fog or keto fatigue by taking ketones or MCT oil. 

Another situation where it would be a good idea to start taking exogenous ketones is if you need to improve brain function or improve memory. For example, in cases where you have memory problems or even Alzheimer’s. 

**Parts of the brain that use ketones:**

1\. Cerebral Cortex 

2\. Hypothalamus 

3\. Pituitary Gland 

4\. Pineal Gland

## What Are The Potential Health Benefits Of Incorporating Herbs Into One 9A8C2B

# What are the potential health benefits of incorporating herbs into one’s diet or wellness regimen?

Herbs are any plants with leaves, seeds or flowers used for flavoring, food, medicine or perfume. Out of all of the categories of foods, herbs are at the top of the list for the antioxidants they provide. Antioxidants provide health benefits in addition to the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients in the herbs.

**Various valuable herbs**

- Oregano - antimicrobial, antiviral and antifungal

- Sage - supports the nervous system and good for relaxation

- Peppermint - good for the digestive system

- Thyme - antimicrobial

- Lemon balm - can help calm the nervous system, reduces stress and promotes sleep

- Rosemary - antimicrobial and the oil can help stimulate hair growth

## Is Colon Cleansing Advantageous For Health

# Is colon cleansing advantageous for health?

There are several different types of colon cleansing: 

**• Colon hydrotherapy** 

This is where water goes up the rectum into the large intestine and flushes everything out. This can flush out you’re electrolytes. You may want to take electrolytes after, so you don’t become deficient. You’re also flushing out your friendly bacteria, which would need to be put back in. 

**• Herbal laxatives**

Creates a purging of the material out of the colon 

**• Colema** 

This is a combination of an enema and a colonic. The problem is that it’s very temporary. It also flushes out your electrolytes. If you’re already deficient in electrolytes, this can cause dizziness and even affect your heart. The apple juice a person is supposed to drink while doing the colema, can also keep the blood sugars up, preventing ketosis. 

Fixing your diet (doing keto) may be the best way to go. Typically, fixing the diet can fix whatever issue caused you to want to do the colon cleansing to begin with. I’m not against colon hydrotherapy as a short-term solution for constipation or other conditions. But, it should be supervised, and the electrolytes and friendly bacteria need to be put back in. 

**What you can do:** 

1\. Start fasting 

2\. Decrease inflammation 

3\. Consume phytonutrients 

4\. Consume fermented vegetables

## Why Do I Have Digestive Issues When Im Breaking My Fast

# Why do I have digestive issues when I’m breaking my fast?

This could happen because, basically, your digestive system has gone to sleep and it hasn’t woken yet. You don’t want to eat a large meal after a long fast because you will overload your system. You need to start small.

After a long fast, you may also want to take certain things, such as:

- Apple cider vinegar (ACV) or betaine hydrochloride

- Bile salts

- Enzymes

- Probiotics

Foods to avoid after a long fast:

- Nuts and nut butters

- Red meat

- Raw cruciferous vegetables

- Dairy products

## What Is A Keto Rash

# What is a keto rash?

Dr. Berg’s theory is that there are high levels of histamines being dumped into the liver. When you switch over to the keto diet, or you’re running on ketones, you’re releasing a lot of fat that’s coming out through the liver. That fat holds a lot of stuff like chemicals and toxins.

But if you don’t have a lot of bile in your gallbladder and you do a ketogenic diet, you might not be able to release the toxins that are coming out with the fat. This could create an immune reaction with the histamines. One of the purposes of bile is to break down fats. The other is to eliminate toxins. Basically, you’re trying to get rid of these toxins, but you don’t have enough bile to handle the fat being released on the keto diet, so you end up with a rash.

A great potential keto rash remedy is to add purified bile salts. This could help increase the flow of the bile through the liver and gallbladder to help eliminate toxins a lot better and reduce the keto rash that’s occurring.

## Why Am I Itching A Lot On Keto

# Why am I itching a lot on keto?

Sudden skin itchiness after starting keto can be caused by bile salts that back up from the liver into the skin. This can happen because the person has something called cholestasis.

Cholestasis is a situation where the person has a decreased flow of bile, either because there is an obstruction in one of the ducts, or there is sludge (a higher level of cholesterol and low bile). Bile is a detergent, and it can be very toxic if it’s in the wrong place, for example on the skin. A person with cholestasis may also experience a full sensation underneath the right rib cage. This may have started because you introduced more fat into the diet, and you didn’t have enough bile to handle the fat because your body hadn’t adapted yet.

Remedies for itchiness on keto:

- Consume purified bile salts (TUDCA)

- Consume choline

## How Do You Do And Read A Urine Test

# How do you do and read a urine test?

Urine test strips are not made to diagnose anything. They are simply there to give you clues to potential irregularities in your body. Follow the instructions coming with the packaging of these strips.

Most urine test strips test 10 things:

- **Protein – too much could be a sign of kidney disease, dehydration, intense exercise or a kidney stone**

- **Leukocytes – high levels could suggest an infection, UTI or kidney stone**

- **Ketones – a potential sign that you’re on a low-carb diet, or you have diabetes**

- **Glucose – levels higher than 180 could indicate diabetes**

- **Nitrites – could be a sign of nitrate-reducing bacteria, such as E. coli or gonorrhea**

- **Blood – could indicate a UTI, intense exercise or kidney stones**

- **Urobilinogen – could be a sign of liver damage, cirrhosis or hepatitis**

- **pH – levels between 6 and 7.5 could indicate uric acid stones or too much protein**

- **Specific gravity – highly-concentrated urine could indicate dehydration**

- **Bilirubin – could be an early sign of liver damage or a blocked bile duct**

## Should I Take Exogenous Ketones To Help Me Be Successful On Keto

# Should I take exogenous ketones to help me be successful on keto?

You probably don’t need this if you are doing the ketogenic diet for real, eating healthily and doing intermittent fasting.

Exogenous means coming externally to the body, versus endogenous which means coming directly from the body. Exogenous ketones have become increasingly popular – promoting getting into ketosis within 3 hours. But doing this doesn’t emphasize correcting your diet, and it doesn’t require you to cut your carbs as low.

Using this sort of product completely defeats the purpose of keto and intermittent fasting. Taking these ketone salts doesn’t necessarily mean that your body is burning your own fat as fuel; you could actually just be burning ketones from the supplement and might not even lose any weight.

When you are on the ketogenic diet you create your own endogenous ketones by decreasing your carbs and using your own body fat as fuel.

## How Can I Adjust To Incorporating More Fat Into My Diet While On Keto

# How can I adjust to incorporating more fat into my diet while on keto?

You may have started eating too much fat or added more too suddenly – more than your digestive system is used to. Cut back a little bit, and gradually increase it. Gallbladder or liver problems could cause difficulties with digesting fat as well.

Taking purified bile salts, choline, or lipase can help with fat digestion.

## How Can I Prevent Adrenal Fatigue Or Keto Flu On The Keto Diet

# How can I prevent adrenal fatigue or keto flu on the keto diet?

If you are suffering from fatigue and keto flu, you may need to consume more sea salt. Low blood pressure and lightheadedness are two more signs you may be suffering from a lack of salt. Starting a keto plan prompts significant water loss, as high-carb diets typically lead to water and sodium retention. Opt for sea salt over table salt; Himalayan pink sea salt, being unrefined, is preferable. Table salt often contains additives like dextrose, making natural salts like Himalayan pink sea salt a better choice for overall health.

Himalayan pink sea salt is beneficial because it:

• Is unrefined

• Has 84 minerals

• Is unpolluted

• Contains trace minerals

• Is antimicrobial

• Can help support healthy blood sugars

## Does Keto And Fasting Increase Stress Hormones

# Does Keto and fasting increase stress hormones?

**The answer is no.**

Some people believe that it appears to be stressful on the body because you're starving the body of glucose. But, a person has fat on their body to be used as fuel. I believe it's logical that our bodies are meant to run off of fat between meals.

**Cortisol is a stress hormone. Cortisol is also called glucocorticoid. One of the big functions of cortisol is to keep your blood sugars from getting too low. It will release stored glucose or cause the production of glucose to maintain the blood sugars. This isn't a stress event. It's a normal thing that occurs in the body.**

It takes about three days for the body to start adapting from burning glucose to burning fat. Cortisol can rise a little bit when a person goes through the three-day keto-adaptation phase, but then it levels out.

When you run your body on glucose, it is very stressful for the body, and you can't tap into your own fat. But, when you get into ketosis, you could go from a stress state to a much higher level of calmness and state of well-being. Burning fat or being in ketosis is a non-stressful state. Keep in mind, when you start keto and fasting, it's important to take electrolytes and B vitamins.

## Can Intermittent Fasting Help Reverse A Fatty Liver

# Can Intermittent Fasting help reverse a fatty liver?

Fasting is one of the most important things you can do if you have a fatty liver.  One way to know if you have a fatty liver is to simply look down at your stomach. If your stomach bulges out, chances are you have a fatty liver. You can also get a biopsy or an ultrasound to be sure.  When the liver becomes filled with fat, it spills off into areas around and inside the organs. This is why people start developing a gut. 

What causes fatty liver?

**• Sugar or refined carbohydrates**

When you consume glucose, your whole body can deal with it. But, when you consume fructose, the liver is stuck dealing with it. Indirectly your insulin will spike, and other problems with occur. The effects of fructose on the liver are very similar to the effects of alcohol on the liver. 

**A few sources of fructose you might not have thought of:**

• High fructose corn syrup 

• Fruit juice 

• Agave 

**The best way to handle a fatty liver is to reverse the flow. You have to fast. You want to work up to about 20 hours of fasting—23 hours would be even better. Don’t eat unless you’re hungry and go for as long as you can.** 

**A few more things to help speed up the process:**

• Take choline (and B vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast)

• Exercise 

• Bile salts

## What Are Important Fasting Rules

# What are important fasting rules?

The 7 most important intermittent fasting rules are as follows:

**1\. Hydration is Key**: Drinking water, tea, and coffee while fasting is beneficial. Certain teas can help extend your fast and reduce hunger. Coffee is fine, but avoid excessive consumption.

**2\. Supplement Wisely:** Taking supplements like vitamins, electrolytes, trace minerals, nutritional yeast, and omega-3 fatty acids is important while fasting. A green drink without fiber, like wheatgrass juice powder, is acceptable. Avoid protein powders and branched-chain amino acids. Bone broth or MCT oil can be tried but may not suit everyone.

**3\. Listen to Your Hunger Cues**: Only eat when you're truly hungry. If you reach your fasting goal and feel like you can go longer, it's okay to extend your fast. However, don’t push yourself to the point of weakness, fatigue, irritability, or dizziness.

**4\. Refeed Gradually:** After fasting for 48 hours or more, reintroduce food slowly. Start with a small amount of food and wait before gradually increasing your intake.

**5\. Monitor Insulin Resistance:** Your ability to fast can indicate your insulin resistance level. If fasting is easy, your insulin resistance may be improving. Difficulty fasting may suggest you still have insulin resistance and need more time and effort.

**6\. Combine with Healthy Keto:** Pair intermittent fasting with a healthy keto diet. This combination helps keep insulin levels low and offers numerous health benefits. A high-carb diet could undermine the benefits of intermittent fasting.

## What Are The Key Nutrients And Herbs For Intermittent Fasting

# What are the key nutrients and herbs for intermittent fasting?

The longer the fast you undertake, the more important your nutrient intake is. If you already have a nutrient deficiency, a long fast can aggravate it, causing symptoms like dizziness, feeling faint or tired, rashes, muscle cramps, palpitations, or chills.

Taking nutrients or herbs goes against the true definition of fasting, which is drinking only water, eating nothing, and not taking any nutrients or herbs. But, there are not enough calories involved in taking nutrients or herbs to effect the benefits of fasting. Some key nutrients for fasting include B vitamins, trace minerals, vitamins D and C, and electrolytes. Green tea, garlic, wheatgrass juice powder , and turmeric are all good herbs to consume on a fast.

## What Will Happen With My Body After A Week Of Fasting

# What will happen with my body after a week of fasting?

If you start cutting carbs, you could start losing a lot of fluid. Initially, a person could easily lose 13 pounds (5.89kg) in one week. This depends on how much water weight you have. 

One pound of fat is 3500 calories. An average person might burn roughly 2000 calories in a day. So, in theory, if everything goes perfectly, a person could lose 0.5-0.7 pounds per day while fasting. This would come out to just under 5 pounds (2.2kg) per week with fasting. 

**But, there are a lot of variables that can affect this, including:** 

• Exercise 

• Stress 

• Sleep 

• Age 

• Metabolism 

• History of consuming a lot of carbs 

• Health issues 

When you start fasting, you can stimulate growth hormone. Growth hormone protects against the loss of protein. Typically, the body doesn’t use protein as fuel. It uses the fat fuel until that’s gone, then it uses muscle. 

Let’s say someone is a bodybuilder, or they have a good amount of muscle on their body, and they’re exercising. But after they start the week fast, they don’t exercise. Potentially, their muscles could shrink because it’s the exercise that keeps the muscles stimulated and growing.  A good indicator to know if you’re fasting correctly is being able to exercise without feeling too weak and tired.

If you’re fasting, but you don’t have any energy, and you can’t do intense exercise, you may need more electrolytes.  It’s also important to make sure you’re taking enough sea salt regardless of whether or not you’re eating. Green powder drinks, B vitamins (nutritional yeast), and trace minerals may also be beneficial while fasting.  Some people think they need to load up on carbs to spike insulin to help their muscles grow. But, insulin comes with a package. And, insulin is also triggered by protein.

So, a better solution may be to have more protein instead of carbs. If you’re trying to lose weight, this isn’t a good idea. But if you’re trying to build muscle, it may be a better option.

## What Is The Most Effective Remedy For Bronchitis

# What is the most effective remedy for bronchitis?

**You can use salt.** Not necessarily taking salt, but breathing in salt. There’s a machine called a halogenerator, which provides something called halotherapy where you breathe salt air. The machine ionizes the salt and puts it out into the air. You can use it while you sleep.

**Halotherapy** can loosen up the mucus in your lungs, sinuses, and throat. Salt has the capacity to thin out the mucus. It’s antifungal, antibacterial, and it’s also anti-mold. I’ve put links below to some machines that I think are good. (I’m not affiliated with the companies that make them.)

**Another option is to use something called a neti pot to wash out your sinuses with salt water.** Check your house for mold or mildew, which could be why your lungs are constantly filled with mucus. If you change locations, you might be surprised at how your sinus or lung condition goes away.

**From a nutritional standpoint, oregano oil is really good to treat mucus.**

## What Are The Underlying Reasons For Stomach Growling

# What are the underlying reasons for stomach growling?

You may have stomach sounds or stomach growling when you’re hungry, but hunger is not what’s causing it. Something called the migrating motor complex is what causes stomach growling. This is a certain housekeeping condition in your body where it’s cleaning out debris (extra food particles).

One really important function of the migrating motor complex is that it can prevent SIBO. SIBO is a condition where you have too much bacteria in your small intestine. The majority of bacteria should be in the large intestine. When bacteria get into the small intestine, you’ll start to be robbed of nutrients. You could also start to experience a lot of bloating from fermentation going on in your small intestine.

**How to stop stomach growling:**

• Eating (but if you have SIBO eating could increase bloating)

• Increase bile salts

• Decrease stress

• Fix SIBO (increase bile and take betaine hydrochloride)

• Do intermittent fasting

## What Should I Do If Im Experiencing Hunger And Frequent Cravings

# What should I do if I'm experiencing hunger and frequent cravings?

Many people worry about cravings when starting a ketogenic diet, but both keto and intermittent fasting can help eliminate them.

High insulin levels lower blood sugar, leading to cravings. Reducing insulin through a low-carb diet is key, as carbs trigger insulin release. While protein can also spike insulin if consumed excessively, it’s important to keep protein intake moderate. Increasing fat consumption is crucial, as fat does not affect insulin, and including plenty of vegetables is beneficial.

The transition from sugar-burning to fat-burning may come with cravings, often lasting about three days. To speed up this process, use electrolyte powder, B vitamins from nutritional yeast, and apple cider vinegar with meals.

If you still feel hungry despite following a low-carb diet, consider these factors:

\- Not practicing intermittent fasting

\- Consuming hidden carbs

\- Low dietary fat

\- Insufficient adaptation time

\- Eating low-nutrient foods

\- Insulin resistance

\- Low bile production

Addressing these issues can help manage cravings and improve your success on keto.

## What Additional Strategies Or Interventions Can Be Utilized To Improve 5F6Eb9

# What additional strategies or interventions can be utilized to improve skin health and overall condition, beyond traditional skincare routines?

For best results in reaping the many hyaluronic acid benefits, I recommend also applying it topically. Be sure to look for a product without alcohol and one specifically designed to penetrate deeper layers of the skin.

Simply wet your hands, place several drops of the product in your hands, and massage it well into your hands, face, and neck once or twice daily.

Along with supporting your skin's natural hyaluronic acid production through proper diet and targeted supplementation, consider other important aspects that can impact overall skin health.

- [Hydration](https://www.drberg.com/blog/6-common-mistakes-we-make-while-drinking-water) is key. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your skin hydrated from the inside out. Contrary to what some might believe, drinking too much plain water can dehydrate you and even lead to mineral depletion. Consider adding a pinch of sea salt to your water or opting for [electrolyte-rich drinks](https://www.drberg.com/blog/electrolyte-drinks).

- What you put in your body directly impacts what you see on the outside. Nutrition is crucial in supporting overall health, and this includes skin health. Consume a nutrient-dense, healthy diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, lean protein sources, healthy fats, and avoid processed foods and sugar.

## What Can You Do If You Need To Lower Bad Cholesterol Naturally

# What can you do if you need to lower bad cholesterol naturally?

There is one specific food that can really help you. Your body makes cholesterol. Excess cholesterol is eliminated through the bile ducts with the help of bile salts. Bile salts have a lot of important roles in the body. Typically, carbohydrates will increase cholesterol and triglycerides. There are three types of carbohydrates: sugar, starches, and fiber. Fiber can actually help reduce your cholesterol, but it has to be the right type of fiber. We’re talking about the fiber in vegetables. Vegetables have low amounts of sugar and high amounts of fiber. They’re also rich in nutrients, phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Fiber helps bind with cholesterol and modify the absorption of lipids and fats. It also increases the production of bile and eliminates bile connected to cholesterol. Fiber has zero effect on blood sugar and insulin, which will help lower your cholesterol. Feeding your microbes fiber also decreases the production of cholesterol. If you have high cholesterol, consume more vegetables to help increase the release of bile and feed the microbes. At the same time, be sure to avoid sugar and starch in your diet.

## What Steps Can Be Taken To Aid In The Dissolution Of Gallstones

# What steps can be taken to aid in the dissolution of gallstones?

**Worried about gallstones? Natural remedies might help!**

If you have a few gallstones, natural approaches could be worth exploring. Gallstones form when cholesterol becomes overly concentrated in your bile, lacking enough bile salts to keep it dissolved.

**Here's how to help dissolve gallstones naturally:**

1. **Increase Omega-3s:** Found in fatty fish and fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce cholesterol saturation in your bile. Cod liver oil is a great choice, offering the bonus of vitamins A and D.

2. **Supplement with Bile Salts:** Your body produces bile salts, but you can also take them in supplement form to help dissolve existing stones and prevent new ones from forming.

**Factors that may increase gallstone risk (and how to address them):**

- **High Insulin:** Reduce your intake of carbohydrates to help regulate insulin levels.

- **Elevated Cortisol:** Manage stress through relaxation techniques, exercise, and adequate sleep.

- **Estrogen Dominance:** If you suspect estrogen dominance, consult a healthcare professional to discuss ways to balance your hormones.

**Important Note:** While these natural remedies can be helpful, it's crucial to consult your doctor for diagnosis and to discuss the best treatment plan for your specific situation.

## Which Is Healthier Juice Or Soda

# Which is healthier: Juice or Soda?

While fruit juice seems like a healthy choice due to its natural origin, it's surprisingly similar to soda in sugar content. A 12-ounce serving of juice often packs more sugar than the same amount of soda!

Juice production strips away the beneficial fiber and oils found in whole fruit, leaving behind a highly refined product. Artificial flavors are often added, and the pasteurization process destroys valuable nutrients and beneficial microbes.

Non-organic juices may also contain pesticide residues. Moreover, the high sugar content in juice, without the accompanying vitamins and minerals, forces your body to deplete its nutrient stores.

Even popular apple juice is often made from concentrate, stored for long periods, and shipped globally before being reconstituted.

In the end, both soda and juice are unhealthy choices. If you're craving juice, opt for the whole fruit instead.

A better alternative is a fruit smoothie, which retains live enzymes, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants without pasteurization. For a soda fix, consider sugar-free options like Zevia, or simply enjoy refreshing water with electrolytes.

## Do Gelatin And Hydrolyzed Collagen Products Contain Monosodium Glutamate Msg

# Do gelatin and hydrolyzed collagen products contain monosodium glutamate (MSG)?

Hydrolyzed collagen and gelatin contain MSG (monosodium glutamate) or create MSG during processing. The chemical breakdown of gelatin and hydrolyzed proteins like collagen releases glutamic acid, which then combines with sodium to form MSG. Gelatin, derived from collagen, also contains significant amounts of free glutamic acid that can be considered MSG.

If you are using or considering using hydrolyzed collagen or gelatin for hair growth and you are reactive to MSG, topical biotin, and consumption of trace minerals and natural plants, herbs, and roots such as saw palmetto, horsetail herb, and ginseng may be a better solution.

## What Causes Hives And Itchiness Urticaria

# What causes hives and itchiness-urticaria?

**Understanding Itchiness, Hives, and Bile Salts**

Itchiness and hives can sometimes be linked to low bile salt levels. Here's why:

- **Bile's Role in Digestion:** Your liver produces bile, which is stored and concentrated in your gallbladder. When you eat, your gallbladder releases bile into your small intestine. Bile works with enzymes to break down fats and absorb essential vitamins and fatty acids from your food.

- **Bile Release and Stomach Acid:** Adequate stomach acid (a specific pH level) is needed to trigger bile release.

**Conditions Linked to Itchiness, Hives, and Low Bile Salts:**

- **Acid Reflux and GERD:** These digestive issues can interfere with proper bile release.

- **Gallbladder Removal:** Without a gallbladder to store bile, its release could be disrupted.

- **Liver Dysfunction:** Liver problems can impair bile production.

- **High Cholesterol and Gallbladder Stones:** These conditions may affect bile flow and function.

**Potential Remedies for Low Bile Salts:**

- **Purified Bile Salts:** Bile Salt Supplements

- **Healthy Ketosis and Intermittent Fasting:** These dietary approaches should be discussed with a healthcare professional to see if they could improve bile production and function.

## If I Have Inherited Fatty Liver Is It Advisable To Take Choline Alongs C330F7

# If I have inherited fatty liver, is it advisable to take choline alongside other supplements and food?

When considering hereditary issues related to fatty liver, various metabolic problems can contribute to fat accumulation in the liver. If you suspect this is the case, you’re on the right path, as choline is essential for liver health. A deficiency in choline can lead to the development of fatty liver, so it's beneficial that you are supplementing it. Whether you take choline with meals is a minor consideration; however, taking all vitamins with meals can enhance their absorption.

In addition to choline, there are three other important strategies to consider. First, incorporate probiotic-rich foods, such as sauerkraut, into your diet. These foods support the growth of beneficial microbes, which play a role in bile salt production. Adequate bile salts are crucial for breaking down cholesterol processed by the liver, as the primary method of cholesterol elimination is through the bile ducts. Ensuring sufficient bile salt production can greatly benefit liver function.

## What Are The Health Benefits Of Lemons And How Do They Contribute To O Fe467F

# What are the health benefits of lemons, and how do they contribute to overall well-being?

Many people know fresh lemons contain citrates, which lower the risk of kidney stones. They may also know that lemons are rich in vitamin C. But another secret weapon lemons have is called flavonoids. Flavonoids have powerful, wide-ranging effects.

One specific flavonoid in lemons can help remove fat from the liver, balance lipids in the liver, and support healthy blood sugar levels. It also helps protect the integrity of the capillaries.

**Other potential health benefits of lemons:**

• They may help with bleeding gums

• They help support peripheral circulation

• They may help with hyperglycemia

• They may help improve HDL

• They may help lower LDL

• They may help lower the risk of chronic venous insufficiency

• They contain potent anti-inflammatory compounds and may help with arthritis, fibrosis, and clotting

• They may help decrease glycation

• They may help reduce insulin resistance

• They have a profound effect on diabetic cardiomyopathy

• They are neuroprotective

• They have antimicrobial properties

To maximize the benefits of consuming lemons, you can make a simple drink using the whole lemon rather than just lemon juice. Try blending one whole lemon with 12 ounces of water and a few drops of stevia or my Electrolyte Powder for a delicious, healthy lemon drink. You can also add apple cider vinegar for additional benefits. For best results, enjoy this drink in the mornings.

## What Your Urine Color Says About Your Health

# What Your Urine Color Says about Your Health

**What Your Urine Color Means**

Urine is filtered blood. Your kidneys work to recycle essential substances while removing waste products as urine. Here's what your urine color might indicate:

- **Clear:** You're likely overhydrated. Proper hydration means balancing electrolytes with the right water intake. Drink when thirsty, especially during exercise or when sweating.

- **Normal Colors:** Aim for amber, yellow, or straw-colored urine. The yellow comes from a blood pigment.

- **Red/Pink:** Often means blood is present. Seek medical advice as this can indicate kidney stones, infections, menstruation, or more serious concerns.

- **Orange/Fluorescent Yellow:** Usually caused by vitamins (especially B vitamins), certain medications, or food dyes. Rarely, it might signal liver or gallbladder issues.

- **Blue/Green:** Could be due to dyes in food or medications, or medical conditions. Asparagus can sometimes turn urine green!

- **Dark Brown:** A sign of dehydration. Very dark brown urine could rarely indicate liver problems.

**Other Indicators**

- **Foamy Urine:** May mean high protein intake or, less commonly, kidney issues. Consider reducing protein and seeing if it improves.

- **Cloudy Urine:** Usually indicates an infection, like a UTI. Excess dietary sugar can contribute to UTIs.

## In What Specific Clinical Circumstances Or Medical Conditions Should T Dac198

# In what specific clinical circumstances or medical conditions should the use of bile salts be contraindicated due to potential adverse effects?

Most people need bile salts. Usually, they’re not producing enough. 

**What are bile salts?** Bile salts are made by the liver and are stored in the gallbladder. When the gallbladder stores the bile salts, it concentrates them. Bile is a super-concentrated mixture to help break down fats so you can extract fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids from your food.

We make about a quart of bile every day, and 90% of the bile is recycled. There are many benefits of bile. It is also necessary to help a person detoxify chemicals. You can take purified bile salts to help digest fats and prevent gallstones. 

**When not to take bile salts:**

1\. If you have diarrhea 

2\. If you have a hyperthyroid condition

3\. If you have bile malabsorption 

**What to do if you’re body is making too much bile, or you have too much bile:**

• Lower the amount of fats in your diet to about 60g per day (not any lower)

## What Are The Key Physiological Functions And Benefits Of Bile Salts In Ec378E

# What are the key physiological functions and benefits of bile salts in digestion and nutrient absorption?

The gallbladder is very important. It helps you store and concentrate bile salts. Your liver and friendly bacteria also make bile. About 95-97% of all the bile the body makes is actually recycled.

Typically, when people take bile salts as a supplement, they take them with a meal or just after they eat. Bile salts can help with bloating, belching, burping, and nausea. The primary function of bile salts that most people know of is the extraction of fat-soluble vitamins from the fat in your diet. However, there are many other benefits of purified bile salts. There are also benefits of taking them on an empty stomach.

For the benefits of bile salts below, I believe it may be best to take them on an empty stomach. I would take one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

**9 potential benefits of purified bile salts:**

1\. Bile salts can help decrease the risk of gallstones

2\. Bile salts can help you extract fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, D, and K) and omega-3 fatty acids

3\. Bile salts can help with constipation

4\. Bile salts can help you convert thyroid hormones

5\. Bile salts can act as a VDR agonist

6\. Bile salts can help decrease pain

7\. Bile salts can help reduce the risk of SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth)

8\. Bile salts can help reduce liver inflammation

9\. Biles salts can help reduce the toxic load and help regulate excess cholesterol

## What Physiological And Dietary Factors Contribute To The Enhancement O 3B83Bc

# What physiological and dietary factors contribute to the enhancement of bile salt synthesis and secretion?

Bile is made in the liver and then stored in your gallbladder.

The purpose of your gallbladder is to concentrate the bile to make digesting fats effectively, thus allowing your body to extract fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids from the fat you eat. If you don’t have a gallbladder, bile simply trickles from your liver into your intestine and is less effective.

Bile also helps lubricate your colon, and it kills certain bad bacteria along with helping you maintain microbial health.

**Here are the ten things you can consume to increase bile production, even if you don’t have a gallbladder:**

1\. Beet tops

2\. Ginger

3\. Artichokes

4\. Lemon

5\. Dandelion

6\. Milk thistle

7\. Choline

8\. Turmeric

9\. Betaine

10\. Bile salts

## Keto Chocolate Seed Treat

# Keto Chocolate Seed Treat

Nuts are heavy on the gallbladder. So, I wanted to make a healthy treat that had a low amount of chocolate, and I didn’t want to use nuts. So, I used seeds instead. I used sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds.  Both sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds are packed with protein, fiber, healthy fats, and vitamins.

**Only eat these with a meal, NOT between meals.**  

**RECIPE:**

5 cups of seeds.

Use 2 1/2 cups of roasted salted sunflower seeds and 2 1/2 cups of roasted salted pumpkin seeds.

9 ounces of Lily's chocolate chips. You could use Simply Lite Chocolate (3 bars) with maltitol but it can create more digestive gas for some people.

1-3 tbs of coconut oil.

1 tsp of vanilla extract.

Sea salt (pinch) if your seeds are not salted

**Directions:**

Melt chocolate and coconut oil

Mix in chocolate and oil to seed mix 

Add vanilla extract and salt if needed

Spread over a tray with parchment paper

Put in freezer for 15 minutes to 1 hour

**Enjoy!**

## What Steps Should I Take To Manage An Autoimmune Disease Considering T 46Bf73

# What steps should I take to manage an autoimmune disease, considering treatment options, lifestyle changes, and potential multidisciplinary care?

Autoimmune disease is a condition in which your body is attacking itself.

This means your immune system attacks your body’s own healthy tissues, similar to the body having an allergy to itself. Dr. Royal Lee was a famous nutritionist in the early 20th century. He discovered something known as PMG(proto morphogen), which worked to improve autoimmune disease symptoms.

Dr. Lee took the cells from another species’ thyroid and extracted the DNA using sea salt. He found that the DNA from this thyroid was very similar to ours.

If you consume the PMG (thyroid extract) orally and process it through your stomach, the antibodies that are attacking your thyroid will attack this decoy instead.

This allows you time to deplete the antibody reserve, so you no longer have any destructive attacks on your thyroid. If you have an autoimmune condition, PMGs or a glandular extract for a specific organ can help improve your symptoms over time.

## When Is The Optimal Time To Take Probiotics To Maximize Their Effectiveness

# When is the optimal time to take probiotics to maximize their effectiveness?

Probiotics are microbes. Microbes are a crucial part of our world. They convert carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur into forms that living things can use. We have ten times more microbes living on and inside our bodies than we have cells.

**Microbes have many functions and help us in various ways, including:**

• Helping to make nutrients available

• Providing immune protection

• Protecting against pathogens

• Supporting detoxification

• Improving digestion

• Helping to make vitamins

Strong hydrochloric acid in the stomach can kill a good portion of microbes. Bile salts also affect the microbiome. But, some microbes are resilient and can even live without oxygen.

**How to support the survival of probiotics in the stomach:**

1\. Take a probiotic supplement or consume probiotic foods at the end of your meal

2\. Consume probiotics earlier in the day

3\. If fasting, drink more water with your probiotics

4\. Don’t take probiotics with lemon water or apple cider vinegar water

5\. Consume raw plants grown in soil

## Can I Take Branched Chain Amino Acids On Keto And If While Exercising

# Can I take branched chain amino acids on Keto and IF while exercising?

This will spike insulin, but it's a minor point since the insulin spike is small. The real question is WHY are you taking it in the first place.

If you are taking it for recovery, then realize that those amino acids take several hours before they are turned into protein and you would be much better off taking B-vitamins (nutritional yeast) and minerals (electrolytes), since they are the cofactors or helps in the repair of muscles and the creation (synthesis) of muscle.

If you are taking BCAA to build muscle realize that intermittent fasting, in general, will already give you a protein-sparing effect and this protects you from the loss of protein. Growth hormones are spiked too, which helps with this.

Autophagy also occurs which is the recycling of proteins from the cell, thus reducing the need for taking extra protein.

## What Techniques Can Quickly Reduce Blood Pressure And How Do They Help Fa92D6

# What techniques can quickly reduce blood pressure, and how do they help regulate hypertension?

High blood pressure, a prevalent condition, can significantly impact your overall health. Grasping its intricacies is key to effective management. Let's delve into the causes and strategies to control blood pressure levels.

Your autonomic nervous system plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure. Stress can trigger an increase, leading to elevated systolic and diastolic readings, indicating the force exerted by your heart during and between beats.

Controlled breathing exercises offer a natural way to manage blood pressure. The "5-Second Breath Rule," involving slow and deliberate inhales and exhales, signals your autonomic nervous system to relax, potentially reducing blood pressure.

Incorporating breathing exercises into your bedtime routine can enhance sleep quality. Consistent practice fosters relaxation and promotes better rest, ultimately contributing to blood pressure management.

Beyond breathing, lifestyle changes are pivotal. A balanced diet low in salt and rich in whole foods, coupled with regular physical activity, can significantly impact blood pressure regulation. Dietary approaches like keto and intermittent fasting may also aid in managing hypertension.

Additionally, turmeric, known for its anti-inflammatory properties, has shown potential in lowering blood pressure. Its active compound, curcumin, may influence blood pressure regulation.

By understanding the causes of high blood pressure and adopting a holistic approach encompassing breathing exercises, dietary adjustments, physical activity, and lifestyle changes, you can empower yourself to achieve better blood pressure control and overall well-being.

## What Are Effective Approaches And Treatments For Managing Chronic Stom 6D120F

# What are effective approaches and treatments for managing chronic stomach issues, and how can they help alleviate symptoms and improve digestive health?

For managing chronic stomach issues, I recommend the following approach:

1\. **Adopt a Ketogenic Diet**: This can improve digestion by reducing inflammation and balancing gut bacteria. Additionally, incorporating bile salts can help open the ducts between the liver and small intestine, enhancing bile flow, which aids in lubrication and digestion, and preventing the buildup of sludge that can cause discomfort.

2\. **Consider SIBO or Inflammation**: If the ketogenic diet does not resolve your digestive issues, it may be due to Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) or inflammation. In such cases, switching to a carnivore diet temporarily can help reduce symptoms by eliminating potential irritants and providing a nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory diet.

By following these steps, you can address common underlying causes of chronic stomach issues and improve your digestive health.

## How Do I Integrate Epsom Salt In My Diet

# How do I integrate Epsom salt in my diet?

Epsom salt is a naturally occuring mineral salt that has some pretty good antimicrobial and antifungal properties. Overall it’s a very effective and beneficial substance.

**Benefits**

1. Antimicrobial

2. Antifungal

3. Especially good for toenail fungus

4. Epsom salt for toenail fungus

Dissolve two tablespoons of Epsom salt into four cups of water in a bucket. You can boil the water first, although you don’t have to. The main thing is to get the salt dissolved. Keep the water warm, but if you’ve boiled it first be sure to let it cool down to a comfortable temperature.

Soak your feet in this mixture daily for fifteen minutes. Do it for three to four weeks. You’ll see a great improvement. Also use a nail file to get rid of some of the dead toenail because the problem is that the fungus tends to get up underneath the nail and destroys it.

Depending on how infected the nail is, you may find that your dead nail has to come off and then regrow. Or if the infection isn’t too deep, new toenail tissue may just grow to replace the old.

## What Are The Potential Dangers Of Low Sodium Levels In The Body

# What are the potential dangers of low sodium levels in the body?

Hyponatremia is a situation where you’re losing a lot of blood volume, which can result in low blood pressure and a lot of other problems.

**The symptoms of low sodium include:**

• Edema in the brain

• Headaches

• Nausea

• Muscle cramps

• Fainting

• Falling

• Loss of appetite

• Confusion

• Coma

• Cardiovascular disease

• Stroke

Many people believe salt is bad for them and they avoid using any salt in their food. The problem is that this can result in low sodium. You need at least 1-1.2 grams of sodium each day, or 2-5 grams of salt per day. Keep in mind that salt can be hidden in many foods. It’s important to find the right balance since too much and too little can have adverse effects.

Many people drink way too much water because they are convinced it’s healthy. Excessive water consumption can deplete minerals like sodium. Drink when you are thirsty—don’t force yourself to drink water.

## What Are The Nutritional Benefits Of The Bone Broth

# What are the nutritional benefits of the bone broth?

Bone broth, sometimes called stock, is a liquid made from boiling animal bones and connective tissue. It’s actually a really good thing to consume because you are getting a lot of electrolytes and nutrition without a lot of calories.

People usually eat a lot of muscle from an animal, but not the rest of the animal. They eat a lot of meat from chicken, beef, lamb, and pork. The problem with this is that muscle is very high in methionine, an amino acid, whereas bone broth provides glycine with a different amino acid profile.

Bone broth is actually a really good thing to consume because you are getting a lot of electrolytes and nutrition without a lot of calories.

**Benefits:**

1. Can help with sleep

2. Can help lower blood sugars

3. Can help build up neurotransmitters in the body

4. Supports your gut

5. Supports your joints

**Simple bone broth recipe**

1\. Get three pounds of bones, preferably from a farmer’s market.

2\. Put two gallons of water in a pot, then add the bones.

3\. Add two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and let everything sit for 30 minutes so the acid can help break down the minerals in the bones.

4\. You can add herbs, spices, vegetables and sea salt.

5\. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 12 to 24 hours.

6\. The longer the broth simmers, the more nutrients are extracted. Your goal is to extract minerals, nutrients, collagen and amino acids from the bones.

7\. Let it all cool, then strain the solids from the liquid broth. Store the broth in glass jars.Use it in soups and stews.

**Where to get it**

You can also buy pre-made bone broth in a grocery store or order it online, for example the broth from a company called Kettle and Fire. They use animals that are grass-fed, pasture-raised and organic. They offer several flavors with excellent ingredients and no sugar or fillers. Their products are very keto-friendly.

## What Are The Possible Causes Of An Irregular Heartbeat

# What are the possible causes of an irregular heartbeat?

An irregular heartbeat can take many forms: slow heart rates, fast heart rates or skipped heartbeats. These are often known as arrhythmias (if they are persistent) or palpitations (if they are not chronic but happen from time to time).

**Cause #1: Gallbladder issues**

Gallstones, bile sludge, and bile duct blockages can cause heart palpitations. Based on an interesting study it was revealed that because of overload and inflammation in the gallbladder, certain signals through your body alter your healthy heart function. One of the best ways to fix this is to reduce the load of the gallbladder by doing intermittent fasting. It will reduce the load on your digestive system.

**Cause #2: Low electrolytes**

Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that allow the muscles to contract and relax and the nerves to transmit communications throughout the nervous system. The heart is made up of muscle tissue, so if your electrolytes are low you can develop palpitations.

**Cause #3: Alkalosis**

The pH of your blood is important for healthy heart function. If your pH is too high (alkaline), then you can develop a heart arrhythmia. Improving your pH will also increase the absorption of electrolytes in your body, which should normalize your heartbeat. The good thing is that it can be fixed very easily.

**Cause #4: Insulin resistance**

One of the insulin functions is to allow your cells to absorb electrolytes. When you are on a high-carb diet you can develop insulin resistance. This happens because high carbs increase the production of insulin in order to lower the blood sugar. When this occurs too often, your cells will not tolerate high insulin amounts anymore, and therefore become resistant to it. As a result, your cells absorb lesser amounts of electrolytes. The result can be irregular heartbeat.

Yes. Add Himalayan sea salt to your keto regime.

You need around 1 to 2 tsp of salt per day. This depends on your activity level. If you sweat a lot, this can increase your need for sodium. If you’re on keto, you want a bare minimum of 1 tsp of salt a day. This is because, as you lose fat, you also lose water weight and electrolytes. Salt is a vital electrolyte.

Himalayan salt is actually very different from standard sea salt. Here’s why. Although both Himalayan salt and sea salt have trace minerals, generic sea salt also has microplastics. One study found that 90% of sea salt products had small amounts of plastics. However, Himalayan salt has zero microplastics. Why? Himalayan salt is sourced from an ancient sea that existed before humans and pollution.

## Is It Possible To Follow A Ketogenic Diet Without A Gallbladder

# Is it possible to follow a ketogenic diet without a gallbladder?

Yes.

With the keto diet, 75% of your calories are coming from fat. The purpose of the gallbladder is to store and concentrate bile, which is the detergent that breaks down fats. Foods, especially fats, trigger the release of bile. Bile helps absorb fat-soluble vitamins, essential fatty acids, etc.

Without a gallbladder, you could have incomplete fat digestion or a deficiency in important fat-soluble vitamins.

You could try taking Dr. Berg’s Gallbladder Formula (see drberg.com) if you don’t have a gallbladder, to get more purified bile salts. This could potentially help you have enough bile to support complete digestion. You may also want to do intermittent fasting along with the keto diet.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## What Are The Common Causes Of Constipation And How Do Factors Such As  2886F3

# What are the common causes of constipation, and how do factors such as diet, hydration, and medical conditions contribute to this issue?

Constipation can stem from various factors, each with specific remedies:

1\. **Poor Gut Microbiome:**

\- **Cause:** Imbalance in gut bacteria affects food digestion.

\- **Remedies:** Take probiotics and eat fermented foods like sauerkraut and yogurt.

2\. **Low Bile:**

\- **Cause:** Insufficient bile leads to poor fat digestion.

\- **Remedies:** Use purified bile salts, increase saturated fats, and try gallbladder acupressure.

3\. **Low Stomach Acidity:**

\- **Cause:** Reduced stomach acid impairs nutrient breakdown.

\- **Remedies:** Take apple cider vinegar and betaine hydrochloride before meals.

4\. **Excess Fiber:**

\- **Cause:** Too much fiber, especially from grains, can worsen constipation.

\- **Remedies:** Avoid extra fiber, focus on improving digestion, slowly reintroduce fiber, and consider adding fruits.

Other factors include high fat intake, nut consumption, lactose intolerance, sensitivity to casein or certain vegetables, imbalance from excessive water intake without electrolytes, and stress.

These targeted remedies aim to enhance digestive function and gut health. Consult with healthcare providers for personalized advice.

## Should I Take Bcaas On Intermittent Fasting And Keto While Exercising

# Should I take BCAAs on Intermittent fasting and Keto while exercising?

This will spike insulin, but it's a minor point since the insulin spike is small. The real question is WHY are you taking it in the first place.

If you are taking it for recovery, then realize that those amino acids take several hours before they are turned into protein and you would be much better off taking B-vitamins (nutritional yeast) and minerals (electrolytes), since they are the cofactors or helps in the repair of muscles and the creation (synthesis) of muscle.

If you are taking BCAA to build muscle realize that intermittent fasting, in general, will already give you a protein-sparing effect and this protects you from the loss of protein. Growth hormones are spiked too, which helps with this.

Autophagy also occurs which is the recycling of proteins from the cell, thus reducing the need for taking extra protein.

## What Foods Should I Eat To Make Fasting Easier

# What foods should I eat to make fasting easier?

When you’re fasting, anything you consume other than water will break your fast to some degree. But, some food items you can consume will have a very minor effect on your ability to get back into fasting. The biggest things that will break your fast are refined carbs or sugar.

Making sure you have enough nutrients while fasting is critical, as this will make it easier. Some things you can consume to make fasting easier are MCT oil (can add it to coffee), electrolytes (be sure there are no added sugars), probiotics, B vitamins, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, sea salt, amino acid blends, and kombucha tea.

## How Can I Avoid Compromising My Training While Fasting And What Should 57Edbf

# How can I avoid compromising my training while fasting and what should I consume after a fast?

Fasting can actually enhance recovery from exercise by countering some of the damage caused by physical activity. Exercising in a fasted state may offer additional benefits, and monitoring your recovery through sleep quality, soreness, or heart rate variability can be helpful.

After a short fast (1-2 days), there's little risk in what you consume post-fast, especially if you've been eating well. However, for longer fasts (3-5 days), be cautious when reintroducing carbohydrates, as a rapid intake can cause an electrolyte imbalance. It's best to break a prolonged fast with smaller portions of food to ease your body back into normal eating.

## What Common Mistakes Should Be Avoided When Drinking Water To Ensure O 43A6Ad

# What common mistakes should be avoided when drinking water to ensure optimal hydration and health?

**Myth #1:** Once you feel thirsty, dehydration has already set in Truth: While feeling thirsty is a sign that your body needs more fluids, it does not necessarily mean you are dehydrated. Your body is designed to give you signals when you need more water, so just drink when you feel thirsty.

**Myth #2:** Drink water until your urine is clear Truth: Your urine should be a pale straw color or light yellow. If it's too clear, it means you are overhydrated; if it is too dark, it could indicate a potential health issue with your liver or kidneys.

**Myth #3:** Drink water to feel full and reduce food intake Truth: While replacing sugary drinks with water can help you lose weight, drinking more water does not directly lead to fat loss.

**Myth #4:** Drinking more water will flush out toxins Truth: Most toxins are fat-soluble and are not flushed out by drinking water alone. The body has its own detoxification system, so just focus on staying hydrated instead of trying to "detox" with excessive water intake.

**Myth #5:** Water will prevent dehydration Truth: While it is true that hydration is vital for overall health, simply drinking water will not prevent dehydration. Other factors, such as electrolytes play an important role in preventing dehydration.

**Myth #6:** Drink more water Truth: Drinking massive amounts of water can lead to imbalances in the body. Certain situations will call for more water intake—just don't overdo it. If you're prone to kidney stones, you need at least 2.5 liters of fluid per day

**Myth #7:** Drink water right before you eat Truth: Drinking water before meals is fine, but it may cause discomfort for individuals who experience heartburn or bloating.

**A few more key points to remember:**

• If you're prone to kidney stones, consider adding lemon to your water.

• Add a little bit of baking soda to your water if you experience gout symptoms.

• The keto flu or fatigue experienced by some individuals on a keto diet is often due to not consuming enough electrolytes with their water, specifically salt.

• Proper hydration is vital for kidney health, but drinking more water won't cleanse or "flush out" the kidneys.

## What Strategies Can Be Employed To Naturally Boost Growth Hormone Leve 386175

# What strategies can be employed to naturally boost growth hormone levels as you age?

In adults, growth hormone is essential for muscle building, fat burning, and overall health, including joints and bones. Aging leads to declining levels, affecting muscle, cognition, mood, and metabolic health.

Factors hindering growth hormone include insomnia, sleep apnea, high blood sugar, insulin, chronic stress, and liver issues. Rather than synthetic replacements, supporting natural production through methods like intense exercise, milk thistle for liver support, a Healthy Keto® diet, and intermittent fasting is recommended.

For ketogenic dieters experiencing muscle dehydration, adequate electrolyte-rich hydration and adjusting carb intake to around 50 grams per day from sources like berries can help maintain muscle health without refined carbs and sugars.

## What Are The Most Effective Foods Supplements And Smoothies For Suppor 647389

# What are the most effective foods, supplements, and smoothies for supporting liver detoxification and cleansing?

The liver doesn’t hold or store toxins—it gets rid of toxins. When we’re talking about a liver cleanse, we’re talking about getting rid of fat, inflammation, and scar tissue in the liver. These things weaken the ability of the liver to detox. The liver is the only organ that can completely regenerate, but there is a point of limitation.

Keep in mind that you can get rid of 50 percent of the fat in the liver just by going on a low-carb diet. You don’t need to get on a low-fat diet, but a low-carb diet is crucial. Alcohol consumption can lead to fatty liver disease. But, one of the top causes of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is fructose.

**The best foods for liver detoxification:**

• Cruciferous vegetables

• Beets

• Blueberries

• Organ meats

• Grass-fed beef

• Eggs

• Fatty fish (salmon and sardines)

• Seafood

• Sauerkraut

• Kimchi

• Kefir

• Pickles

**The best shakes and smoothies for liver detoxification:**

1\. One cup of blueberries blended with a couple of handfuls of frozen kale and some water

2\. One to two cups of whole milk kefir blended with one cup of blueberries and water (optional)

**The best drink for liver detoxification:**

1\. Two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with the juice of one lemon (or one blended whole lemon) and 12 ounces of water

**The best supplements for liver detoxification:**

• Milk thistle

• Choline

• Turmeric

• Purified bile salts

• Probiotics

• Tocotrienols

## What Are The Natural Sources Of Lutein And What Strategies Can Be Empl A11Bde

# What are the natural sources of lutein, and what strategies can be employed to optimize its absorption in the body?

**Lutein benefits your eyes and brain, so include lutein-rich foods in your diet.**

**Leafy Greens: Lutein Powerhouses**

Leafy greens like kale, spinach, collard greens, and Swiss chard are packed with lutein. Just one cup of cooked kale provides over 20 milligrams. Other good sources include yellow and orange peppers, corn, peas, and egg yolks.

**Enhance Absorption with Healthy Fats**

Lutein is fat-soluble, so pair it with healthy fats like avocado, nuts, seeds, or olive oil. For example, add olive oil to kale salad or sauté spinach in coconut oil for better absorption.

**Tips for Gallbladder Issues**

If you have gallbladder issues or have had it removed, consider supplements with bile salts and digestive enzymes to improve lutein absorption. Always consult with a healthcare expert for personalized advice.

## Can Toothpaste Be Considered A Viable Therapeutic Intervention For Acn 26C514

# Can toothpaste be considered a viable therapeutic intervention for acne management?

Toothpaste is formulated for your teeth, not your skin. There are actually several ingredients in toothpaste that are not good for your skin.

**A few of these ingredients are:**

1\. Sodium bicarbonate This is very alkaline and can irritate your skin. It can also disrupt the natural bacteria of your skin.

2\. Sodium lauryl sulfate This can be too harsh on the skin. It can remove the oil layer and can cause irritation or even a rash.

3\. Triclosan This may make your bacteria resistant to antibiotics.

4\. Fluoride This could create a condition called fluoroderma, which actually looks like acne. If you want nice skin, don’t put toothpaste on it.

**Instead, try these four things:**

• Lower your carbs (get on the healthy keto diet)

• Do intermittent fasting

• Take probiotics

• Avoid dairy

## How To Choose The Right Peanut Butter

# How to choose the right peanut butter?

Peanuts don't typically cause health issues, but they can cause bloating for some people, and it's still important to consume the right peanuts. Peanuts are not nuts—they are legumes that grow in the soil. Conventional peanuts are heavily sprayed with pesticides and fungicides, which seep into the soil and penetrate their thin shells. This is why you should always choose organic peanuts and peanut butter. Glyphosate is also commonly found in peanuts. Glyphosate can act as an antibiotic and is found in many GMO foods.

Always read the label on your peanut butter and ensure it doesn't contain hydrogenated oils. Hydrogenated vegetable oils don’t actually come from vegetables at all—they’re seed oils! Also, avoid peanut butter with added sugar.

Monoglycerides are sometimes added to peanut butter. A French study linked this ingredient to cancer and found that it can increase the risk of certain cancers by 46%. Look for peanut butter that only contains peanuts and salt. Organic Valencia peanut butter that contains only Valencia peanuts and sea salt is the best option. Valencia peanuts contain the least amount of aflatoxins. Aflatoxins come from mold and can be very damaging to the liver. Try to have your peanuts with a meal rather than as a snack to avoid spiking insulin.

## Why Does Removing Your Gallbladder Makes You Fat

# Why does removing your gallbladder makes you fat?

Removing your gallbladder can lead to weight gain for several reasons, mainly due to the important role of bile, a substance concentrated and stored in the gallbladder, in various bodily functions.

Thyroid Hormone Conversion:

Bile is essential for converting thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism. Without enough bile, the conversion process is hampered, potentially slowing down your metabolism.

• Insulin Sensitivity: Bile helps maintain insulin sensitivity. A lack of bile can lead to increased insulin levels, contributing to weight gain.

• Gut Microbiome: A healthy gut microbiome is influenced by bile. Without sufficient bile, the balance of gut bacteria can shift, leading to weight gain.

Constipation:

Bile acts as a natural lubricant in the intestines. Without it, you might experience constipation and retain waste, adding to body weight.

• Bloating: A deficiency in bile can cause bloating and swelling in the belly area, making you feel and look heavier.

• Fatty Liver: Bile helps prevent fatty liver, a condition linked to weight gain. Without enough bile, the risk of developing fatty liver increases.

To mitigate these effects, supplementing with bile salts can be beneficial, especially for those without a gallbladder. Bile salts can help replicate some of the gallbladder's functions, aiding in digestion and preventing some of the weight gain associated with gallbladder removal.

## Is Coffee With Sugar Safe To Drink Long Term

# Is coffee with sugar safe to drink long term?

**Why the Sugar and Caffeine Combo is Bad for Chronic Fatigue**

Combining sugar and caffeine in energy drinks can worsen chronic fatigue symptoms instead of providing relief. Here's why:

- **Sugar Overload:** Popular energy drinks are packed with alarming amounts of sugar, exceeding even Coca-Cola. This sugar rush causes a temporary energy spike followed by a crash, leading to low blood sugar symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, and irritability.

- **Nutrient Depletion:** Sugar in energy drinks lacks essential cofactors needed for energy production, forcing your body to deplete its nutrient reserves to metabolize the sugar.

- **Caffeine's False Energy:** Caffeine doesn't provide true energy but merely masks tiredness. High caffeine levels in energy drinks lead to increased stress hormones, dehydration, adrenal fatigue, and disrupted sleep – all detrimental to chronic fatigue sufferers.

- **Hidden Sugars:** Even seemingly healthier options like Celsius contain sucralose, an artificial sweetener that can negatively impact your body similar to sugar.

**The Better Solution**

Focus on sustainable energy sources by correcting your diet. Prioritize nutrient-dense foods, adequate electrolytes, and salt intake. This approach supports your body's natural energy production processes, promoting long-term well-being and combating chronic fatigue effectively.

## What Factors Contribute To A Decreased Appetite While Following A Keto 30Faf1

# What factors contribute to a decreased appetite while following a ketogenic diet and practicing intermittent fasting?

Some people experience a decreased appetite on the Healthy Keto® diet. Although you are taking energy from your body fat and don’t feel the need of food, it is important to note that food has an additional purpose--to provide nutrients. For example if you are deficient in electrolytes and you don’t eat, you can pass out, have low blood pressure etc. While you may not feel hungry because you’re burning enough fat to keep your body supplied with energy, you still need micronutrients.

**What to do:**

If you aren’t hungry for days at a time, it’s important to still eat a nutrient-dense meal once or twice a day. Make sure the meals that you eat are rich in nutrients. Lowering your fat intake may also help you regain your appetite.

- Don’t stop eating.

    - Eat one good meal per day if you want to lose weight

    - Eat two meals per day if you want to maintain your weight

- You can lower your fat intake gradually (to improve appetite)

- Avoid appetite blockers.

## What Are The Underlying Factors That Contribute To The Formation Of Ga B01B4B

# What are the underlying factors that contribute to the formation of gallstones?

Gallstones are really cholesterol stones. This situation isn’t really caused be consuming too much cholesterol. The real cause may be that you don’t have enough bile to break down cholesterol stones.  Bile is made in the liver and is stored in the gallbladder. Bile helps you dissolve fats in your diet. A low bile situation is actually a symptom of something else.

Low bile could be a symptom of:

• Excess estrogen 

• Excess cortisol 

• Excess insulin 

• Low-fat diets 

• Constipation 

To help dissolve the stones, you would want to increase your bile by pinpointing what’s causing the low bile situation and correcting your diet. In the meantime, bile salt also dissolves gallstones. 

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## What Strategies Improve Probiotic Survival In The Stomach And Boost Th 03Ea5B

# What strategies improve probiotic survival in the stomach and boost their effectiveness in digestion?

Probiotics are microbes. Microbes are a crucial part of our world. They convert carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur into forms that living things can use. We have ten times more microbes living on and inside our bodies than we have cells.

Strong hydrochloric acid in the stomach can kill a good portion of microbes. Bile salts also affect the microbiome. But, some microbes are resilient and can even live without oxygen.

How to support the survival of probiotics in the stomach:

1\. Take a probiotic supplement or consume probiotic foods at the end of your meal

2\. Consume probiotics earlier in the day

3\. If fasting, drink more water with your probiotics

4\. Don’t take probiotics with lemon water or apple cider vinegar water

5\. Consume raw plants grown in soil

## What Underlying Factors May Be Contributing To Persistent Belching

# What underlying factors may be contributing to persistent belching?

Belching is often related to gallbladder issues, particularly if you're taking bile salts. However, another important factor could be the enzyme TUDCA, a type of bile salt that helps maintain bile flow. If you're already taking bile salts with meals and still experiencing belching, consider these steps:

1\. **Enzymes**: Insufficient digestive enzymes can strain the pancreas, especially in those with insulin resistance. Eating raw foods may improve symptoms, indicating a need for more enzymes.

2\. **Stomach Acid**: Low stomach acid can cause belching. Supplementing with betaine hydrochloride may help increase stomach acid levels.

3\. **Probiotics**: Fermentation issues in the digestive system might also be a cause. Increasing probiotics can help balance gut flora and reduce belching.

Addressing these areas can help identify and manage the underlying causes of belching.

## What Could Be The Underlying Reasons For Experiencing Itchiness On My Face

# What could be the underlying reasons for experiencing itchiness on my face?

Pruritus is the medical term for itchiness, and there can be several underlying causes. One possibility is an issue with bile flow, where bile ducts become backed up, leading to the accumulation of bile salts in the bloodstream and subsequently causing skin irritation. In such cases, a supplement called TUDCA may help alleviate the problem.

Another potential cause of facial itchiness is an imbalance in the skin's microbial flora. Over-cleansing or using harsh detergents and soaps can disrupt the skin's microbiome, leading to irritation, rashes, or itchiness. It's important to approach skin cleansing gently and avoid excessive use of products that can compromise the skin's natural balance.

## What Are Effective Ways To Support Bile Flow

# What are effective ways to support bile flow?

The discomfort you’re experiencing may not originate from the gallbladder itself, but rather from the bile ducts, where thicker bile and cholesterol can create pressure and lead to pain.

To address this issue, it's important to promote bile flow. Incorporating choline into your daily regimen and taking bile salts with meals can help enhance bile production, facilitating a smoother flow through the ducts and alleviating discomfort. You may need a higher dosage than average to achieve optimal results.

During this time, it's advisable to avoid nuts, peanut butter, and dairy products. Moderate consumption of saturated fats from meat can actually stimulate bile production without worsening your condition. However, be cautious with coconut oil, vegetable oils, and fried foods high in omega-6 fatty acids, as these can exacerbate the problem. On the other hand, fatty fish like salmon should not aggravate gallbladder issues and can be beneficial.

## What Kind Of Beverages Can Help Me Battle Dehydration Providing A Norm D71E64

# What kind of beverages can help me battle dehydration providing a normal DV of electrolytes?

The best drink to avoid dehydration is electrolyte-enriched water. Electrolytes play a crucial role in facilitating fluid absorption into the body, and electrolyte imbalance can cause dehydration despite drinking plenty of fluids. 

However, it’s best to avoid pre-mixed electrolyte sports drinks with added sugar and instead use a sugar-free electrolyte powder to replenish electrolytes and avoid dehydration.

## Whats The Relation Between Extreme Hunger And Intermittent Fasting

# What's the relation between extreme hunger and intermittent fasting?

Hunger is a great indicator of whether you are doing intermittent correctly. If the hunger is too high and severe WITH additional blood sugar issues (dizziness, lightheadedness, irritability, sugar cravings, and brain fog), then you need to cut back and add a meal or add more fat with a meal.

The other thing to do is add electrolytes to your fasting period and some bone broth as this will make it easier to go from 1 meal to the next. If you just have some hunger and it's not too severe - ride the wave and keep going.

## What Causes Fever And What Are Some Natural Remedies To Handle It

# What causes fever and what are some natural remedies to handle it?

Fever is an increased body temperature. It is caused by your immune system as a way to fight internal infections. Let’s look at the common causes of fever and their remedies.

Symptoms

- High temperature

- Sweating

- Chills and shivering

- Headache

- Muscle aches

- Loss of appetite

- Irritability

- Dehydration

- General weakness

**Cause #1: Infection**

If your body is undergoing a viral or bacterial infection, this can trigger your immune system to create fever. Fever is a mechanism that helps your body to fight the harmful infection.

The solution would not be to suppress your fever with medication, but rather to strengthen your immune system and counter the virus with natural antibiotics. Fasting is one of the best ways to boost your immune system, and that will also speed up the process of getting your body back to normal.

**Cause #2: An autoimmune condition**

An autoimmune condition means your immune system is attacking your own healthy body cells. This can create inflammation and a fever as a result. Usually this stems from some kind of immune system confusion prior to that. Thus, strengthening your immune system as well as lowering the inflammation should help.

**Cause #3: Inflammatory condition**

If you have inflammation in some area of your body that is not going away, this in itself can cause a higher body temperature. Consuming foods that are inflammatory can cause this condition as well. The solution would be to reduce the inflammation.

## Can I Eat Chocolate On Keto Diet

# Can I eat chocolate on Keto diet?

Yes, in small amounts. Always consume chocolate that is organic and doesn’t contain sugar. A couple of brands are Lily’s Sweets and Choc Zero. Cacao and dark chocolate are high in oxalates. So if you’re at risk for kidney stones, you may not want to consume either one.

Potential health benefits of dark chocolate and cacao:

• Decreased blood pressure

• Increased HDL and decreased LDL (especially oxidized LDL)

• Decreased risk of heart disease (decreased endothelial dysfunction)

• Decreased cortisol and adrenaline

• Decreased risk of certain cancers

• Decreased insulin (may improve insulin resistance)

• Decreased risk of strokes

• Better mood and increased serotonin (it can act as an antidepressant)

• Increased physical performance

• Increased skin circulation, texture, hydration

• Decreased metabolic syndrome

## How Much Water Should I Drink On Keto

# How much water should I drink on keto?

It’s best to drink water only when you are thirsty. Water myths:

- 60% of the body is water – false

- The body doesn’t know when it’s thirsty – false

- Water flushes out fat – false

- Water flushes out toxins – false

- Water helps dry skin – false

The people who drink the most water are actually the most dehydrated because of the difference it makes in their electrolytes, since too much water can flush out the electrolytes you need in your body.

Hyponatremia is a condition where you can get really sick or even die because of drinking too much water.

Dr. Berg says he drinks about 2 to 3 cups of water a day.

Your body adjusts to maintain a natural balance. Just make sure to drink only when you’re thirsty.

## Should I Consume Turmeric

# Should I consume turmeric?

You can consume organic turmeric or take a supplement. If you want to take a supplement, it’s best to get a turmeric supplement and not just curcumin. Curcumin is only one of many phytonutrients in turmeric. It’s also important that it’s a freeze-dried supplement. Black pepper or white pepper can help you increase the absorption of turmeric. You can also consume a small amount of fat at the same time for better absorption. Keep in mind that the phytonutrients in turmeric are heat sensitive, so cooking with turmeric could make them less potent.

The two main areas of research for turmeric are inflammation and cancer. A lot of the direct benefits of turmeric can lead to various other powerful effects, and turmeric also has virtually no side effects.

**Potential health benefits of turmeric:**

1\. It increases glutathione and other antioxidant networks

2\. It has potent effects on the brain and nervous system

3\. It has powerful effects on the cardiovascular system

4\. It’s antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-candida, antifungal, antiparasitic, and anti-H. pylori

5\. It shows great benefits for skin problems

6\. It helps protect the liver

7\. It helps stimulate phase-2 detoxification

8\. It inhibits pro-carcinogens

9\. It increases bile salts

10\. It supports the gut mucosal lining

11\. It helps protect the DNA and supports DNA repair and apoptosis

12\. It protects the cells during chemo or radiation therapy and may increase the effectiveness of the treatment

13\. It supports the endocrine system

14\. It’s a powerful adaptogen

## How Much Water Do I Drink On Keto

# How much water do I drink on Keto?

Some people drink about 2 to 3 cups of water a day. Your body adjusts to maintain a natural balance. Just make sure only to drink when you’re thirsty.

But when fasting, you’re losing glycogen. With the glycogen loss (stored sugar), you’re also going to lose a lot of fluid. This fluid isn’t just water. It’s a combination of water, electrolytes and salts – which need to go back into the body.

It would be a good idea for someone to consume between 2 and 3 liters of water per day while fasting. This quantity could also help prevent kidney stones. You would want to be sure to add electrolytes and sea salt. Forgetting electrolytes and sea salt can potentially lead to keto fatigue, keto flu and overall weakness.

Make sure to consume water when you are thirsty only, to avoid overhydration with its problems.

## Why Do I Feel Nauseous On Keto

# Why do I feel nauseous on Keto?

This is usually a sign of liver or gallbladder problems. Try to consume purified bile salts and see if that helps.

Also, various kinds of sugar alcohol could cause digestive problems. Try to cut back on them and only use a small amount.

Adjust the vegetables you eat; maybe you need to switch to different ones due to sensitivity. You can consume fermented vegetables in this case as it may help.

Avoid dextrose and maltodextrin.

Sometimes people add too many fats on a ketogenic diet without getting used to the quantity gradually. This can cause nausea as well.

## Why Do I Have Increased Cholesterol On A Ketogenic Diet

# Why do I have increased cholesterol on a Ketogenic diet?

A fat cell is composed of triglycerides and cholesterol. You are losing weight, you are losing fat, and as you do that the fat cell breaks down. You can burn the triglycerides part of the fat for fuel, but not cholesterol. Cholesterol will be eliminated. So this spike in cholesterol is temporary and will go down.

If you are concerned about your cholesterol or LDL, you may want to request an advanced lipid panel which measures the particle size.

Continue to consume large amounts of veggies to help flush your liver and other organs while you’re on a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. Bile salts are also extremely helpful. Bile salts help to regulate excessive amounts of cholesterol so a lack of bile salts can keep your cholesterol high.

## When Should You Consider Lowering Your Dietary Fat Intake On A Ketogenic Diet

# When should you consider lowering your dietary fat intake on a ketogenic diet?

A high-fat diet is only bad if you are also consuming a lot of carbs. Keep in mind that the keto diet is not primarily a high-fat diet—it’s a low-carb diet. A diet that is high in fat and high in carbs is not a keto diet. I’ve also found that low-carb and low-fat diets are hard on the liver (especially with lean protein), which causes a lot of digestive issues.

You may want to lower your fat temporarily if you have gallbladder issues or a bile deficiency. Bile is vital to fat digestion. Taking purified bile salts, choline, or lipase can help with fat digestion. Another reason why you may want to lower your fat is if you’ve been on keto and your weight has plateaued. In this case, you can lower your fat to 75 grams per day. This will allow your body to tap into your own fat reserves.

## How Can I Address Body Odor While On Keto

# How can I address body odor while on Keto?

There are a few things that could cause an odor in your urine or breath, like:

- Liver damage

- Infection

- Dehydration

- Asparagus

- Too much protein

As you transition to keto and intermittent fasting your ketones are going to go up. There
are three types of ketones, but the one that creates the most detectable odor on breath and in urine is acetone. If your urine is darker, cloudy, and has a strong odor chances are it’s going to be acetone (not the nail polish remover; that is different). Your sweat and breath can also have a strong odor as a result.

Your body actually makes acetone as a natural consequence of consuming more fat and less carbohydrate. It is a normal thing and not a concern at all.

To get rid of the odor, increase chlorophyll in your diet. It is a deodorizer that comes from leafy greens. Increase your fluids, and not just by drinking water, but using electrolytes with your water to become more hydrated.

Lastly, as long as you are consistent with your diet, the odor will go away as your body gets adapted to ketosis.

We also recommend trying Dr. Berg's Electrolytes Powder drink. This drink is a perfect keto-friendly beverage! Here is the link: [https://shop.drberg.com/electrolyte-powder-raspberry-lemon-100-servings](https://shop.drberg.com/electrolyte-powder-raspberry-lemon-100-servings)

## Can Bile Salts And Ox Bile Thin Blood

# Can bile salts and ox bile thin blood?

While ox bile and bile salts are not anticoagulants, they have the potential to indirectly thin blood. While this effect is generally mild at typical supplement-suggested usage, individuals with bleeding disorders, those on anticoagulant medications, and those who are undergoing surgery should exercise caution and consult a healthcare provider before use.

---

## Are Electrolyte Drinks Good For You

# Are Electrolyte drinks good for you?

Yes, electrolyte-containing drinks are an excellent way to promote electrolyte balance, which is crucial for optimal hydration, energy production, muscle function, and maintaining the body’s pH balance. However, avoid sugary sports drinks that can cause weight gain and dehydration and opt for electrolyte-enriched water instead.

---

## Does Nutritional Yeast Contain Msg

# Does Nutritional Yeast contain MSG?

Nutritional yeast does not naturally contain MSG. Nutritional yeast will only contain MSG if added to the nutritional yeast.

All Dr. Berg Nutritionals' nutritional yeast products and those containing nutritional yeast are all-natural and do not contain MSG.

Nutritional yeast does contain naturally occurring glutamic acid but is not the same as the synthetic MSG used as a food additive.

Glutamic acid is an amino acid, one of the building blocks of proteins. In its natural form, glutamic acid is not harmful and is an essential component of our diet.

MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) is the sodium salt of glutamic acid. It is a synthetic compound produced through fermentation involving sugar beets, sugarcane, or starch. MSG is known for enhancing the savory or umami taste of foods. It is often used as a food additive to enhance the flavor of various dishes.

## Should I Be Worried About The Citric Acid In The Electrolyte Powder

# Should I be worried about the citric acid in the Electrolyte Powder?

There is no need to be concerned about the natural citric acid in our Electrolyte Powder products.

Not all citric acid is the same or creates the same effect. The adverse effects of citric acid depend on the source. The citric acid in the Electrolyte Powder is from the root vegetable cassava or tapioca. This source of citric acid is in a very low concentration. If we compare this to the artificially manufactured citric acid in junk foods - which is massive, there is a big difference in the adverse effects on the body.

Citric acid is vital to our health and is also made by our body. If you look at the Krebs cycle in the mitochondria, the first molecule that feeds the whole machine is citric acid.

## Why Can Stomach Problems Happen On Keto

# Why can stomach problems happen on keto?

Digestive issues on keto, like bloating and nausea, often stem from sugar alcohols and excessive fiber intake. Erythritol and xylitol can cause diarrhea, while too much fiber from veggies or keto products may overwhelm digestion. Opt for whole foods, avoiding synthetic sugars like dextrose and maltodextrin. Moderating MCT oil intake and gradually introducing new fats can help. Consider purified bile salts and betaine hydrochloride supplements. Apple cider vinegar aids digestion. Intermittent fasting can aid digestion by allowing breaks between meals. Limit nuts, peanut butter, almond flour, and cheese initially.

## Keto Quiche Recipe

# Keto Quiche Recipe

If you’re in a rush or maybe you even hate to cook, this quick and simple recipe is for you. You can make this keto-friendly quiche recipe in advance to enjoy later. You can also make the pie crust and egg mixture separately and freeze them both to have on hand.  You can double or triple this recipe to make a variety of quiches to freeze and have at any time of the day. What Karen Berg did, was made a large batch of the egg mixture, poured it into six different pie crusts, and then filled them with different things. You can really customize these however you’d like.

**The different keto-friendly quiches Karen Berg made are:**

• Chicken and sharp cheddar 

• Veggie 

• Bacon, onion, and cheddar 

• Ham and swiss

• Spinach and salmon 

• Cheese and sausage 

The crust for this quiche is not wheat. It’s made with almond flour. These crusts are also super fast and easy to make. 

**The secret if you want a quiche with different things in it: Cook the meat and saute the vegetables ahead of time, add those ingredients to the crust first, then pour the egg on top of that.** 

**Here’s how to make quiche at home:**

1\. Mix together 3 eggs, 1 cup of organic milk, 1/2 cup organic cream, and 1 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper, 1/2 tsp. chives

2\. Fill your keto-friendly pie crust with the cheese/veggies/meat of your choice. 

3\. Pour the wet ingredients into the pie crust 4. Bake at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes

## How Long Does Keto Breath Last

# How long does Keto breath last?

It can last from a few days up to 3 weeks. It is usually a sign of keto adaptation.

What you need to do is:

- Be strict with your carbs, bringing them below 20 grams per day

- Do intermittent fasting as this will speed things up and drop insulin

- Consume a little more fluid with electrolytes to encourage the body to release ketones out of the urine instead of in your breath

- Consume more foods with chlorophyll (in vegetables)

---

## Why Do I Still Have Acne On Keto

# Why do I still have acne on keto?

Normally, keto helps with acne by addressing underlying hormonal issues. Persistent acne may indicate high androgens, which increase skin oiliness. Androgens often rise due to high insulin levels, potentially from hidden sugars or artificial sweeteners. Implement intermittent fasting with your keto diet to help manage insulin levels.

Stress can also trigger cortisol release, spiking insulin and causing acne. Reduce stress by taking daily 45-minute walks, avoiding stress triggers, and consuming nutritional yeast.

To address acne, check food labels for hidden carbs or sugars, add healthy fats, consume purified bile salts, practice intermittent fasting, and eat 7 to 10 cups of vegetables daily. Additionally, consume probiotics or fermented vegetables. If stress is a problem, improve sleep, take naps, and continue with long outdoor walks.

## Do Soda Beverages Cause Dehydration

# Do soda beverages cause dehydration?

Yes, soda can dehydrate you. Soda is typically high in sugar and caffeine, which have diuretic properties and negatively impact the body’s ability to regulate fluid balance.

**Incorporating Celery Juice into Your Diet**

**Selecting Fresh Celery:** Opt for fresh, organic celery to ensure high-quality juice free from pesticides and chemicals.

For this recipe, I salted the tops of the hush puppies at the very end with sea salt to give them a little something extra. But, salt is actually very important for your health. This can be a great salty alternative to chips and other unhealthy salty foods. If you’re on keto, it’s important to consume 1 tsp. of sea salt per day.

- 4 Scallions

**Instructions:**

1\. Add Almond Flour and Baking Powder in a bowl

2\. Add Garlic Powder 

3\. Mix well

4\. Add Cheddar Cheese and egg

5\. Add Half and Half

6\. Mix

13\. Cook until golden 

**For Dipping Sauce:**  

2 tbsp. Mayo 

1/4 Cup Sour Cream 

1 tbsp. Chili Sauce (Like Sriracha)

1\. Add mayo, sour cream, chili sauce

## Keto Biscuits Recipe

# Keto Biscuits Recipe

A lot of people love to have a nice biscuit or piece of bread with butter. While on the ketogenic diet, you can have grass-fed butter, but traditional breads and biscuits are not an option. This is the perfect low-carb alternative if you’re on the keto diet, but you still want to have something that’s like bread or a biscuit. Put grass-fed butter on it or oil with Italian spices. They’re easy and delicious. 

These biscuits are very bread-like, so you could slice it for sandwiches or toast it! Yum! This recipe is for ONE biscuit. But you can easily double it, triple it, etc. - as much as you want and fill as many muffin cups as you like. Make enough, and you can even make a loaf. 

**Keto Biscuits Recipe:**

2 tbl ground flaxseed

1 egg

1 tsp Kerrygold butter ½ tsp baking powder

2 grinds (pinches) of salt

**Directions:**

Mix and put in greased ramekins/muffin cups/loaf pan. Bake at 350 for 15 minutes. When using a loaf pan, 25 minutes will be needed. Test with knife or toothpick, to see to it that it comes out clean and to ensure doneness.

## Keto Cranberry Pecan Muffins Recipe

# Keto Cranberry Pecan Muffins Recipe

These low-carb cranberry pecan muffins are amazing, and they are completely keto-friendly. There is no regular flour or sugar in this recipe. I like to use Kerrygold grass-fed butter on top. Even my kids love these delicious muffins, and I think you're going to love them too. 

The cranberries in this recipe are ok because cranberries are tart, they don't have a lot of sugar. You're also allowed between 20 and 50 grams of carbs per day with a ketogenic diet. You don't have to feel deprived on the ketogenic diet. Great recipes like this one are delicious and will even make the house smell great!

**Cranberry Pecan Muffins Recipe**

**Ingredients**

• ½ cup sour cream

• 4 large organic, pasture-raised eggs

• 1 tsp vanilla

• 3 cups almond flour

• ½ tsp cinnamon

• 2 tsp baking powder (aluminum-free)

• ½ cup sugar-free sweetener (I use Just Like Sugar)

• ¼ tsp salt

• 1 cup fresh or frozen/thawed cranberries (If frozen, they must be fully thawed and drained.)

• ½ cup pecans (nuts are optional)

**Directions**

1\. Preheat oven at 325°F. 

2\. Line the muffin tin with cups or use silicone liners.

3\. In a blender, mix sour cream, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, baking powder, sweetener, and salt. Blend until well-mixed. 

4\. Add almond flour mixture a bit at a time and blend. If it gets too thick, add water until it can blend into a batter. Mix well.

5\. Add cranberries and nuts and mix with a spatula. (If it's easier for you, you can pour the batter into a large bowl or mix the whole thing in a bowl. You'll still end up with yummy cranberry muffins.) 

6\. Using a ¼ cup or a spoon, pour the batter into the muffin cups, dividing the batter evenly into 12. 

7\. Bake for 25-30 minutes until the muffins are slightly brown and firm to touch. Let them cool at room temperature because warm muffins will stick to the paper.

## Healthiest Keto Cookies

# Healthiest Keto Cookies

The recipe for the healthiest cookies in the world:

**Ingredients**:

8 ounces (2 sticks) of butter (Organic -- or my favorite; Kerrygold Irish Butter)

4 Tbs. of xylitol (sweetener) (get on amazon.com or at the health food store)

2 cups of almond flour

2 cups of crushed pecans

1 chocolate bar (3.5 ounces) -- must be diabetic chocolate (I like Simply Lite® -- from Trader Joes)

1 pinch of sea salt

2 tsp. of vanilla extract

**Where to get:**

**Kerrygold butter:** most grocery stores, but Trader Joes, BJs, and health food stores have it. But any European butter or organic butter will work.

**Almond Flour:** most health food stores or on amazon.com

**Pecans:** you can find them at any grocery store, but on amazon.com they are less expensive.

**Xylitol:** you can find it at the health food store or amazon.com

**Simply Lite Chocolate:** Trader Joes or online.

**Directions:**

- Preheat oven at 325. Leave butter out of the refrigerator overnight -- must be soft. Mix the butter (8 ounces) with the xylitol (4 Tbs) with a mixer (or by hand) until very smooth. For time sake, mix with fork until a smooth consistency.

- Crush the pecans (in grinder, food processor or in a bag with a rolling pin). Make sure it's 2 cups after crushing.

- Breakdown (or grind) the chocolate bar (3.5 ounces) in a food processor or other means.

- Mix thoroughly the now sweetened butter, almond flour (2 cups), crushed pecans (2 cups), crushed chocolate bar, pinch of sea salt, 2 Tsp of vanilla extract in a bowl. You could, as an option, have your food processor mix it instead.

- Form little balls with your hands and roll them in some almond flour (to coat them), putting them on a cookie sheet with parchment paper.

- Cook for 13 minutes at 325 degrees, then let them sit out of the oven for 10 minutes.

- Transfer to the freezer until frozen. Then store them in the refrigerator.

Enjoy!!!!!!!!

**Mistakes:** 

1\. Let them completely cool down or they will crumble and disintegrate when you try to pick one up. I also put them in the freezer, make them solid and we're good to go. Consuming them cold and slightly frozen is much tastier than consuming them warm.

2\. I also found that using the "no sugar added" diabetic chocolate works better with milk chocolate, not dark chocolate.  

3\. Almond flour works better than almond meal.

4\. I also found that if you substitute crushed pecans with crushed macadamia nuts or crushed cashews (same amounts), it will add a different flavor, be very rich, and also crazy delicious. If you do this, make sure you do not add that pinch of salt, because macadamia nuts and cashews may already come with salt.

5\. Using vanilla extract.

6\. Leave the butter out of the refrigerator overnight.

You probably are not producing enough saliva. On keto specifically, you are not taking any starches (hopefully), and they make the body produce saliva. But another factor is electrolytes.
