## What Is Berberine Hcl In The Blood Sugar Support Advanced Formula

# What is Berberine HCL in the Blood Sugar Support Advanced Formula?

Berberine HCl (hydrochloride) in our Blood Sugar Support Advanced Formula is a form of berberine that’s easier for the body to absorb. Berberine is a natural compound found in plants and is often used to support healthy blood sugar levels and overall metabolic health. The “HCl” means it’s bound with hydrochloride to improve stability and absorption—it’s still the same active berberine.

## What Is The Most Effective Nutrient For Cancer Prevention And Treatmen 5440Cb

# What is the most effective nutrient for cancer prevention and treatment, and how does it inhibit tumor growth and support cellular health?

Sulforaphane is a phytonutrient that has been studied extensively. You can get sulforaphane from many different plants, but the best source of sulforaphane is broccoli sprouts or broccoli microgreens. Broccoli sprouts or broccoli microgreens have 10 to 100 times more sulforaphane than broccoli. The majority of nutrients in plants, especially phytonutrients, are in the early stages of growth. Sprouts and microgreens also have much fewer anti-nutrients, which can irritate the gut.

Sprouts and microgreens are incredibly nutritious and are great choices if you have a hard time consuming large amounts of vegetables. You can consume fewer of them to get a good amount of nutrients and phytonutrients.

**Potential benefits of microgreens and sprouts (sulforaphane):**

1\. May help prevent chronic disease

2\. Has potent anti-inflammatory effects

3\. May have anticancer effects

4\. May help inhibit carcinogens

5\. Has potent antimicrobial effects

6\. Has powerful blood sugar effects

7\. May be beneficial in preventing heart disease

8\. Has been studied for autism

9\. Has anti-aging effects

10\. Helps support the brain

## What Is Berberine

# What is berberine?

Berberine is a natural chemical in certain plants. Berberine is most known for helping to support healthy blood sugar levels and making insulin more sensitive. Berberine attacks insulin resistance, which is at the heart of most health problems like a fatty liver, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, and high LDL cholesterol. Anything that helps decrease insulin resistance will also help support weight loss.

## Interesting Facts About Sugar

# Interesting Facts About Sugar

1\. It’s not just the amount of carbohydrates that matters. It’s also the quality of the carbs. You have to consume less than 50 grams of net carbs per day to get into ketosis. But, there is a big difference between consuming 50 grams of sugar carbs vs. 50 grams of carbs in general. For example, 50 grams of carbohydrates from sugar would be equivalent to a twelve-ounce orange soda. But 50 grams of net carbs from vegetables is equivalent to about 42 cups of salad.

2\. The liver treats fructose like alcohol. Most types of sugar are really fifty percent glucose and fifty percent fructose. When you check your blood sugar, you’re really only looking at the glucose. Fructose doesn’t affect the blood sugar by that much. Instead, it affects the liver. Even though fructose doesn’t raise your blood sugar levels, it can create other serious issues. These issues can include a fatty liver, high triglycerides, high cholesterol, free radical damage, inflammation, insulin resistance, and diabetes.

3\. Just because it’s from beets doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Most of the sugar used in the US is from beets and is genetically modified, so there are traces of glyphosate. There is an in-depth process to produce beet sugar, and the end product is refined and overly processed.

4\. The chemistry of glucose is similar to vitamin C. This means that glucose and vitamin C are competitive to a certain degree. If you consume sugar, your body won’t absorb vitamin C.

## How Does Big Pharma Profit Off Of Sick People

# How does Big Pharma profit off of sick people?

There are over 100 clinical trials supporting that type 2 diabetes can be reversed in as little as 10 weeks. Hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and other chronic diseases can potentially also be reversed with dietary changes. The reversal rate of type 2 diabetes with the standard of care from doctors is 0.1%. In clinical trials with patients following a keto diet, the reversal rate is more than 50%!

Insulin manufacturers and other drug companies primarily fund the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association, so they are subject to direct conflicts of interest. Doctors have been taught to recommend low-fat diets, and there are countless baseless claims that keto is dangerous.

Dietary guidelines significantly influence most Americans. By law, all federal food programs are required to follow these guidelines. Health professionals also use them as the gold standard in nutrition. However, many conflicts of interest are involved in these guidelines, including ties to both Big Food and Big Pharma.

Giving accurate dietary guidelines to the American public is the best way to combat chronic disease.

To get into a healthy state of ketosis, you should eat eggs, dairy, meat, shellfish, vegetables, and low-sugar fruits. Carbohydrates trigger hunger. Without glucose, your body can access your fat stores for energy between meals.

## What Is The Most Inflammatory Food That I Should Never Consume

# What is the most inflammatory food that I should never consume?

There is a lot of debate over what the most inflammatory food is. Some people say meat, while others say it's the fiber in plants. Some people do well consuming fiber, and others don’t. Why? Humans can’t digest fiber. Your microbes are what break down fiber by fermenting it. While fiber is anti-inflammatory, unfermented fiber is inflammatory. If you don’t have enough of the right microbes in your gut, you could have more of an issue with fiber than other people. Certain things like antibiotics, improper nutrition as a child, ultra-processed foods, and glyphosate can alter your microbiome and lead to inflammation. The most inflammatory foods in the world are ultra-processed foods: a basic recipe of sugar, flour, and seed oils with a dash of glyphosate.

## What Is Childhood Obesity

# What is childhood obesity?

Obesity and chronic disease in childhood were uncommon, while childhood obesity, food allergies, asthma, and autism plague the children of today! The largest category of ultra-processed foods are snack foods. The problem with snacking is that you spike insulin every time you eat. Carbohydrates create the most significant spike in insulin. Not only are we snacking, but we’re snacking on the worst foods!

The pancreas is constantly working to pump out insulin to remove sugar from the blood. This eventually leads to insulin resistance, which is behind almost every chronic illness, including a fatty liver, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, inflammatory diseases, mood disorders, dementia, and more.

In 1948, we did not have not have ultra-processed food calories. Today, 65% of the teenage diet comes from ultra-processed food calories. This number is around 50% for adults and 45% for toddlers. Seed oils, such as soy, corn, cottonseed, and canola, are the worst ultra-processed food ingredients. Around 25% to 30% of all our calories come from seed oils. Grain-based starches generate 220 billion dollars per year! Highly processed industrial starches such as modified food starch, modified cornstarch, and maltodextrin spike blood sugar—often higher than consuming sugar does!

## What Ingredients Are Considered Toxic And I Shouldnt Consume Them

# What ingredients are considered toxic and I shouldn't consume them?

With just one scan, you’ll see the percentage of sugar, starch, and seed oils lurking in your food. These are the 3 deadly ingredients in ultra-processed junk foods—and my app helps you quickly identify and avoid them.

You'll be surprised at how many “healthy” foods are actually loaded with these harmful ingredients! Don’t be fooled by "zero sugar" labels. Starch is basically hidden sugar, and it’s just as harmful to your body. Most junk foods are packed with toxic ingredients like rancid seed oils, processed starches, and artificial chemicals—yet they lack the essential nutrients your body craves.

Did you know the average person consumes over 100 pounds of modified food starches every year? it’s in everything from baby formula to pet food—and it's a huge part of a teenager’s diet. It's time to take control and make smarter food choices! Junk foods are “dead” foods. They’ve been stripped of vital vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals—and loaded with preservatives, coloring, and MSG. That’s not food; that’s just a bunch of chemicals your body doesn’t know what to do with.

## What Are The Foods That You Should Avoid For Alzheimers

# What are the foods that you should avoid for Alzheimer's?

In my opinion, what you eat is the most important thing that influences dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. There is one food I believe you have to avoid if you’re trying to improve symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, and that is refined carbohydrates. Surprisingly, insulin is actually neuroprotective, and carbs increase insulin. If you’re deficient in insulin, your risk for amyloid plaquing goes up.

But this doesn’t mean you should consume more carbs. A high-carb diet is associated with high blood sugar, and people with high blood sugar or diabetes have an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. When your insulin is too high, your body starts protecting itself against excess insulin, leading to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a deficiency of insulin inside the cells. It's important to have just the right amount of insulin.

Refined carbs and sugar can also create brain inflammation. Not only that but sugar and refined carbs can destroy the energy sources for neurons and create oxidation and free-radical damage while also decreasing antioxidants.

This is why it’s key to fix insulin resistance. If you fix insulin resistance, the neurons can get the level of insulin they need for neuroprotection and to help decrease inflammation.

**How to support healthy insulin levels:**

1\. Get on the keto diet (run your body on ketones)

2\. Do intermittent fasting

3\. Do OMAD

4\. Consume nutrient-dense foods

5\. Decrease stress

## What Is The Connection Between Erythritol And Heart Health

# What is the connection between erythritol and heart health?

A new study on erythritol and heart attacks has been in the news and found its way to social media—let’s talk about it. This study correlates erythritol in your blood to higher incidents of heart attacks and strokes. However, I see some serious problems with this study.

**Here are four key points about this study:**

1\. Correlation does not mean causation.

2\. This study was based on endogenous erythritol and did not measure dietary erythritol. The body makes endogenous erythritol.

3\. The body produces erythritol when you metabolize sugar, have oxidative stress or belly fat, or consume alcohol. The great majority of people in this study were in poor health, so how do we know erythritol was the problem?

4\. Other research has liked erythritol to many different health benefits.

Could it be that erythritol is increasing in the body to counter the bad effects of sugar? It seems to me that erythritol is something that’s trying to help you and not hurt you.

## What Is The 1St Sign Of Fatty Liver

# What is the 1st sign of fatty liver?

There really is no “first sign” of a fatty liver. When you first start developing a fatty liver, there are no symptoms at all. It’s important to be aware of this because many people have a fatty liver and don’t even know it. People will start to notice signs once the condition has progressed.

Signs of a fatty liver:

• A protruding mid-section

• Insulin resistance

Fifty-nine percent of the fat in your liver originates from outside your liver—it’s fat from other places in your body that end up in the liver. Twenty-six percent of fat in the liver comes from the liver itself. The liver makes fat from glucose, and insulin is supposed to stop this process. But, because of dysfunctional fat and insulin resistance, the liver is making sugar uncontrollably. The third source of fat in the liver is dietary fat from consuming sugar. I believe the top cause of a fatty liver is a high-carb diet. The good news is that the liver is the only organ that can completely regenerate. However, there is a point of no return, so it’s time to act now.

**Natural things to do for a fatty liver:**

1\. Get on the Healthy Keto® diet and do intermittent fasting

2\. Exercise regularly

3\. Consume one to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in your water a few times a day

## What Is The Deadliest Sugar In The World

# What is the deadliest sugar in the world?

There are many different types of sugar, but the most common types of sugar are made up of glucose and fructose. Every cell in the body can metabolize glucose. But only the liver can break down fructose.

Fructose doesn’t initially trigger insulin or increase blood sugar. However, fructose can lead to a fatty liver, inflammation, scar tissue, and damage to other parts of the body. As the liver becomes fatty, you could also develop insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and high uric acid levels. Uric acid is behind gout, certain types of kidney stones, and damage to the arteries. The body actually deals with fructose the same as it would with alcohol. Even though fructose is low on the glycemic index, it’s very deadly. Many types of sugar, like table sugar, honey, beet sugar, and high fructose corn syrup, are 50 percent glucose and 50 percent fructose. But agave nectar is 85 percent fructose. This makes agave nectar the worst type of sugar you could consume.

## What Is Sugars Impact On Your Body

# What is sugar's impact on your body?

**Sugar's Impact on Your Body: Understanding the Risks and Making Healthier Choices**

Our bodies view excess sugar as a toxin, prompting a rapid removal from the bloodstream. Similar to how we maintain a steady body temperature, blood sugar levels ideally hover around 80. When we consume sugar, the hormone insulin acts as a key, unlocking our cells to allow sugar in for energy use.

However, consistently high sugar intake can lead to a dangerous chain reaction. Our cells, overwhelmed by the constant sugar influx, begin to resist insulin's attempts to deliver more. This resistance can ultimately result in type 2 diabetes, a condition where blood sugar levels remain persistently high due to insufficient insulin production or effectiveness.

Not all sugars are created equal. Highly processed sugars like white sugar, corn syrup, and agave syrup are stripped of essential nutrients like B vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. Your body needs these nutrients to effectively convert sugar into energy. When they're absent, your body has to tap into its reserves, leading to potential deficiencies over time.

In contrast, less processed sugars like raw honey, maple syrup, and date sugar retain more of their natural nutrients. Raw honey, for instance, contains over 180 beneficial compounds that aid in metabolizing the sugar itself.

If breaking free from sugar's grip feels challenging, start by swapping processed sugars for whole fruits or less refined sugar sources. Remember, the goal is to gradually reduce your overall sugar intake for optimal health.

## What Is Lactose Intolerance

# What is lactose intolerance?

Experiencing discomfort after consuming dairy? It could be lactose intolerance, a common digestive issue where your body struggles to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products.

**What is Lactose Intolerance?**

Lactose intolerance arises from insufficient lactase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down lactose. While digestive upset like bloating, gas, and diarrhea are common symptoms, lactose intolerance can also manifest as headaches, fatigue, joint pain, and even skin issues.

**Causes of Lactose Intolerance**

- **Primary:** The most common type, often genetically predisposed and developing gradually with age.

- **Secondary:** Triggered by underlying conditions like Crohn's disease, celiac disease, or medications like antibiotics.

- **Congenital:** Rare, present from birth due to genetics.

**Managing Lactose Intolerance**

- **Listen to your body:** Understand your tolerance level for dairy.

- **Lactase Supplements:** Take these over-the-counter pills before consuming dairy.

- **Alternatives:** Explore lactose-free milk substitutes like almond, soy, or oat milk. Try dairy-free cheeses and yogurts.

- **Probiotics:** Found in yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi, these beneficial bacteria can aid digestion and gut health.

**Living with Lactose Intolerance**

Thriving with lactose intolerance is achievable. It involves awareness, adaptation, and a focus on gut health. Keep a food diary to identify triggers, experiment with lactose-free options, and consider incorporating probiotics for overall digestive wellness.

**Important Note:** If you experience symptoms, consult your healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and guidance.

## Why Are My Triglycerides Elevated On The Carnivore Diet

# Why are my triglycerides elevated on the Carnivore Diet?

While Dr. Berg has created content on the benefits of the Carnivore Diet, we are not specialists in the diet.  However, Healthy Keto, which we are specialists in, and the Carnivore Diet may both enter you into a state of ketosis due to the limited intake of carbohydrates.

In ketosis, the body starts using fat as the primary source of energy. This fat may come from stored fat in the body, even if the person is thin. Triglycerides are stored in the body's fat and are mobilized when the fat is converted to energy. This can cause an increase in triglyceride levels in the blood, which may decrease over time. However, some foods allowed in the Carnivore Diet may contain additional triglycerides that could also show up in the blood.

It's important to consult a medical professional to monitor and test any increase in triglyceride levels.

## Achieving Success With Periodic Fasting

# Achieving Success with Periodic Fasting

## **Achieving Success with Periodic Fasting**

To truly harness periodic fasting's potential for improving health and managing chronic conditions, it's essential to approach it with the right strategies and mindset.

You can minimize side effects and optimize your results by focusing on consistency, gradual adaptation, and a balanced approach.

### **Transitioning Smoothly into Fasting**

One of the best ways to start intermittent fasting is to ease into it gradually. Begin by reducing your eating window by an hour or two each day until you reach your desired fasting schedule.

This allows your body to adapt more comfortably to the changes in nutrient intake and can help minimize the severity of any side effects during the adaptation period.

It's also important to focus on nutrient-dense, whole foods during your eating windows to ensure your body is getting the essential vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients it needs to function optimally.

Staying hydrated and prioritizing sleep can further support your body's adaptation to fasting and help you feel your best.

### **Optimizing Health Outcomes Through Fasting**

When done correctly, periodic fasting can offer a range of health benefits, including improved insulin sensitivity, better blood sugar control, reduced inflammation, and [enhanced cognitive function](https://www.drberg.com/blog/enhance-cognitive-function-and-mood-on-healthy-ketosis).

Maintaining a consistent fasting routine and focusing on healthy lifestyle habits can optimize these outcomes and support your overall well-being.

It's important to remember that fasting is just one piece of the health puzzle. Combining intermittent fasting with a proper diet, regular physical activity, stress management, and adequate sleep can help you achieve and maintain optimal health in the long run.

As with any new health practice, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before starting a fasting regimen, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or concerns.

With the right approach and guidance, periodic fasting can be a powerful tool for transforming your health and quality of life.

## What Is The Science Behind Low Carb Diets

# What is the science behind low-carb diets?

Low-carbohydrate diets work by reducing insulin levels and promoting fat-burning for energy production. When carb intake is minimized, blood sugar levels stabilize, and insulin sensitivity improves.

This leads to reduced hunger cravings and increased satiety after meals, which can result in weight loss over time.

## Are Brown Rice Cakes Keto

# Are brown rice cakes keto?

No, brown rice cakes aren’t keto-friendly, either. 

While brown rice offers some nutritional advantages over white rice - such as more dietary fiber - these benefits are minimal. Brown rice-based products still contain considerable amounts of carbs that can interfere with fat-burning and push you out of ketosis.

Additionally, brown rice-derived snacks like crackers or chips often include other ingredients such as sugars, flour, or syrups, increasing their net carb content.

Rice cake net carbs:

- White rice cakes: 7g per piece

- Brown rice cakes: 6g per piece

- Caramel rice cake: 11g per piece

Rice cakes aren't a good option for individuals on a keto diet due to their considerable carb content and the adverse effect on glucose levels.

Instead, exploring [keto-friendly snack alternatives](https://www.drberg.com/blog/keto-snacks-guide) that align with your dietary goals is best.

## What Is Stevia

# What is stevia?

**Understanding Stevia: A Natural Sweetener**

Stevia, derived from the leaves of the *Stevia rebaudiana* plant, is a natural sweetener known for its remarkable sweetness—up to 300 times sweeter than sugar. Used for centuries in South America, it is now a popular sugar substitute in various forms, including liquid, packets, and granulated blends.

**Impact on Blood Sugar**

Stevia has minimal impact on blood sugar levels. Unlike regular sugar, which causes rapid glucose spikes, stevia’s compounds, steviol glycosides, are not metabolized by the body. Instead, they pass through the digestive system unabsorbed, making stevia a suitable option for individuals with diabetes and those on low-carb diets.

## The Role Of Cortisol In Morning Hunger

# The Role of Cortisol in Morning Hunger

## **The Role of Cortisol in Morning Hunger**

[Cortisol, often called the "stress hormone,"](https://www.drberg.com/blog/cortisol-extremely-simplified-by-dr-berg) plays a significant role in morning hunger while fasting and doing keto. When you wake up, cortisol levels experience a significant spike.

This spike is not just a tiny increase; it's more like a high jump athlete clearing the bar. The reason this matters is that when cortisol levels rise, it also leads to an increase in glucose (sugar) levels in the body.

This rise in blood sugar is the body's way of ensuring that you have enough energy to start your day.

However, for individuals [following a ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-start-keto-correctly) or [practicing intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/my-1-best-intermittent-fasting-tips-for-faster-weight-loss-dr-berg), this increase in blood sugar can also trigger the brain to signal hunger, even if you're not hungry.

Grasping the intricate interplay of hormones is vital for those tackling unwelcome morning cravings as they commit to their nutritional objectives.

So, the next time you feel your stomach growling before breakfast while on keto or during a fasting period, remember that cortisol may be playing a role in your morning routine.

## The Sugar Industrys Influence On Dietary Guidelines

# The Sugar Industry's Influence on Dietary Guidelines

## **The Sugar Industry's Influence on Dietary Guidelines**

Did you know the sugar industry holds significant sway over our dietary guidelines? They make up only 2% of farms but account for a third of all donations from US agriculture.

It's like David throwing stones at Goliath, except this time, David has a serious sweet tooth.

### **Unveiling the Power of Lobbyists**

Sugar lobbyists have mastered the art of influence to shape dietary recommendations. Just imagine them as puppeteers controlling how we perceive and consume sugar in our diets.

Their tactics are subtle yet effective, like adding just enough sugar to your coffee without making it overly sweet.

Their power extends far beyond merely advocating for their interests. They're also skilled in altering perceptions about food pyramid recommendations—twisting scientific facts into knots that even Houdini would struggle with.

### **Discrediting Anti-Sugar Research**

Besides shaping guidelines, these clever folks are adept at undermining research suggesting harm from high-sugar consumption—it’s as if they've turned deflecting criticism into an Olympic sport.

In their world, science isn't always black or white; it's often coated with a layer of sugary deception.

As cunning as foxes sneaking through henhouses under the moonlight, they work tirelessly to discredit any evidence that paints sugar in less than glowing terms.

## **The Surprising Truth About Obesity and Metabolism**

Contrary to commonly assumed, not all obese people have a [slow metabolism](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-fix-a-slow-metabolism); research has revealed that approximately 20% maintain regular metabolic rates. Studies show that around 20% of obese individuals carry standard metabolic rates.

### **Obesity Doesn't Always Mean Poor Metabolism**

You may be astounded to find out that some people classified as overweight have normal metabolisms.

They defy the stereotype of [obesity](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-answer-to-obesity-is-obvious-if-you-look-at-the-statistics), leading inevitably to diabetes or heart disease. Just like you can't judge a book by its cover, you can't predict an individual's health based on weight alone.

Despite carrying extra pounds, they avoid the common trap of developing insulin resistance - a critical factor in metabolic syndrome and related conditions such as [type 2 diabetes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-to-eat-to-correct-diabetes) and cardiovascular diseases.

This group is often called "metabolically healthy obese" (MHO), but don't be misled – it doesn't imply obesity is good for health.

However, don't let this term fool you – it does not mean obesity is healthy. It merely means these individuals appear resilient against the usual detrimental effects of excess body fat.

[Research suggests](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22804876), though somewhat controversially due to conflicting findings from various studies, about one-fifth of those who are clinically defined as 'obese' actually fall into this MHO category.

This throws up fascinating questions for scientists looking at how we approach dieting strategies and overall health promotion.

## **The World Health Organization's Stance on Sugar Consumption**

The World Health Organization (WHO) has a clear-cut guideline regarding the daily sugar intake. According to them, your sweet tooth should be limited to 12 teaspoons of added sugar daily.

It's easy to see how quickly we can surpass the WHO recommendation of no more than 12 teaspoons of added sugar per day when one soda contains nearly that amount. And what happens if we do?

Things start getting sticky – not in the fun caramel way.

### **The Not-So-Sweet Consequences**

High consumption may lead to numerous health issues, including diabetes and heart disease. It's almost as if consuming too much sugar is akin to inviting unwanted guests into our bodies - they're hard to get rid of once they've made themselves comfortable.

In other words, while enjoying sweets now and then won't cause any harm, consistent overconsumption could turn life sour fast.

## What Is A Good Alternative To Cheese If Im Allergic To Dairy

# What is a good alternative to cheese if I’m allergic to dairy?

You could either be sensitive to the lactose, the milk, sugar which is probably not the problem. It could be the casein in there. But you may be allergic. Get a test but let's say you're not allergic and you're still reacting.

The type of the cheese matters. For example, if you get European cheese that is usually raw. You can get real raw European cheese and you probably get in America. You have to search it out.

## What Is Causing The Rise In Fatty Liver Disease In Children

# What is causing the rise in fatty liver disease in children?

The rise in fatty liver disease in children is primarily attributed to excessive consumption of sugars, including high-fructose corn syrup and maltodextrin, found in ultra-processed foods. Shockingly, 67% of children's calorie intake comes from ultra-processed foods, which are heavily processed and often referred to as junk food. This category includes sweetened cereals, even those marketed as healthy whole grain options, contributing significantly to the problem.

## Is A Plant Based Meat Diet Beneficial For Overall Health And What Are  3A8Aa1

# Is a plant-based meat diet beneficial for overall health, and what are the potential advantages and drawbacks of incorporating plant-based meat alternatives into your diet?

**Plant-based meat is marketed as clean meat. People are gravitating to these fake meats because of claims that real meat causes cancer and other chronic diseases.**

The studies that were used to draw these conclusions were food questionnaires and observational studies. Out of 800 studies on the topic, researchers claiming that meat was bad only focused on 17.

An evaluation of the studies linking red meat to cancer by the Annals of Internal Medicine concluded that the evidence linking red meat consumption to cancer and cardiovascular disease is too weak to recommend that we eat less of it.

New guidelines say we don't need to change our meat habits. No significant link between meat consumption and heart disease, diabetes, or cancer has been found.

**Plant-based meat is full of ultra-processed ingredients like seed oils, soy, modified food starches, and GMO ingredients. Claims that plant-based meat is identical to real meat are completely false. Metabolomic studies have shown key differences in 171 out of 190 compounds in fake meat compared to real meat.**

## What Does The Presence Of Belly Fat Indicate About An Individuals Heal 9Debf4

# What does the presence of belly fat indicate about an individual's health, and what factors contribute to its accumulation?

[See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/belly-fat-is-merely-a-symptom)

**For you to have a big belly, you first have to have a fatty liver.**  The liver becomes fatty due to consuming too many carbs, which turn to fat in the liver and around the organs. Eventually, the fat from the liver will spill over into other organs. All of this comes from a high-carb diet as well as frequent eating. 

In many cases, people don't associate their belly fat with any other health problems. At least, initially. They may not even see a high blood sugar problem for a few decades. This is because insulin is taking care of the blood sugar levels. But, doctors don't typically test insulin levels, so they won't see that your insulin is too high and is leading to a blood sugar problem. 

**You probably won't know you have a fatty liver.** You'll just see that you have a large belly. But, as the years go on, you can develop diabetes.  The deeper cause of insulin resistance is really a fatty liver. The liver can't function right, and everything starts backing up. But, a high-carb diet is what's really behind all of this. 

**Other symptoms of high blood sugar and high insulin:**

• Frequent urination 

• Fatigue 

• Sleep apnea 

• A weakened immune system 

• Arthritis 

• Cravings 

• Metabolic syndrome (high blood pressure, heart disease, fatty liver diabetes type 2) 

All of these things, plus the belly fat, are coming from the same things: a high carb diet, high blood glucose, and high insulin. But, the good news is that the Healthy Keto diet and intermittent fasting may help.

## What Factors Contribute To The Ongoing Need For Increased Medication A D4845B

# What factors contribute to the ongoing need for increased medication among individuals with diabetes?

What is diabetes? It’s a disease of high blood sugar, caused by eating a lot of carbohydrates. The purpose of diabetes medication is to lower blood sugar. But — this is key — it lowers only sugar in your blood, not in the rest of your body. The medication crams the sugar into other parts of your body. Usually, the sugar is converted into fat.

Your fat cells get bigger, and they spread to your liver, around your other organs, into the pancreas and your brain. Type 2 diabetes is a diet problem, which is why medication will never fix it. The medication hides the real problem and allows it to continue. Eventually, you’ll need more powerful medications for the health problems that chronic high sugar causes.

Then, you experience side effects, leading you to need more drugs for different conditions, and the chain reaction goes on and on! If this is your first time hearing this concept, and you’re a diabetic, I urge you to go on the ketogenic diet and boost your chances of getting off diabetes medication.

## Can Maltodextrin In Deodorants Be Absorbed Into The Body

# Can maltodextrin in deodorants be absorbed into the body?

Maltodextrin in deodorants is unlikely to absorb into your body and affect blood sugar levels directly. However, maltodextrin can significantly impact blood sugar responses and is commonly found in many daily products, including supplements and flavorings. It's advisable to be mindful of its presence in your diet and products you use.

## What Can Help Me To Stop Snacking Or Grazing

# What can help me to stop snacking or grazing?

With snacking, you may have a certain time that you have a snack. With grazing, there’s no limit on how much you eat, what you eat, or when you eat. You eat constantly. I believe some of the worst advice a person can give is to snack to prevent overeating.

When people start snacking and grazing, they can get into a cycle of raising their blood sugar and insulin, then dropping their blood sugar. Eating causes hunger about one and a half hours later, especially when consuming carbohydrates. Then, the process repeats. If someone is stuck in this snacking cycle, eventually, they could develop high insulin, which could then lead to insulin resistance.

**Eating and depression:** You might feel better temporarily, but then the high insulin could cause depression to worsen.

**Eating when tired:** The more you eat to try to get more energy, the more tired you’ll be.

**Eating when bored or stressed:** The more you eat when bored or stressed, the more you release cortisol, which could cause you to be more stressed.

**Eating carbs for pleasure:** You could spike dopamine, putting yourself at risk for developing dopamine resistance.

**Eating for no reason:** Some people eat because the food is there, and then they get stuck in the snacking trap.

Many people don’t realize that when they do fasting correctly, they can put the body in a condition where there is no hunger or cravings. This is because your body is essentially eating your own fat all day long. Fat generates ketones, which is a clean fuel. You’ll feel good, you could have improved cognitive function, and you could have an enhanced mood.

**What to do:**

1\. Do not eat breakfast (most important)

2\. Understand that eating causes hunger

3\. Do not make junk foods available

4\. Stay very active

5\. Avoid carbs when you eat

## Which Is More Suitable For A Ketogenic Diet Balsamic Vinegar Or Apple  B5Fb4C

# Which is more suitable for a ketogenic diet: balsamic vinegar or apple cider vinegar?

Balsamic vinegar doesn’t have fiber on it, it is pure liquid and can spike blood sugar because it is high in glycemic index. It is important to read the label because they vary – make sure you would get the one that’s only 2 grams of sugar per tablespoon.

## What Strategies Or Interventions Can Assist Someone Struggling With Ex 585E07

# What strategies or interventions can assist someone struggling with excessive carbohydrate consumption?

Carboholic is someone that is addicted to carbohydrates. This is a physical problem and a cellular level where the body is driving you to not think about the future consequences, logically it doesn’t help you to understand that.

Insulin is the hormone that allows the sugar fuel into the cell, which could lead to insulin resistance where the insulin doesn’t work anymore and that makes your body crave sugar.

Every time you consume sugar there is a spike of beta-endorphins, which is the chemicals in the body that are 30x stronger than morphine for pain and stress.

Dopamine which is a pleasure hormone that is stimulated when you take drugs is also triggered when you consume a lot of sugar and carbohydrates.

**The difference between addiction and a habit:**

• Addiction: Completely out of control and cannot say no. The more you can’t have it, the more you want it.

• Habit: Something that you can say no to. It is just like a routine you get into.

**Ways to Overcome Addiction to Carbs:**

1\. Understand what is happening in the body

2\. Heal insulin resistance

3\. Do things gradually: Start consuming keto bombs (sweet cookies that do not affect insulin)

4\. Start consuming a lot of nutrients – It is the nutrients that protect the cell against high levels of sugar

## What Is The D Mannose

# What is the D-Mannose?

D-mannose is a type of sugar that will not affect your glucose levels and doesn’t get stored as a glycogen. It is really good for a UTI (urinary tract infection). The urinary system includes the kidneys, renal pelvis, ureters, bladder and urethra. If there is an infection in the urinary tract it can create pain and an urge to urinate even when the bladder is empty.

**How to consume it**

Follow the direction on the label for the proper dosage.

D-mannose attaches to the microbe called E. coli (which is involved in 90% of UTI cases) and takes it out of the system. (If it doesn’t work, that could mean that you have different types of microbes, fungus, or bacterias in your urinary tract. In such cases, use oregano oil.)

**Where to get it**

You can get it at the health food store or order it online.

## Why Do I Have High Blood Glucose Levels On Keto

# Why do I have high blood glucose levels on Keto?

First, let’s quickly go over insulin resistance. **If a person is insulin resistant, they typically have very high insulin in their body—around 5 to 9x the normal amount.**

Insulin regulates blood sugars by lowering them and keeping them down. Over time, this mechanism weakens and your insulin levels drop. This leads to high blood sugar, prediabetes, and eventually diabetes.

**If you have high blood glucose on keto, you probably had high insulin before you started the keto diet. Once you begin a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, your body is no longer spiking insulin. Without high insulin, there is nothing keeping your blood sugars down.**

The good news is that high blood glucose on keto is temporary as your body transitions into ketosis. Your blood sugar will eventually stabilize.

## Why Is It Important To Read Labels On The Food Products

# Why is it important to read labels on the food products?

One of my staff members purchased peanut butter and asked if it was ok to eat.

It turned out that the product was cookie butter and didn’t even include any peanuts in the ingredients! Upon reading the nutrition facts, I discovered that each 2-tablespoon serving of this cookie butter contained 11 grams of sugar. With 13 servings per container, the cookie butter contained more than 100 grams of sugar!

The first ingredient was wheat flour, followed by sugar and vegetable oil. The main vegetable oil used was soy oil which is GMO and highly inflammatory. Most of the ingredients in this “peanut butter” were highly addictive and highly inflammatory. Always read food labels in their entirety to avoid consuming harmful ingredients.

## What Exercises Do You Recommend For Love Handles

# What exercises do you recommend for love handles?

Love handles result from fat accumulation in the liver that spills off in and around the organs in your mid-section.

The primary cause of love handles is a diet that’s high in sugar and refined carbs. Sugar and refined carbs cause high insulin, which causes stored fat. But, stress and a lack of sleep also cause high insulin and lead to love handle.

## What Is The Most Inflammatory Food In The World

# What is the most inflammatory food in the world?

There is a lot of debate over what the most inflammatory food is. Some people say meat, while others say it's the fiber in plants. Some people do well consuming fiber, and others don’t. Why? Humans can’t digest fiber. Your microbes are what break down fiber by fermenting it.

While fiber is anti-inflammatory, unfermented fiber is inflammatory. If you don’t have enough of the right microbes in your gut, you could have more of an issue with fiber than other people. Certain things like antibiotics, improper nutrition as a child, ultra-processed foods, and glyphosate can alter your microbiome and lead to inflammation.

The most inflammatory foods in the world are ultra-processed foods: a basic recipe of sugar, flour, and seed oils with a dash of glyphosate.

## How Does Dietary Fiber Influence Blood Sugar Levels And What Mechanism E1D2A5

# How does dietary fiber influence blood sugar levels, and what mechanisms underlie its role in regulating glucose metabolism?

Fiber plays a crucial role in moderating blood sugar levels by affecting the glycemic load of foods. Foods high in fiber, like carrots, have a low glycemic load because fiber slows the absorption of carbohydrates, preventing rapid spikes in blood sugar. For example, despite carrots having a relatively high glycemic index of 72, their glycemic load is very low at 3 due to their fiber content. In contrast, foods with low fiber, such as potatoes, can have a high glycemic load, with a boiled potato scoring 31. Therefore, incorporating high-fiber foods can help stabilize blood sugar levels by reducing the glycemic load, just be sure to check the glycemic index before consumption.

## Can Fluctuations In Blood Sugar Levels Contribute To The Occurrence Of 7C94D0

# Can fluctuations in blood sugar levels contribute to the occurrence of headaches and migraines?

Low blood sugar can trigger headaches and migraines. When you eat carbs, your blood sugar goes up, and your ache may disappear. However this will not resolve the issue because shortly after, your blood sugar will go low again, causing a new headache.

I recommend getting on the Healthy Keto® diet, which will give your body a better type of fuel for your brain: ketones (a byproduct of fat-burning). Ketones will not cause your blood sugar to go up and down. Stable blood sugar may resolve the headache issue.

(Note: If you have just started a keto diet, headaches could be a symptom of adapting to the diet.)

## Should I Quit Consuming Sugar

# Should I quit consuming sugar?

Sugar consumption is linked to a host of negative health effects, including diabetes, asthma, depression, stroke, heart attack, gout, hypertension, dementia, cancer, and early death. Even individuals with a healthy weight can suffer from metabolic syndrome due to high sugar intake. Sugar, especially fructose, is deemed as toxic as alcohol, supporting harmful industries and harming the body. Transitioning to keto-friendly desserts and sugar-free chocolate can help reduce sugar intake and promote better health.

## Why Isnt The Ketogenic Diet Working For My Hypoglycemia

# Why isn't the ketogenic diet working for my hypoglycemia?

Someone was having an issue with keto where they said that keto didn’t work because even though they did keto and felt better after doing it for a month, they went back on their diet, and their hypoglycemia came back.

What causes hypoglycemia (low blood sugars) is something you ate that’s triggering insulin, and the insulin is pushing your blood sugars down. When you have hypoglycemia, you may think you need to consume sugar because your sugar is low. But, the problem with this is that you’re just going to activate insulin again, which will bring the blood sugar back down. I don’t believe you can correct hypoglycemia by consuming more carbs.

When someone starts the keto diet, they also really need to commit to it for longer than one month. If a person has hypoglycemia, they have very severe insulin resistance. It could take several years before this person could get into a stabilized position, and if the person was to go back to carbs, the situation would just come back. The keto and intermittent fasting plan is designed to be a lifestyle change.

## What Is Hypoglycemia Without Symptoms

# What is hypoglycemia without symptoms?

When adopting a ketogenic diet or fasting, lower blood sugar levels, even below typical thresholds, can occur without symptoms in individuals adapted to using ketones and fats for energy. Symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as confusion, irritability, and shaking, indicate true hypoglycemia despite low readings, warranting attention. Idiopathic hypoglycemia, related to insulin receptor issues, or reactive hypoglycemia post-carb meals are also considerations. Transitioning to a low-carb ketogenic diet and integrating fasting gradually can effectively manage these conditions.

## What Is The Most Prevalent Cause Of Hypoglycemia And How Does This Con 1E24B4

# What is the most prevalent cause of hypoglycemia, and how does this condition typically manifest in individuals?

If you’re diabetic, blood sugar levels below 70mg/dl are considered hypoglycemia. If you’re not a diabetic, blood sugar levels below 50mg/dl are considered hypoglycemia.

**There are many types of hypoglycemia.**

• Idiopathic hypoglycemic: unknown cause

• Idiopathic postprandial hypoglycemic: symptoms of hypoglycemia without low blood sugars

• Adrenal-related hypoglycemia: hypoglycemia due to abnormal adrenal function

• Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia: related to high insulin

Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is the most common form of hypoglycemia.

**However, the most common cause of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is really excessive carbohydrate consumption, which causes inulin resistance.**

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## What Is The Most Potent Treatment For Eradicating Candida Infections

# What is the most potent treatment for eradicating candida infections?

Now, we normally have candida living in our bodies without any issue. But when you take an antibiotic, your defenses are lowered and you end up with an overgrowth of candida. This is a fungal infection caused by yeast, the most common being candida Albicans.

If this infection turns your tongue white, that’s a condition called thrush. Sometimes the white patches are on the inside of your cheek; sometimes there are small red patches on your tongue. If the infection is in your vagina, it’s called a yeast infection. If in your esophagus, it’s called candida esophagitis.

Garlic is, hands down, the most powerful fungus killer. It also works on toenail fungus. Garlic has a natural phytochemical called ajoene that’s responsible for its power to kill fungus. Ajoene is also a natural blood thinner; drug companies are researching it to use in medication for blood clotting disorders.

Crush up fresh garlic and put it in your food on a regular basis. But you also have to fix your diet! Lower your sugar intake. Reduce your consumption of milk sugar. I recommend a healthy keto plan with intermittent fasting. If you’re consuming garlic but your sugar and carb consumption is still high, I doubt your fungal infection will go away. You want to starve off the fungus and re-establish the friendly flora in your body.

I also recommend a type of probiotic called effective microbes, to help your gut flora. Garlic has many other phytochemicals that provide you with health benefits. Not only is it anti-fungal, but antibacterial and antiviral as well. Garlic has been shown to be very effective for basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer.

Now you can see how effective garlic is to kill candida.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Frequent Vomiting

# What are the potential causes of frequent vomiting?

Nausea is discomfort and uneasiness that makes you want to throw up or vomit. Usually it’s a one-time event linked to something that doesn’t settle right in the stomach. Most of the time, vomiting is harmless, but if it’s recurring, it can be a sign of a more serious illness.

**Cause #1: Gallbladder problems / bile duct**

The gallbladder is a very important organ for your body as it stores bile. Bile is very important for our digestion and breakdown of fats. If you take something that your digestive system is not used to, this can overload your gallbladder ducts and cause confusion in your stomach. As a result you can feel nauseous.

**Remedies:**

- Take ginger (in a tea or supplement)

- Take peppermint (in a tea or supplement)

- Take cayenne pepper (in a supplement)

- Take chamomile tea

- Take meadowsweet tea

To avoid feeling nauseous in the future, do the following:

- Ask yourself: when did the nausea start?

- Ask yourself: what did you eat before that?

- Avoid that food if it’s unhealthy

- If it’s a healthy food, decrease it

**Other causes:**

- Motion sickness

- Food poisoning

- Chemotherapy

- Low blood sugar

- Medications/drugs

- Kidney stones

- Pregnancy

## Is Losing 5 Pounds Per Month Normal

# Is losing 5 pounds per month normal?

It depends. Some people would say that it’s not normal and that you should be losing a lot more.

When you evaluate anything, you’re comparing what’s normal and what’s going on with you. So, it’s very important for you to know what is normal and what’s not. Someone with a healthy fast metabolism could lose about two pounds of fat per week. If a person is fasting for a week, they might lose about 3.5 pounds.

But, you might have a slow metabolism, which means you might only lose one pound per week. Normal weight loss for someone with a slow metabolism is half a pound to one pound of fat per week. So, four pounds of fat loss per month isn’t bad for someone with a slow metabolism.

It’s important to keep in mind that it only takes a tiny amount of carbohydrates to block fat burning for two to three days. There are different factors like this to look at, so you can know what normal actually is and so you don’t get frustrated and give up when it’s actually working.

## What Is A Keto Fat Bomb

# What is a keto fat bomb?

A keto fat bomb is a keto dessert that is loaded with healthy fats. It is a great way to stay satisfied between meals if you’re doing the keto diet and intermittent fasting.

Just remember to only have one with your meal, as a keto dessert, and not as a snack between meals.

There is no sugar in these tasty keto-friendly treats – only healthy fats to help get your body move into fat-burning and stay in fat-burning.

**Chocolate Keto Fat Bombs Ingredients:**

1⁄2 cup coconut oil

1⁄2 cup peanut butter

2 Tbsp cocoa powder

3 Tbsp xylitol or other sweetener

1⁄4 tsp vanilla

**Instructions:**

Mix it all up, pour into a tray and put into freezer.

## Can I Eat Cornstarch On Keto

# Can I eat cornstarch on keto?

You can’t. Starch is a bunch of glucose molecules stuck together. It’s basically concentrated sugar. It breaks down a little slower than pure sugar, but it will still raise insulin.

---

## Can I Eat Cucumbers On Keto

# Can I eat cucumbers on keto?

**Yes. 5 basic benefits of cucumbers:**

• May help stabilize blood sugars

• May help stabilize cholesterol

• Have anti-inflammatory properties

• Are loaded with powerful antioxidants

• Provide fiber to make butyrate (butyrate can help with insulin resistance)

## Does Keto Diet Make You Gassy

# Does Keto diet make you gassy?

Keto itself should not cause gas, but you may have preexisting gastrointestinal problems that do cause it.

Colon cells have “roots” that absorb the nutrients passing through the intestines. If you have pre-existing problems with your colon cells, they wouldn’t absorb nutrients and that would prevent the combination of certain enzymes with food particles to break down the food for absorption into the cells. You could end up having undigested food particles in the intestines. The undigested food then would either rot or ferment, causing gases.

Sources of this problem:

- Antibiotics – destroy some of your body’s microbes and cause the body to make more of the unfriendly microbes

- Antacids – when you lose the acidity of the stomach and as you age, you lose the stomach acids

- Junk food

- Small intestines (overgrowth of bacteria entering small intestines can cause gases)

Recommendation:

- Adjust the type of fiber that you consume

- Adjust the quantity of fiber – start with small amounts and gradually increase over time.

## Are Granola Bars Keto Friendly And Safe To Consume

# Are granola bars keto-friendly and safe to consume?

No.

When you see a box of granola bars, you may note that the packaging says it’s 100% natural and organic, and it contains no artificial flavoring or coloring. That means that it must be healthy – right?

If you read the back label of the granola bars, the “healthy” granola bar may not seem so healthy. Here’s what is in a typical granola bar:

- Whole oats

- Sugar

- Canola oil

- Yellow corn flour

- Soy flour

- Brown sugar syrup

- Baking soda

- Natural flavoring

Keep in mind that the first few ingredients on a particular label typically make up the majority of the product.

These ingredients make up 29 grams of carbohydrates per serving. They are very high on the glycemic index, which means they have the potential to contribute to blood sugar issues and weight gain.

In summary, granola bars are not keto-friendly at all. They contain a massive amount of sugar that will knock you out of ketosis very quickly. Avoid these products at all costs.

## What Vegetables Are The Most Keto Friendly

# What vegetables are the most keto-friendly?

Healthy vegetables that have less than 1 carb per cup:

- Beet greens

- Arugula

- Lettuce

- Bok choy

- Chard

- Endive

- Mustard greens

- Spinach

- Sprouts

- Romaine

- White cress

You’re allowed 20 to 50 grams of carbs per day on the Healthy Keto® eating plan. Sometimes when people do keto, they’re afraid to eat too many vegetables because of the carbs. But if you consume these low-carb veggies, the carbs would basically be insignificant. These vegetables won’t stop you from losing weight, and they provide benefits like fiber and nutrients.

Healthy vegetables that have less than 3 carbs per cup:

- Avocado

- Asparagus

- Celery

- Chili pepper

- Cucumber

- Eggplant

- Mushroom

- Pickles

- Radish

- Zucchini

- Cabbage

Tomatoes in moderate amounts are OK.

High-carb vegetables (not recommended):

- Artichoke

- Pumpkin

- Rutabaga 

- Turnip

- Potato

- Corn

- Squash

- Peas

## I Just Started Keto. Can I Have A Cheat Meal

# I just started keto. Can I have a cheat meal?

It is certainly not recommended.

When you first start keto and you’re not fully adapted to fat burning, just one cheat meal can mean it takes you a lot longer (24+ hours) to get back on track.

Look for alternative types of pleasure foods that mimic the brownies, cakes, cookies, bread, pizza etc. that you crave. Go for keto-friendly, low-carb, no-sugar treats to satisfy that craving.

Once you start cheating it is hard to stop because sugar is addictive. Having cheat meals will put your blood sugar levels on a roller coaster. Having unstable blood sugars will not help you correct insulin problems that are a barrier to weight loss.

Once you are fully keto-adapted and have enough health reserve, if you decide to have a cheat meal you can bounce back a lot quicker to make up for the damage. Your goal is to create health with consistency. Start where you are and build yourself up to being 100%.

## Is Keto Not For Me If I Feel Better On Carbs

# Is keto not for me if I feel better on carbs?

To answer that question, first let’s cover why you feel better on carbs.

Usually in this situation you are dealing with low blood sugars (hypoglycemia). With this condition you will find that you can’t go from one meal to the next without feeling irritable or you can’t handle going a certain amount of time without eating some carbs.

When you consume sugar or refined carbs this will raise your blood sugar and you will feel better. However, shortly after you will feel cravings and hunger again. This is because your body will produce insulin to lower the blood sugars.

So if you feel better on carbs it simply means you have insulin and blood sugar problems and a ketogenic diet is definitely for you. Once you get through the transition period (to fat burning), you will feel uplifted, with more energy and better cognitive function.

## How Do We Calculate Net Carbs

# How do we calculate net carbs?

## What Is Insulin

# What is insulin?

Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that lowers blood sugar and allows cells to absorb nutrients. Insulin is like a key that unlocks cells and opens the door to allow glucose and nutrition to go into the cells. Insulin stores sugar in the liver and muscle, in the form of glycogen that is released for quick energy. It is also a fat-making hormone that will convert extra sugar into body fat.

The problem with insulin roots in too much insulin due to too much dietary sugar, as insulin in itself is not bad for your body. High amounts of sugar will trigger high amounts of insulin, and as a result your cells eventually are going to resist excess insulin; initially your pancreas will produce more insulin to counter this resistance. Over time, the pancreas becomes exhausted and produces less insulin leaving the blood sugars uncontrolled. This condition is called insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is behind many body problems, including type 2 diabetes but also metabolic syndrome.

## Why Is Dr. Bergs Chewable Vitamin C Superior To Any Other Vitamin C Pr 498761

# Why is Dr. Berg's Chewable Vitamin C superior to any other Vitamin C products on the market?

Think about most vitamin C supplements – they're essentially just ascorbic acid. Now, calling isolated ascorbic acid "Vitamin C" is debatable because, in nature, Vitamin C is always part of a complex. This natural complex contains ascorbic acid (the antioxidant part) along with bioflavonoids, Vitamin J, trace minerals, and other natural cofactors.

Our approach is to provide Vitamin C from a food base. Instead of the synthetic ascorbic acid often made chemically from cornstarch and sulfuric acid (yes, really, and often from China), we concentrate actual berries rich in natural Vitamin C. This way, you're getting Vitamin C in the form your body is designed by nature to receive it.

Why is cheap, synthetic ascorbic acid so common? It comes down to economics. It's incredibly cheap to manufacture, leading to immense profit margins – potentially 7000% or more. Producing natural, food-based Vitamin C is much more costly, which means significantly less profit, explaining its relative rarity in the market.

## How Can I Improve My Sleep When On Intermittent Fasting Plan

# How can I improve my sleep when on Intermittent fasting plan?

**Sleep is vitally important when you’re on keto and intermittent fasting. Let’s find out how to improve sleep if you’re having challenges.**

A lack of high-quality sleep could be the reason you’re not losing weight. Most of the hard-core fat-burning through the stimulation of growth hormone happens when you’re asleep. Also, fixing insulin resistance and blood sugar problems requires sleep. If you have diabetes, you probably notice that your blood sugars are way off on the days when you didn’t get a good night’s sleep.

Insomnia is a symptom of another problem; insomnia isn’t a disease. Let’s go through some reasons why you may not be getting high-quality sleep.

**The first is frequent eating.** If you’re not doing intermittent fasting, and you eat snacks between meals, that will spike your insulin. You’ll be tired during the day but not be able to sleep at night. So, plus in intermittent fasting. Three meals per day, no snacks, then gradually move to two meals per day, no snacks.

**Second, you may be getting up frequently to urinate.** That’s a problem with insulin resistance. One of the symptoms of diabetes is frequent urination. Doing keto and intermittent fasting correctly will eventually correct the frequent urination. If you want to do a test to determine if you have a problem with insulin resistance, get a test called HOMA-IR.

Or you may have problems with your adrenals caused by accumulated stress in your body. Your body is in a constant state of flight or fight. I suggest a natural sleep aid and massage. If you’re consuming foods that cause you to bloat, such as cruciferous vegetables, that could disrupt your sleep. Start eating regular green lettuce instead, for example. Reduce the amount of cruciferous vegetables you consume, then gradually increase it.

**Lastly, sleep apnea could be the culprit.** It’s a problem of too much insulin. Keto and intermittent fasting will eventually correct it and help improve your sleep.

## What Is Bulletproof Coffee And Is It Recommended For A Ketogenic Diet

# What is bulletproof coffee, and is it recommended for a ketogenic diet?

Bulletproof coffee is coffee with grass-fed butter, MCT oil / coconut oil, and cream blended into it. It’s consumed in the morning as a meal replacement. It’s a good thing, and can be a great first step to start out with because the fat in the coffee will allow you to go a longer period of time before feeling hungry again.

You should know that bulletproof coffee will trigger insulin a little bit. For most this will not raise blood sugars, but will raise ketones. The added fat can cause your weight loss to slow because your body will convert this fat into ketones and burn it as fuel instead of using your own fat reserve. Once you have become fat-adapted you may want to remove the butter and MCT oil from your coffee.

One bulletproof coffee hack is coffee, MCT oil, xylitol and 100% cacao powder. Xylitol is 30 on the glycemic index, not zero, so it does influence the blood sugars a little bit, but not in a significant way. The 100% cacao enhances cognitive function, it has cardiovascular protection, it helps your blood sugars, it’s anti-inflammatory and it can improve your mood.

## What Do I Do If Im Experiencing False Hunger Cravings On Intermittent Fasting

# What do I do if I'm experiencing false hunger cravings on Intermittent Fasting?

Hunger during fasts is due to higher levels of cortisol, the adrenal hormone. Cortisol naturally spikes at 8 a.m. due to the circadian rhythm. This isn't caused by a lack of food but by a temporary hormonal shift that raises and then lowers blood sugar levels. The hunger pangs typically subside within 30-60 minutes. The longer you fast, the better your body will adjust, and the hunger pangs should subside.

## Whats The Difference Between Ketogenic Diet And Intermittent Fasting

# What's the difference between ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting?

The ketogenic diet (keto) and intermittent fasting are two different dietary approaches with different focuses. Keto is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that aims to induce ketosis, where the body burns fat for fuel, by strictly reducing sugar and carb intake. In contrast, intermittent fasting centers on the timing of meals, alternating between periods of eating and fasting, without specifying what foods to eat.

While keto requires significant changes to food choices to maintain specific macronutrient ratios, intermittent fasting offers flexibility and can be combined with various diets, including keto. Combining keto and intermittent fasting can have many health benefits, including weight loss and autophagy (cellular renewal).

## How Can I Avoid Getting Angry While I Do Intermittent Fasting

# How can I avoid getting angry while I do intermittent fasting?

When you start intermittent fasting, your body is initially running on sugar stores. After a long enough period, your body will have used up all the glycogen and will switch over to burning fat for energy. If you eat a meal high in sugars after a period of intermittent fasting, this will cause a drastic spike in insulin, leading to irritability. To avoid this, be sure that your meals are rich in nutrients and low in carbohydrates, so that your blood sugar remains in a healthy range and you do not experience mood swings.

## Why Is Having A Weight Loss Goal A Bad Idea

# Why is having a weight loss goal a bad idea?

**Your weight loss goal is setting you up for failure. I’ll explain by giving you several concepts, so you may want to take notes.** 

First, the difference between muscle and fat. One pound of fat takes up more space than one pound of muscle. Overweight people have less muscle than fat. A keto and intermittent fasting program will solve your stubborn weight and metabolism issue. When you start the program, you’ll lose fat and increase muscle because you’ll trigger certain muscle-building hormones as you train your body to use fat for fuel. You’ll also lose water weight. When you use up the stored sugar in your body, you’ll release the significant amount of water that’s attached to the glycogen. 

Most people who go on any weight loss program lose water weight for the first one to two weeks. But that weight loss isn’t consistent. Plus, when you start Keto and intermittent fasting you may or may not lose overall weight while you gain muscle. If you only focus on losing fat and not gaining muscle, you end up thinner but flabby and weak. You also may or may not lose inches. Most of the time you will, but you may plateau because you’re gaining muscle. Losing weight isn’t linear. It isn’t consistent when you’re gaining muscle along with losing fat. But this is what you want to develop a strong, healthy body. You don’t want your muscles to atrophy, although many people’s muscles do, especially women going through menopause. 

Plus, the more muscle you have, the better your metabolism. Muscle burns more calories. You want to make sure the calories being burned are from fat, not sugar. Lower your carb intake, and your body will burn fat. Hormonally, the difference between men and women comes down to two different hormones. Men have more testosterone. Women have more estrogen, which creates the fat layer around the female body. This is why men lose weight faster. They’re not dealing with the amount of estrogen that causes their body to create a fat layer. You see why I recommend not making weight loss your main goal. You’ll most likely just get frustrated and discouraged. Instead, have several goals: inches lost, weight loss, health improvement, and a strength goal. Weight loss isn’t the only measure of your success.

## Can I Eat Quinoa On Keto

# Can I eat quinoa on Keto?

Quinoa is a seed from a tall leafy plant that grows up to 3 to 9ft. It is very low on the glycemic index but it can still spike your blood sugars. It is gluten-free but it is processed in many factories that also process wheat - so it could be exposed to glute. And it has a similar compound to gluten that could also create a similar inflammatory reaction in the gut.

## Why My Hypoglycemia Is Back And Im On Keto

# Why my hypoglycemia is back and I'm on Keto?

Someone was having an issue with keto where they said that keto didn’t work because even though they did keto and felt better after doing it for a month, they went back on their diet, and their hypoglycemia came back.

What causes hypoglycemia (low blood sugars) is something you ate that’s triggering insulin, and the insulin is pushing your blood sugars down. When you have hypoglycemia, you may think you need to consume sugar because your sugar is low. But, the problem with this is that you’re just going to activate insulin again, which will bring the blood sugar back down. I don’t believe you can correct hypoglycemia by consuming more carbs.

When someone starts the keto diet, they also really need to commit to it for longer than one month. If a person has hypoglycemia, they have very severe insulin resistance. It could take several years before this person could get into a stabilized position, and if the person was to go back to carbs, the situation would just come back. The keto and intermittent fasting plan is designed to be a lifestyle change.

## Is Intermittent Fasting Good For Someone Who Is A Diabetic

# Is intermittent fasting good for someone who is a diabetic?

Diabetes is a condition of high sugar (hyperglycemia). The purpose of the medication that diabetic takes is to lower blood sugars – sometimes the medication could drive the blood sugar too low that could cause hypoglycemia.

When you do intermittent fasting, you decrease the need for insulin and the medication for a diabetic. The insulin that the diabetic is taking is not the same as the body produces.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before you start taking any new supplements, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Does The Chewable Vitamin C Contain Gum Arabic

# Does the Chewable Vitamin C Contain Gum Arabic?

Gum arabic is used in supplements for several reasons, primarily as an inactive ingredient (also known as an excipient) to improve the formulation and stability of the product:

Binding Agent: In tablets, it helps to bind the active ingredients together, ensuring the tablet holds its shape.

Thickener and Texturizer: It can be used to give a desirable consistency or texture to liquid, chewable, or powdered supplements.

Film Former/Coating Agent: It can be used to coat tablets or encapsulate sensitive ingredients, protecting them from moisture or oxidation and sometimes masking taste.

Source of Soluble Fiber: While typically used in small amounts for its functional properties, gum arabic is also a source of soluble dietary fiber, which can be an added benefit.

Safety Profile: It has a long history of safe use in food and pharmaceuticals and is generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

In summary, gum arabic is used in supplements as a versatile, natural excipient that helps with the manufacturing process, improves the stability and texture of the final product, ensures consistent dosing, and is well-tolerated.

## How To Do Teeth Whitening At Home

# How to do teeth whitening at home?

You don’t need to go to the dentist or purchase whitening strips for white teeth. Baking soda is nonabrasive and can be used to gently scrub your teeth to remove stains and plaque. You can combine baking soda with 3% hydrogen peroxide to whiten teeth at home. Combine 1 teaspoon of baking soda with 3 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide and 8 drops of water. This mixture breaks the bonds of tooth stains, leaving you with whiter teeth. It’s also beneficial for eliminating bacteria and reducing plaque formation.

Use a toothbrush to gently polish your teeth with this paste for 1 to 2 minutes. Rinse your mouth thoroughly when you’re finished. Do this 2 to 3 times per week for a few weeks for whiter teeth. Teeth whitening should be done gradually to avoid damaging the gums and tooth enamel. Oil pulling is an ancient practice that involves swishing oil in the mouth for 10 to 20 minutes. Coconut oil is great for oil pulling. It’s high in lauric acid, a potent anti-microbial that is effective against bacteria, fungus, and candida. It also helps with bad breath. Research has found oil pulling to be as effective as prescription mouthwash against gingivitis. Vitamin C and glucose compete in the body. Bleeding gums are often caused by low vitamin C. If you consume a lot of sugar, glucose will block your vitamin C, which will show up in your gums.

Vitamin C and glucose compete in the body. Bleeding gums are often caused by low vitamin C. If you consume a lot of sugar, glucose will block your vitamin C, which will show up in your gums.

## Do Zero Sugar Foods Really Have No Sugar

# Do zero sugar foods really have no sugar?

Despite recent denials by doctors and organizations like the Sugar Association, there is growing evidence that excessive sugar consumption poses serious health risks, particularly for the cardiovascular system. This mirrors the tactics used by tobacco companies in the past to downplay the dangers of cigarettes.

The average person consumes 23 teaspoons of sugar daily, but this number doesn't account for hidden sugars lurking in many processed foods. Even products claiming to be sugar-free often contain starches, which can spike blood sugar even higher than sugar itself.

Highly processed starches like maltodextrin and modified food starch are not the same as natural starches found in potatoes or rice. They can wreak havoc on blood sugar levels and overall health. When these hidden starches are factored in, the average daily sugar consumption skyrockets to 75 teaspoons!

High-sugar diets deplete nutrient stores and cause oxidative damage, leading to chronic conditions like diabetes, Alzheimer's, inflammation, and skin problems. While processed foods are often fortified with synthetic vitamins, they are no substitute for whole, nutrient-dense foods.

Eliminating sugar and starch from your diet can break this cycle of disease, reverse fatty liver, lower blood sugar, and even promote ketosis, a state where your body burns fat for fuel instead of glucose. Ketones are a superior energy source for the heart compared to glucose.

## Does My Diet Impact My Dental Health

# Does my diet impact my dental health?

## **Diet's Impact on Dental Problems**

Although clove oil can be effective for toothaches, it is not a comprehensive solution, and dietary changes may be necessary to address the root cause. Most dental issues stem from diet, especially sugar intake. So, if you always reach for clove oil, it's time to examine your plate.

### **Sugar's Effect on Teeth**

Sugar and dental problems go hand in hand. Bacteria in your mouth feed on sugar, producing acid that attacks the tooth enamel, leading to cavities.

- **Tooth decay:** High sugar intake leads to cavities.

- [**Gum disease**](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-causes-bleeding-gums)**:** Excess sugar causes plaque buildup, leading to gingivitis.

- **Tooth loss:** Advanced gum disease can damage bones supporting teeth, leading to tooth loss.

Excess sugar consumption can impair the body's natural defenses, increasing the risk of developing abscesses and periodontal diseases.

### **Long-Term Solutions through Diet Changes**

For long-term dental solutions, a change in diet is the best option. Reducing sugar intake is critical because less sugar means less harmful bacterial activity in our mouths.

- **Avoid processed foods:** Whole foods offer essential vitamins and minerals for healthy teeth and gums.

- **Limited snacking:** Frequent snacking provides a constant fuel source for harmful bacteria. Stick to 2-3 balanced meals per day.

- **Increase water intake:** Drinking water rinses away food particles and aids saliva production, neutralizing destructive acids.

## Do I Have To Eat More If Im Not Losing Weight

# Do I have to eat more if I'm not losing weight?

The reason that you're not losing weight is that you're not eating enough. So the solution is to just eat more food, right?

This just doesn't make any sense. How could adding more food cause you to lose calories?

**What you do want to do to support healthy weight loss is to increase your nutrients. Vitamins, minerals, and other vital nutrients can help support a healthy body and promote weight loss.**

**The best way to lose weight is to cut out your carbohydrates and eat less frequently.** This doesn't mean you need to lower your calories—just avoid any calories from carbohydrates and eat less often. What this does is decreases insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the cause of a slow metabolism.

**If you can't seem to lose weight, this is a sign of insulin resistance.** Chances are, you are eating way too many carbohydrates. Keep in mind that lowering your calories is not a good idea either. Lowering your calories can deplete the body of nutrients and low down your metabolism further. Avoid low-calorie diets! In summary, Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting are the best ways to lose weight and support a healthy body.

## What Are The Main Causes Of Joint Pain And How Do These Factors Affect Fefa45

# What are the main causes of joint pain, and how do these factors affect overall joint health and mobility?

Here are some things Vitamin C is responsible for:

• It's involved with collagen synthesis

• It can help lower inflammation 

• The need for vitamin C increases with stress (such as infection or surgery)

• Vitamin C is an antioxidant and a cofactor for opioids 

• Vitamin C is required for collagen  

• Vitamin C can't be absorbed in the presence of sugar 

If you're consuming sugar, or you're prediabetic or diabetic, that elevated sugar situation could prevent vitamin C from being absorbed. Vitamin C and glucose have a similar chemistry. In the presence of vitamin C and glucose, your body will always absorb glucose before the vitamin C. Insulin resistance could also cause a person to be deficient in vitamin C.  This could easily show up as joint pain.

## What Lifestyle Changes Can Promote Longevity Improve Health And Reduce Eefbbf

# What lifestyle changes can promote longevity, improve health, and reduce age-related diseases?

If we look at risk factors for heart disease, high LDL increases your risk by 38 percent. But insulin resistance increases your risk by 540 percent.

Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, like diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension, can be caused by insulin resistance. This seems to mean that insulin resistance is the biggest risk factor for premature cardiac death.

The most popular mainstream treatment for high cholesterol is statin drugs. Studies have shown that statins can potentially lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. Healthy mitochondria are essential to longevity. Statins may also impair the mitochondria and increase apoptosis (death of the mitochondria).

An interesting study links higher LDL cholesterol to inversely affecting mortality. This means that having higher LDL may help extend your lifespan. Cholesterol is involved in a myriad of functions in the body—it’s essential for a healthy life.

Blood thinners and even the heart-healthy diet recommended by the American Heart Association can also contribute to insulin resistance and high blood sugar. To live longer, improving insulin resistance, making insulin more sensitive, and stabilizing your blood sugar is crucial.

**The most important things you can do to support healthy insulin and blood sugar include:**

1\. Getting on a low-carb diet (the ketogenic diet)

2\. Doing intermittent fasting

3\. Not restricting cholesterol

4\. Consuming vegetables

5\. Exercising

## Does Fiber Make Me Fat

# Does fiber make me fat?

Fiber is a carbohydrate, however, it doesn’t have a direct effect on blood sugars and you can’t even digest it.

The benefit of vegetable fiber is turning the microbes into a healthy fat called butyrate. Butyrate reduces insulin resistance which can help you lose weight.

Low amounts of microbes cause you to gain weight and the combination of low microbes in the gut and fiber could cause bloating, gas, and other issues. He also talks about several causes of low microbes and the condition called SIBO or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

**Vegetable Fibers Benefits:**

• Vitamins

• Minerals

• Trace minerals

• Butyrate

• B Vitamins

• Buffer pH

• Phytonutrients

**Functions of Bile:**

• Helps prevent fatty liver

• Helps with lowering blood sugars and improving insulin resistance

## What Are The Most Effective Remedies Or Treatment Approaches For Manag 08F2Ac

# What are the most effective remedies or treatment approaches for managing cataracts, and how do these methods work to slow their progression or improve vision?

Typical treatments for cataracts have side effects, so today we’re going to talk about natural alternatives for cataracts.

The eyes are highly affected by your blood sugar levels. When your blood sugar is high, it creates a lot of oxidative stress in different tissues, including the eyes.

Our bodies produce antioxidants to protect against this oxidation and free radical damage. But certain things, like age and diet, can cause our bodies to make fewer antioxidants. However, plants also make potent antioxidants that we can take advantage of to help counter the effects of oxidative stress. The two categories that we’re focusing on today are carotenoids and anthocyanins.

**Foods high in carotenoids:**

• Yellow, orange, red, and purple vegetables

• Pasture-raised egg yolks

• Grass-fed meats

**Foods high in anthocyanins:**

• Bilberries

• Blueberries

• Blackberries

• Chokeberries

• Black currant

• Red cabbage

**Here is the best natural remedy to potentially help with cataracts.**

**Ingredients:**

• 1 cup berries

• 1 cup kefir (grass-fed, whole milk, unsweetened)

## Can I Take The Probiotic With Prebiotic Blend With The Advanced Digest 0E5670

# Can I take the Probiotic with Prebiotic Blend with the Advanced Digestive Enzymes?

Yes, you can take the Probiotic with the Prebiotic Blend along with digestive enzymes. Combining a digestive enzyme supplement with probiotics can significantly enhance their health benefits. Digestive enzymes help break down food into smaller particles, releasing prebiotic fibers that probiotic microbes can ferment to generate energy and nutrients. This synergy supports overall digestive health and nutrient absorption.

While the two supplements can be taken together, it is best to take them at different times of the day. Advanced Digestive Enzymes are best taken a few minutes before a meal to help raise the acidity in the stomach. However, Probiotic with Prebiotic Blend is best in the morning, during a meal, or after meals when stomach acidity is lower. This timing helps ensure that the probiotics survive the acidic conditions of the stomach and reach the intestines, where they can be most effective.

## How Can A Pro Athlete Transition To Keto And Fasting Safely Without Ha Ce1D0D

# How can a pro athlete transition to keto and fasting safely without having the risk of kidney stones?

There's a couple of factors that make up the stone. One is the consumption of food that has a lot of oxalates in it. You want to avoid those foods. It's very high in almonds and almond flour. A lot of Keto products contain almonds or almond flour. Spinach also has high levels of oxalates. As well as chocolate and even sugar-free chocolate. Kiwis are also on the list. Try avoiding these foods.

But the other thing too, is that it's impossible to get a kidney stone unless there's a super concentrated urine in your bladder or your kidneys. One solution is to make sure you have at least two and a half liters of fluid a day.

## As Someone With Elevated Cholesterol Is Keto Even Possible While I Eat 31Fee6

# As someone with elevated cholesterol, is keto even possible while I eat only fish?

Absolutely because here's some data that you may not know. Cholesterol many times especially the kind that can invade your arteries is converted from carbs. So if you're doing the fatty fish hence you're going to be fine. Then do the rest vegetables, not the grains, not the sugar because the fatty liver can be coming from nonfat sources. It could be coming from vegan carbohydrates. And so they found that if you do a low carb diet the fat on your liver potentially can reduce to 50% in two weeks.

I would combine the healthy keto with the fish and do an intermittent fasting together. That'll be your best bet. I'd probably add into the mix the milk thistle because that's one of the best remedies for supporting liver and improving liver enzymes. The cruciferous vegetables are great for the liver.

**\*Please keep in mind that the above is not a medical advice. You should see your doctor about any possible medical conditions.**

It’s not recommended. A lot of people think that alcohol is keto-friendly. They say “I drink hard liquor like whiskey, vodka, brandy, tequila, a dry martini – alcohol has no carbs, it has antioxidants and doesn’t turn to sugar, etc. so it’s okay, right?”

Most people do not drink pure ethanol. They consume beer, wine, mixed drinks and coolers that have added carbs.

Alcohol has 7 calories/gram and carbohydrates have 4 calories/gram. These calories have to go somewhere. Despite the fact that alcohol doesn’t turn into sugar or raise your insulin, the alcohol calories will turn into fat. Within one minute, alcohol is already in your bloodstream, up to your brain and to your liver.

Alcohol is a solvent. Your liver considers it to be a toxin. In the liver you have this enzyme that breaks alcohol down into a highly toxic chemical called acetaldehyde. It acts as a poison, killing brain cells and liver cells, causing oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis – and it leads to a fatty liver that is difficult, even impossible, to reverse.

Alcohol depletes your vitamins, dehydrates you, and blocks fat burning. Additionally, ethanol takes priority over burning fat. The liver focuses on ridding the body of alcohol instead.

There are no health benefits to drinking. It actually increases death. If you are okay with these risks, and understand that alcohol will also slow your weight-loss progress, then at least do not drink frequently, and do things to make up for the damage.

If you need a healthy alcohol substitute, you can consume kombucha tea.

## Can I Consume Berries On Keto

# Can I consume berries on keto?

Yes, in moderate amounts.

Berries are loaded with phytonutrients. These phytonutrients have some really interesting potential health properties.

A few potential health benefits of berries:

- They’re antioxidants

- They can help blood sugars

- They’re high in fiber

- They’re high in vitamin C

- They can help reduce inflammation

The best berries to have on keto (1 cup):

- Strawberry – net carbs 8.1 g, sugar 7 g

- Blueberry – net carbs 17.4 g, sugar 15 g

- Blackberry – net carbs 6 g, sugar 7 g

- Raspberry – net carbs 7 g, sugar 5 g

Dried berries can have as much as 132 g of net carbs and 80 g of sugar per cup. So fresh and frozen berries are keto-friendly, but dried berries are not keto-friendly and should be avoided.

## Can I Consume Slimfast Products On Keto

# Can I consume SlimFast products on keto?

The main issues with SlimFast products are:

1\. **Poor Ingredients**: They contain high-glycemic sugars (maltodextrin, dextrose), GMOs (soy, canola oil, beet sugar), synthetic vitamins, and caffeine, which aren't suitable for a ketogenic diet.

2\. **Snack-Based**: These products are marketed as snacks, leading to frequent blood sugar spikes that hinder weight loss and are incompatible with intermittent fasting.

3\. **Lack of Integrity**: SlimFast still produces products with high sugar content (18g per serving), which contradicts their mission to improve health during an ongoing sugar consumption epidemic.

Overall, SlimFast seems to be capitalizing on market trends for profit, rather than genuinely promoting health.

---

## Is Slimfast Safe To Consume On Keto

# Is SlimFast safe to consume on Keto?

The first problem with these products is the ingredient list. The ingredients include:

- Maltodextrin (110 on the glycemic index–sugar is only 70!)

- Dextrose (Synthetic sugar with the glycemic index of 100)

- Tapioca

- Soy (GMO)

- Canola oil (GMO)

- Synthetic vitamins (poorly absorbed)

- Caffeine

- Beet sugar (GMO)

These are poor-quality ingredients, which should have no place in a ketogenic diet.

A second problem with these products is that they are snack-based–meaning they are meant to be eaten as snacks or treats, like chips, bars and energy boosters. This isn’t compatible with intermittent fasting. Consistent blood sugar spikes will halt weight loss.

A final problem with SlimFast is their integrity. They are still producing the original SlimFast, which has 18 grams of sugar (beet sugar). We have a massive epidemic right now of people consuming too much sugar. Promoting more sugar consumption is not okay for a company that is supposed to be helping people improve their health.

Overall, it seems that SlimFast is just trying to tap into a trending market to make a big profit.

## How Many Grams Of Carbs Can I Eat Without Worrying About Insulin Resis 66A344

# How many grams of carbs can I eat without worrying about insulin resistance or high blood sugar?

The magic number is 50 net carbs. So don't go over 50 net carbs. That means you're minusing the fiber in some of the foods. But when we're talking about leafy green vegetables and salads, don't even count those. We want you to have more of those unless you're a bloater and you have some issues with that.

## Whats The Most Important Vitamin For Adrenal Glands

# What's the most important vitamin for adrenal glands?

The adrenal glands consist of an outer cortex (glandular tissue) and an inner medulla (neurological tissue). The medulla is involved in the fight-or-flight response of the sympathetic nervous system. The adrenal glands help the body adapt to stress. They contain the highest concentration of vitamin C among all glands, which is essential for the functioning of both the cortex and medulla.

Vitamin C acts as a co-factor for catecholamines (neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and adrenaline) and steroid hormones (like cortisol, aldosterone, and androgens), and serves as an antioxidant. Fatigue is a common symptom of both adrenal dysfunction and vitamin C deficiency. Increased stress raises the need for vitamin C, while refined carbohydrates can inhibit its utilization. Excellent sources of vitamin C include sauerkraut, bell peppers, leafy greens, and berries.

## Is Erythritol Bad

# Is erythritol bad?

A new study on erythritol and heart attacks has been in the news and found its way to social media—let’s talk about it. This study correlates erythritol in your blood to higher incidents of heart attacks and strokes. However, I see some serious problems with this study.

Here are four key points about this study:

1\. Correlation does not mean causation.

2\. This study was based on endogenous erythritol and did not measure dietary erythritol. The body makes endogenous erythritol.

3\. The body produces erythritol when you metabolize sugar, have oxidative stress or belly fat, or consume alcohol. The great majority of people in this study were in poor health, so how do we know erythritol was the problem?

4\. Other research has liked erythritol to many different health benefits. Could it be that erythritol is increasing in the body to counter the bad effects of sugar? It seems to me that erythritol is something that’s trying to help you and not hurt you.

## What Additional Strategies Can I Implement To Effectively Lower My Blo 8Ccbfc

# What additional strategies can I implement to effectively lower my blood sugar and cholesterol levels?

When managing diabetes and insulin resistance, understanding medications like metformin is key. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity, but if blood sugars remain high despite a low-carb diet, it could indicate that insulin receptors need further support or that the liver is producing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources.

To address this, stick to your current diet and consider adding supplements like berberine, apple cider vinegar, and cinnamon, as well as herbs like ginseng and turmeric to support liver function. Healing the liver can take time, sometimes up to three years, but with consistent efforts, you can improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control.

## What Are The Various Causes Of Vomiting And How Do Factors Such As Inf 23B0E2

# What are the various causes of vomiting, and how do factors such as infections, dietary issues, and medical conditions contribute to this symptom?

Nausea is discomfort and uneasiness that makes you want to throw up or vomit. Usually it’s a one-time event linked to something that doesn’t settle right in the stomach. Most of the time, vomiting is harmless, but if it’s recurring, it can be a sign of a more serious illness.

**Cause #1: Gallbladder problems / bile duct**

The gallbladder is a very important organ for your body as it stores bile. Bile is very important for our digestion and breakdown of fats. If you take something that your digestive system is not used to, this can overload your gallbladder ducts and cause confusion in your stomach. As a result you can feel nauseous.

**Other causes:**

- Motion sickness

- Food poisoning

- Chemotherapy

- Low blood sugar

- Medications/drugs

- Kidney stones

- Pregnancy

## How Does Prolonged High Blood Sugar Impact Nerve Health

# How does prolonged high blood sugar impact nerve health?

Suffering from sustained high blood sugar can cause damage to your motor or sensory nerves. The condition is called peripheral neuropathy. You can also have problems with the autonomic nerves and even the nerves to the eye. High blood sugar can also affect the blood vessels that innervate your nerves.

Taking more B-vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast supports the myelin sheath around the nerves. In addition, switching to a low carb diet like Healthy Keto® can be helpful in negating the side-effects of high blood sugar on the nerves.

## Is It Advisable For Those With Gilberts Syndrome To Follow A Ketogenic F41E5B

# Is it advisable for those with Gilbert's syndrome to follow a ketogenic diet and fasting?

When following a ketogenic diet, it's essential to prioritize nutrient-dense, high-quality ingredients, even if you have specific health conditions. Keto primarily involves reducing carbohydrate intake, but this does not inherently guarantee the use of healthy foods. Incorporating intermittent fasting alongside a well-structured ketogenic approach can enhance overall health benefits. In fact, I find it difficult to identify any scenarios where this combination would be contraindicated, even during pregnancy or lactation. However, while keto may be beneficial, intermittent fasting might not be appropriate for all individuals in those situations.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Skin Discoloration And How Do Factors 8D1087

# What are the potential causes of skin discoloration, and how do factors such as sun exposure, medical conditions, and hormonal changes contribute to this issue?

Discolored skin patches commonly develop in a certain part of the body due to a difference in melanin levels (melanin is a substance that gives color to the skin and protects it from the sun). Sometimes you may have darkened skin spots, or whitened. Each of these has its own causes and remedies.

**If you have dark skin spots**

There are few different hormonal causes for the irregular work of melanin resulting in darkened skin spots. Usually this means that melanin is overproduced in a certain area of the skin.

- Insulin is responsible for lowering the blood sugar levels in your body. Additionally, insulin increases the level of certain hormones called androgens, which are responsible for dark spots on the skin and for acne.

- If your body has excess estrogen that can be the reason for skin discoloration or dark spots, especially if intermittent fasting and a Healthy Keto diet didn’t resolve the skin condition.

- Cortisol is a hormone that is being produced when you are undergoing stress, whether mental or physical. If you have chronic stress, this will cause too-high cortisol, which can result in dark spots on your skin.

**If you have white skin spots (tinea versicolor)**

White skin patches are caused by the type of fungus that is called tinea versicolor. This fungus causes white/lighter spots on the skin, mainly on the chest and back. It does it by blocking melanin (the substance that is responsible for skin coloration).

## What Are The Potential Effects Of High Blood Sugar Levels On Nerve Health

# What are the potential effects of high blood sugar levels on nerve health?

There could be damage to your motor or sensory nerves. The condition is called peripheral neuropathy. You can also have problems with the autonomic nerves and even the nerves to the eye, and high blood sugar can also affect the blood vessels that innervate your nerves.

Dr. Berg recommends the ketogenic approach and intermittent fasting, including adding B-vitamins (from the nutritional yeast). B-vitamins also supports the myelin sheath around the nerves.

## Is There A Relationship Between The Consumption Of Red Meat And The De 978E9D

# Is there a relationship between the consumption of red meat and the development of fatty liver disease?

There's typically no direct connection between consuming high-quality, grass-fed red meat and developing a fatty liver. In fact, red meat contains nutrients like choline that can support liver health. Fatty liver conditions are often more closely linked to excessive carbohydrate intake and other dietary factors. It's important to consider your overall diet and lifestyle when addressing fatty liver concerns.

## What Are The Common Symptoms Associated With Prediabetes And How Can T 99E9E2

# What are the common symptoms associated with prediabetes, and how can these signs vary in intensity among different individuals?

**Prediabetes symptoms:**

1\. Darkened skin (in the body folds)

2\. Poor memory

3\. Tired after eating 

4\. Belly fat

5\. Hunger and cravings 

6\. Slow healing 

7\. Urination at night/increased thirst

8\. Dry mouth 

9\. Itchy

10\. Blurred vision 

The thing is, you could have all of these symptoms, and your blood sugar levels may still not be high. This is because, way before you get diabetes or even prediabetes, you have high insulin. You probably have high insulin from consuming a high-carb diet and eating too frequently. 

Too much insulin is toxic, so you will develop insulin resistance. This can go on for years until you eventually develop prediabetes and then diabetes.

## What Are The Most Common Factors And Dietary Habits That Contribute To C8A81C

# What are the most common factors and dietary habits that contribute to flatulence, and how do they affect digestive health?

**#1 Low stomach acidity:** Flatulence is hydrogen and methane gas created by microbes in the process of carbohydrate and fiber fermentation. Your stomach pH should be between 1 and 3—this is highly acidic. Without high stomach acidity, your digestive process is put under stress, causing many digestive issues.

The best remedies for low stomach acidity:

• Betaine hydrochloride

• Apple cider vinegar

**#2 Food intolerance:** Another cause of gas is food intolerance. Lactose intolerance is a common problem that happens when your body lacks the enzymes that break down lactose. In turn, this causes excess gas. You can avoid lactose or take enzymes that help break down lactose. Gluten intolerance is also common—if you’re on Healthy Keto®, you don’t have to worry about gluten or grains. Probiotics can help fortify your microbes and potentially increase enzyme production.

**#3 Gas-producing foods:** Avoid these common gas-producing foods:

• Fruit

• Beans

• Legumes

• Starches (like potatoes and rice)

• Sugar

• Certain cruciferous vegetables (Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage)

• Onions Instead, consume more:

• Lettuce

• Tomato

• Zucchini

• Olives

• Avocado

**#4 Sugar alcohols and fiber:** Keto-friendly low-calorie sweeteners, sugar alcohols, and fiber can cause digestive discomfort when consumed excessively. If you begin to experience gas, reduce your intake of these keto treats.

**#5 Chewing gum:** Chewing gum and chewing with your mouth open can cause you to swallow excess air. Avoid chewing with your mouth open.

**#6 Carbonated Soda:** Carbonated drinks can increase gas in your system, leading to flatulence.

## What Are The Benefits Of Turmeric Water

# What are the benefits of Turmeric Water?

Turmeric, the golden spice often used in curries, boasts a wide range of impressive health benefits, thanks largely to its active compound, curcumin. This powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant has been shown to provide relief in numerous areas:

- **Pain Relief:** Studies have found curcumin to be as effective as ibuprofen in reducing arthritis pain, and as effective as aspirin in general pain management, all without the unwanted side effects often associated with these medications.

- **Inflammation Reduction:** Curcumin has demonstrated similar effectiveness to Prednisone in reducing inflammation related to conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

- **Mood Support:** Research suggests curcumin may provide antidepressant effects comparable to Prozac and Zoloft.

- **Blood Sugar Regulation:** Curcumin exhibits anti-diabetic properties and effects similar to Metformin, aiding in blood sugar control.

- **Heart Health:** With benefits similar to statins, curcumin can help lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. It also possesses anticoagulant properties comparable to aspirin and Warfarin, potentially reducing the risk of blood clots.

- **Digestive Health:** Turmeric has proven to be as effective as anti-inflammatory drugs in managing irritable bowel disease and other digestive problems.

- **Additional Benefits:** Turmeric may help reduce blood pressure and inhibit the growth of pathogens, particularly fungi.

**Easy Ways to Enjoy Turmeric:**

- **Turmeric Water:** Combine ½ teaspoon turmeric powder, a pinch of black pepper, and the juice of half a lemon in a glass of warm water.

- **Golden Milk:** In a cup of milk or coconut milk, mix ½ teaspoon turmeric, ¼ teaspoon cinnamon, and a pinch of black pepper. Heat until just before boiling.

- **Smoothies:** Add turmeric to your favorite smoothie recipe, along with berries and kefir for a healthy boost.

- **Cough Remedy:** Soothe a cough with a cup of hot water containing a teaspoon of turmeric and a tablespoon of raw honey.

**Important Note:** While turmeric offers numerous potential benefits, it's essential to remember that it's not a replacement for conventional medical treatment. Always consult with your healthcare provider before using turmeric or any other supplement, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.

## How Can I Improve Gut Health With One Additional Microbe

# How can I improve gut health with one additional microbe?

## The Gut-Brain Connection and the Power of L. reuteri

Did you know that your gut and brain are in constant communication? The vagus nerve acts as a direct link between these two vital systems, influencing both your mental and physical well-being.

**The Gut-Brain Axis:**

- **A two-way street:** Just as anxiety and depression can disrupt your gut microbiome (the community of bacteria living in your digestive tract), an imbalance in your gut can trigger or worsen mood disorders.

- **Good bacteria are key:** A healthy microbiome strengthens your gut lining, aids digestion, and keeps harmful bacteria at bay.

- **Modern life can take a toll:** Factors like antibiotics, pesticides (such as glyphosate), processed foods, stress, alcohol, and pollution can damage your gut microbiome. This can lead to:

    - Reduced neurotransmitter production

    - Blood sugar imbalances

    - "Leaky gut" (increased intestinal permeability)

    - Inflammation

    - Allergies

    - Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)

**Harnessing the Power of L. reuteri:**

Dr. William Davis, inspired by the research of Dr. Irina Conboy, has developed a simple protocol for cultivating a powerful probiotic: **L. reuteri.** Studies in rats have shown that this beneficial bacteria can:

- Boost the immune system

- Enhance muscle tone and healing

- Exhibit anti-cancer properties

- Improve coat condition

- Increase mating behavior

Remarkably, these benefits extend to humans as well!

**DIY Probiotic Yogurt:**

Here's how to make your own L. reuteri yogurt:

1. **Create a paste:** Combine one L. reuteri probiotic tablet, inulin prebiotic fiber, and 2 tablespoons of organic half-and-half.

2. **Mix thoroughly:** Add a quart of organic half-and-half to the paste and mix well.

3. **Incubate:** Pour the mixture into a yogurt maker and incubate at 99 degrees Fahrenheit for 36 hours.

4. **Enjoy!** Consume half a cup of this probiotic-rich yogurt daily to support your gut health and overall well-being.

## Why Does Dr. Berg Use Synthetic Ingredients Such As Alpha Lipoid Acid

# Why does Dr. Berg use synthetic ingredients such as Alpha Lipoid Acid?

**Why Are Synthetic Ingredients Used in Dr. Berg’s Products?**

In the world of supplements, natural isn’t always better, and synthetic doesn’t mean unsafe or inferior. Synthetic ingredients are often chosen because they’re the only way to deliver precise, powerful, and proven results. Here’s why certain synthetic ingredients are used in Dr. Berg’s formulas:

**Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA)**

Clinically Supported Blend: The synthetic form (s-ALA) contains both R-ALA (the naturally occurring, active form) and S-ALA. This racemic mixture is the same form used in most clinical studies, which have shown benefits for blood sugar balance, antioxidant support, and nerve health.

Stable and Reliable: While R-ALA is more bioactive, it’s also unstable in isolation, which can reduce its effectiveness unless it’s carefully stabilized. The s-ALA blend ensures long-term stability, purity, and shelf life.

Effective: s-ALA delivers a consistent, research-backed dose of active ALA in a form your body can use, without the limitations of isolated R-ALA.

Bottom Line: While pure R-ALA may offer enhanced potency, the synthetic blend offers proven, practical support in a stable format used in most ALA research.

## Can Fruit Extracts Raise Blood Sugar Levels

# Can fruit extracts raise blood sugar levels?

Impact of Fruit Extracts on Blood Sugar [https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-only-sugar-that-wont-raise-your-blood-sugar](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-only-sugar-that-wont-raise-your-blood-sugar)

**Fructose Content**

Many fruit extracts contain fructose, a natural sugar. While fructose does not directly spike blood sugar levels like glucose, it is processed by the liver. Over time, excessive fructose consumption can lead to insulin resistance, which indirectly raises blood sugar levels.

**Glucose Content**

Some fruit extracts may also contain glucose, which directly increases blood sugar levels and triggers insulin release.

**Concentrated Sugars**

Fruit extracts are often concentrated, meaning they may contain higher levels of natural sugars compared to whole fruits. This concentration can lead to a more significant impact on blood sugar levels.

**Considerations for Managing Blood Sugar**

If you have conditions like Type 2 Diabetes or are managing blood sugar levels, it's essential to monitor the type and amount of fruit extracts consumed.

Opt for extracts with low or no added sugars and minimal fructose content.

Always check the nutritional label for sugar content and consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice.

## Is Pure Alcohol Keto Friendly

# Is pure alcohol keto-friendly?

You may have heard of keto-friendly wine or that pure alcohol is keto-friendly. Pure alcohol is not a carb or sugar and doesn’t directly increase your blood sugar or insulin. However, indirectly, it can create severe insulin resistance. Liver cells treat alcohol like poison and try to get rid of it. The toxicity of the alcohol injures the liver cells and can even kill them. During this process, you develop fat in the liver cells, which can lead to a fatty liver. With a fatty liver, you can also experience inflammation and scarring in the liver. Chronic inflammation and scarring can then cause cirrhosis and increase your risk of liver cancer and other liver problems. Alcohol also blocks your ability to burn fat. Don’t expect to burn fat for 48 to 72 hours after alcohol consumption. It’s a source of empty calories and depletes important nutrients.

You’ve probably heard that there are certain benefits of drinking alcohol in moderation. But, recently, they’ve found that was only a marketing tactic, and there are no benefits to drinking alcohol.

## How Can I Lose Weight Without Dieting

# How can I lose weight without dieting?

It's very difficult to lose even one pound of body fat without changing your diet. If you eat junk food, you’ll have to burn even more calories to burn extra fat. Weight loss is 15% exercise and 85% diet! You have to change your diet if you want to lose weight. There’s no way around it! Exercise improves fitness, muscle tone, and health, but it is not the key to weight loss and certainly won’t help you lose weight fast.

If you want to lose fat and not just water weight, you have to keep insulin low. Decreasing insulin will also decrease your appetite and cravings. To reduce insulin, you must go on a low-carb diet!

The carnivore diet involves eliminating all carbohydrates and eating meat, eggs, fish, and cheese. This simple diet can help you lose weight fast!

Intermittent fasting is the key to fat loss. It can also help with other health problems, such as inflammation, high blood pressure, diabetes, and depression. Remember, carbs block fat burning.

You can lose weight without changing your diet, but it won't be much!

## What Viral Health Tips Should I Not Try

# What viral health tips should I not try?

1\. Ear candling - This treatment has been debunked by a doctor of audiology! There is absolutely no difference in ear wax before and after ear candling.

2\. Gallbladder flush - This almost killed me! A gallbladder flush involves drinking 12 ounces of olive oil followed by beet tablets to eliminate gallstones. This really eliminates bile, causing you to become deficient. TUDCA is a much better remedy to help prevent and eliminate gallstones and bile sludge.

3\. The master cleanse - This cleanse combines lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and maple syrup, which won’t cleanse your body but will mess with your blood sugar.

4\. Foot detox pads - You can not pull toxins and heavy metals out of your feet as there are no detox pathways through the skin.

5\. Foot detox bath - Similar to foot detox pads, a chemical reaction changes the water's color during a foot detox bath, leading you to believe it’s pulling toxins out of your body.

6\. Ab belts - Stimulating the stomach muscles or sweating will not remove fat from your midsection. Visceral fat must be removed through diet and exercise.

7\. The blood type diet - This diet is not supported by credible research. Blood types relate more to an immune difference rather than a digestive difference.

8\. EMF blockers - A sticker on your cell phone can not block the EMF radiation it omits.

9\. Carb blockers - Carb blockers contain an extract that can inhibit the digestion of a minimal amount of starch, not sugar. You would need to take several bottles to inhibit the digestion of the starch from one donut.

10\. Psychiatric medication - The effectiveness of psychiatric medication can be comparable to placebo outcomes. They may also come with serious side effects and can be highly addictive.

## What Are Effective Strategies And Treatments For Decreasing Prostate E C65F04

# What are effective strategies and treatments for decreasing prostate enlargement, and how can they help manage symptoms and improve overall prostate health?

To address prostate enlargement, consider the following measures:

1\. **Limit Dairy Intake**: Dairy products can contain hormones that may negatively impact prostate health. Reducing dairy consumption may be beneficial.

2\. **Avoid Estrogenic Foods**: Steer clear of estrogenic substances, such as soy, which may influence prostate growth.

3\. **Manage Insulin Levels**: Reduce carbohydrate intake to lower insulin levels. High insulin levels can contribute to prostate enlargement due to its anabolic effects.

## What Foods Are Considered Poisonous

# What foods are considered poisonous?

**Beware of these seemingly healthy foods:**

1. **Granola Bars:** Nature Valley granola bars contain GMO ingredients, which are linked to the herbicide glyphosate, a potential carcinogen. They also contain high amounts of sugar, unhealthy seed oils, and refined starches.

2. **Agave Syrup:** Though often marketed as a healthier sweetener, agave syrup is actually 85% fructose. Fructose is processed by the liver like a toxin, and its excessive consumption can lead to health problems.

3. **Flavored Yogurt:** Despite being promoted as healthy, flavored yogurts are often loaded with sugar - sometimes even more than a candy bar! Many of the probiotics in them also won't survive stomach acid. Opt for whole-fat, Bulgarian, Greek yogurt, or kefir without added sugar instead.

4. **Non-Dairy Creamers:** While seemingly a healthy swap for milk, non-dairy creamers often contain unhealthy ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, glucose syrup, maltodextrin, and trans fats. Stick to regular cream or half-and-half, or choose non-dairy options without these ingredients.

5. **Soy Milk:** Soy products like soy milk can have estrogenic effects, which may lead to unwanted hormonal imbalances. Soy milk is also a highly processed food, unlike actual milk.

6. **Fast-Food Lettuce:** Salads may seem healthy, but fast-food lettuce is often coated in preservatives and washed in chlorine. Dressings are also usually packed with unhealthy ingredients.

7. **Puffed Cereals/Rice Cakes:** These highly processed foods offer little nutritional value. One chemist even observed rats dying after being fed puffed cereal!

**Remember:** It's always important to read the ingredients list carefully and choose whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible.

## Why Is The Blood Glucose Level Higher During Fasting Than Feeding

# Why is the blood glucose level higher during fasting than feeding?

Blood glucose levels may be higher while fasting than when you are feeding. Below are some potential reasons why. Please consult with a medical professional to determine if an underlying medical condition may affect your individual health outcomes.
Dawn phenomenon: This is a natural rise in blood glucose levels in the early morning hours, a process regulated by the release of counter-regulatory hormones like cortisol, growth hormone, and glucagon. If the fast ends in the morning, this could contribute to higher glucose levels, but it's a normal part of your body's function.

Gluconeogenesis: The liver produces glucose through gluconeogenesis to maintain blood sugar levels. This process can happen while feeding but is most increased at the 12-24 hour point of a fast, sometimes leading to a temporary increase in blood glucose.

Insulin resistance: Fasting can temporarily increase insulin resistance, which may result in higher blood glucose levels when the fast ends.

Stress response: Fasting is a form of stress on the body, which can trigger the release of stress hormones like cortisol. It's important to acknowledge that this can raise blood sugar levels, but it's a normal part of fasting.

Diet: Many foods have a glucose-lowering effect that may reduce blood sugars during feeding.

Individual variation: Some people may experience a paradoxical increase in blood glucose during fasting due to their unique physiology or underlying health conditions.

## What Are The Common Symptoms Of Tonsillitis And How Do They Impact Thr 564C88

# What are the common symptoms of tonsillitis, and how do they impact throat health and overall comfort?

Tonsillitis means inflamed tonsils. Tonsils are little glands on both sides of your inner throat. Tonsils are primarily involved in protecting your respiratory (breathing-related) organs from harmful microbes and viruses. In fact tonsils are the first line of your respiratory immune defense.

Symptoms:

- Infection in your throat

- Sore throat

- Inflamed tonsils

- Swollen throat

**Cause #1: High-carb diet**

Over years of practice I noticed a common characteristic of patients who had tonsil problems. Most of them were on a high-carb diet. Eating sugar and refined carbs will spike your insulin (fat- storing hormone), which in turn acts as an inflammatory hormone. This in itself can deplete your body of nutrients important for a healthy immune system.

**Cause 2: Weak immune system**

If you have a weak immune system, this can cause inflammation of your tonsils because they are part of it. Usually, tonsillitis is caused by viral or bacterial infection. Therefore, improving your ability to fight infections and bacteria will reduce the inflammation and improve the health of the body in general, including giving additional strength to your tonsils.

## Do You Have Salad Bloating Syndrome

# Do you have salad bloating syndrome?

Experiencing bloating after eating salad? You might be one of the many who suffer from Salad Bloating Syndrome. This discomfort isn't just about feeling full; it's often linked to Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) and leaky gut, both of which can lead to nutrient malabsorption and excessive fermentation in the gut.

**Trigger Foods and Dietary Adjustments**

Certain vegetables, particularly those high in lectins like tomatoes and peppers, can be problematic for individuals with increased gut permeability. These lectins can interfere with nutrient absorption and trigger bloating.

To manage symptoms, consider incorporating safe fats like pasture-raised meats, lard, and beef fat, known for their anti-inflammatory properties. Opt for gentler vegetables like cabbage and lettuce over cruciferous options like broccoli and Brussels sprouts.

**Probiotics and Turmeric**

Non-dairy probiotics can be a game-changer in preventing bloating. These beneficial bacteria help break down tough fibers, reducing gas production and promoting healthy digestion.

Turmeric, with its active compound curcumin, offers anti-inflammatory benefits and can help manage gastritis symptoms, often associated with bloating.

**Conclusion**

By understanding the causes and making informed dietary choices, you can manage Salad Bloating Syndrome effectively. Prioritize safe fats, opt for gentler vegetables, and incorporate probiotics and turmeric into your routine for a healthier, happier gut.

## Why Can A Fatty Liver Slow Your Thyroid   Hypothyroid

# Why Can a Fatty Liver Slow Your Thyroid - Hypothyroid?

Fatty liver disease can be caused by alcoholism, but it can also be caused by a diet rich in sugar and refined carbohydrates, with lots of frequent eating. This causes insulin spikes and can lead to insulin resistance.

These dietary choices lead to inflammation and scar tissue on the liver, eventually leading to a condition known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD).

A large abdomen or gut is one of the most common fatty liver signs, but the best way to identify a fatty liver is through ultrasound.

A fatty liver diminishes your liver function causing your cholesterol to go up, and your bile production to go down. When you don’t have enough bile, you can’t effectively remove cholesterol.

The thyroid gland produces the hormone T4, which is converted to T3 in the liver. A fatty liver causes problems with the thyroid because the liver is unable to convert T4 into T3, the active form of the thyroid hormone.

If you cannot convert enough T4 to T3, you will develop hypothyroidism. When you have a slow thyroid, you build up even more cholesterol. Hypothyroidism also slows down your metabolism and causes weight gain.

Keto and intermittent fasting address the root cause of these issues by improving the symptoms of insulin resistance. You can also increase your intake of cruciferous vegetables and all other vegetables to help reverse a fatty liver over time.

Choline is very efficient at removing fat from the liver, and can be taken as a supplement to support fatty liver disease.

## What Are The Primary Causes And Contributing Factors Associated With G Acd4F0

# What are the primary causes and contributing factors associated with Graves' disease?

Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid is producing too much thyroid hormone. In the whole thyroid-generating cycle there is no turn-off switch to the production of active thyroid hormone (T3) so it keeps being pumped out more and more.

Symptoms:

- Irritability

- Muscle weakness

- Sleeplessness

- Increased heart rate

- Heart hypertrophy

- Decreased tolerance to heat

- Diarrhea

- Eyes bulging out

- Tremor

- Panic and anxiety

**Cause #1: Graves’ disease (autoimmune)**

Graves disease is an autoimmune condition, which means that your own immune system attacks your own healthy body cells. This can affect your thyroid and can cause it to generate more active thyroid hormones than are needed, known as a hyperthyroid condition.

**Cause #2: Too much stress**

If you undergo consistent stress, this can cause a hyperthyroid condition and overaction
of your adrenal glands. This is because your adrenals (stress-regulating glands) support other glands, for example the thyroid. If your adrenals are burned out (because of consistent stress) it will affect your thyroid.

**Cause #4: High-carb diet**

If you consume a lot of carbs or you snack often, these can cause your body to produce insulin to lower the high amounts of blood sugar. Insulin is an inflammatory hormone, which means that the inflammation it creates can affect your thyroid, preventing it from working as it should.

## Whats Better To Consume On Keto Berries Or Fruits

# What's better to consume on Keto, berries or fruits?

Fruits are generally higher in sugar and lower in fiber than vegetables. However, berries offer a unique advantage: they have less sugar and a lower glycemic load. This means they're packed with fiber and phytonutrients that help manage blood sugar spikes.

Here's a quick comparison:

- **Blackberries (¾ cup):** 4g carbs (best choice!)

- **Raspberries (¾ cup):** Slightly higher in carbs

- **Strawberries (¾ cup):** Higher in carbs than blackberries and raspberries

- **Blueberries (¾ cup):** 12g carbs (still a decent option)

Compare this to other fruits:

- **Apple:** 25g carbs, 19g sugar

- **Peach:** 13g sugar, 12g carbs

- **Banana:** 27g carbs, 14g sugar

- **Grapes:** 16g carbs, 15g sugar

## What Lifestyle Changes Do I Need To Make To Reverse Type 2 Diabetes

# What lifestyle changes do I need to make to reverse Type 2 Diabetes?

While dietary changes are essential for reversing type 2 diabetes, other lifestyle factors can also have a significant impact on your blood sugar control and overall health. These include regular physical activity, stress management, and medication adjustments.

### **The Importance of Physical Activity**

Exercise is a powerful tool for managing type 2 diabetes. When you engage in physical activity, your muscles use glucose for energy, helping to lower your blood sugar levels.

Regular exercise also improves your insulin sensitivity, making it easier for your cells to respond to insulin signals.

Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming. Resistance training, such as weightlifting or bodyweight exercises, can also be beneficial for building muscle mass and improving insulin sensitivity.

## How Should I Time My Meals For Optimal Blood Sugar Control

# How should I time my meals for optimal blood sugar control?

In addition to choosing the right foods, timing your meals correctly can also play a significant role in managing hunger and blood sugar levels.

Aim to eat regular, balanced meals throughout the day, focusing on nutrient-dense foods that provide sustained energy.

Avoid skipping meals, which can lead to overeating later in the day and contribute to imbalances in blood sugar.

If you feel hungry between meals, reach for healthy snacks like vegetables with hummus, or a handful of nuts to tide you over until your next meal.

---

## How Late Night Snacks Affect Morning Appetite

# How Late-Night Snacks Affect Morning Appetite?

Eating close to bedtime can disrupt your body's natural circadian rhythms and affect blood sugar levels throughout the night. When you consume food late at night, especially carbohydrate-rich snacks, your body releases insulin to process the glucose.

However, as you sleep, your body's insulin sensitivity decreases, which can lead to higher blood sugar levels.

As the night progresses, your blood sugar levels may drop, triggering a rebound effect in the morning. This can make you wake up hungrier than usual, even if you ate a substantial amount the night before.

To avoid this cycle, it's best to avoid eating large meals or snacks close to bedtime and instead focus on balanced, nutrient-dense foods throughout the day.

## What Are The Dietary Habits That Cause Gallstones

# What are the dietary habits that cause gallstones?

## **Dietary Habits Leading to Gallstone Formation**

Regarding gallstones, the food you eat plays a crucial role. Contrary to popular belief, certain dietary habits contribute more to gallstone formation than fat consumption.

Eating too many grains and sugars can cause a spike in insulin, resulting in depleted bile stores and thus raising the possibility of gallstone formation.

### **Impact of Grains on Insulin Levels**

The impact that grains have on our bodies is often underestimated. They are broken down into glucose during digestion, which then causes your blood sugar levels to rise rapidly.

This triggers your pancreas to release insulin - a hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels by facilitating glucose absorption into cells. However, consuming large amounts of grains regularly leads our body into a state known as insulin resistance.

In this condition, our cells become less responsive or resistant to insulin, making them unable to absorb glucose efficiently, causing high blood sugar and elevated insulin levels in the bloodstream.

This chronic elevation in insulin level is harmful to overall health and contributes significantly towards the depletion of bile reserves, thus paving the way for potential gallstone formation.

### **Sugar Consumption and Gallstone Formation**

Sugar consumption is not only linked to numerous health issues but also potentially gallstone formation. While sugar's relationship with gallstones isn't widely discussed, it is equally concerning.

- **Increase in Insulin Levels:** Like grains, excessive intake of sugars, significantly refined ones like white table sugar or high fructose corn syrup, causes rapid spikes in blood glucose, triggering an increased insulin secretion from the pancreas, resulting in higher circulating levels over time. This heightened level depletes bile, making one susceptible to forming stones within the gallbladder.

- **Promotes Weight Gain:** High consumption of sugars, particularly those found within processed foods, often leads to weight gain due to their empty calorie content devoid of any substantial nutrients yet packed full of energy (calories). Being overweight or obese increases the likelihood of developing cholelithiasis (gallstones).

**Tips To Minimize the Risk Of Gallstones Through Diet**

1. Avoid consuming excess carbohydrates straightforward carbs like sugary drinks, sweets, etc. Opt instead for low-carb foods rich in healthy fats to provide a steady energy supply without causing drastic fluctuations in your blood sugar and insulin levels.

2. Maintain a healthy weight through a nutritious low-carb diet like Healthy Keto. Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of cholesterol stones, the most common type of stone seen in patients suffering from this ailment. Losing even a small amount of weight, if overweight or obese, could potentially reduce the chances of getting affected by this painful condition.

## Why Do People Have A Resistance To Keto

# Why do people have a resistance to Keto?

## **Understanding Resistance to Keto**

Exploring why some resist the ketogenic lifestyle—due to misconceptions, social influences, and ingrained habits—can help individuals overcome these barriers and unlock keto’s benefits.

**Perception of Health Without Problems**

Many people mistakenly believe they’re in perfect health, overlooking the need for dietary changes. This mindset can hinder acceptance of the keto diet. Even though keto offers health and weight loss benefits, convincing those who feel healthy can be challenging, especially when symptoms aren't apparent. Sharing success stories and research about keto’s preventive benefits can help change this perception.

**The Challenge of Invisible Health Issues**

Invisible health problems often go unnoticed until they become serious. Conditions like prediabetes or insulin resistance may not present obvious symptoms. By gently guiding friends and family to recognize these hidden risks, we can show how keto can combat inflammation and stabilize blood sugar.

**Identifying the Real Issue**

Understanding the core issue is crucial for finding effective solutions. Whether in relationships, work, or health, identifying underlying factors allows for targeted interventions and proactive steps.

**Beyond Weight Loss**

When discussing keto, it’s essential to look beyond just weight loss. Hesitations may arise from unseen struggles like chronic fatigue or medical conditions. By uncovering these issues, we can foster meaningful conversations about keto’s broader benefits, focusing on overall well-being and addressing concerns that may not be immediately visible.

### **The Crucial Role of Vegetables**

Shedding light on how veggies, crucial for their nutrient-rich profiles and ability to fill you up, play an indispensable role in a low-carb diet.

Vegetables aren't just the colorful side characters on your plate; they're nutrient-dense superheroes fighting off hunger. When you skimp on these, especially in a low-carb diet, you might find yourself constantly raiding the fridge.

Veggies are packed with fiber and essential nutrients that help keep us whole.

This isn't just about filling up your stomach; it's about giving your body what it needs to function optimally. A lack of sufficient nutrient intake can leave you hungry no matter how much you eat. So next time, maybe let kale join the party, too.

### **Addressing Nutrient Absorption Issues**

How insulin resistance and gallbladder or liver issues can affect nutrient absorption and satisfaction.

If eating more vegetables still leaves you wanting snacks, consider this: Maybe it's not what you eat but how your body handles it. Insulin resistance and gallbladder or liver issues can throw a wrench into nutrient absorption processes.

Facing such challenges doesn’t mean defeat; understanding them is step one toward adjusting your approach for better health outcomes.

Chatting with a health expert about these hurdles might be the secret sauce to mastering your appetite and maintaining a low-carb way of life.

## Is There Any Maltodextrin In Keto Foods

# Is there any maltodextrin in Keto foods?

## **The Hidden Truth About Maltodextrin in Keto Foods**

Maltodextrin sneaks into keto-friendly foods, masquerading as an innocent additive. But don't be fooled. With a glycemic index soaring at 110, it's anything but friendly to your ketosis goals, outranking even table sugar on the blood sugar spike meter.

Most troubling is its origin story—often derived from corn or wheat that's been genetically modified (GMO). This means not only are you grappling with potential blood sugar issues, but you're also possibly consuming GMOs and glyphosate residues without realizing it.

If staying in [ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-know-you-are-in-ketosis) matters to you, reading labels becomes more than a habit; it's your shield against hidden disruptors like maltodextrin. Opt for whole-food ingredients and sidestep this unwelcome guest hiding in your so-called "keto" treats.

## **Dextrose: The Hidden Sugar Impacting Ketosis**

Imagine you're on a keto diet, carefully picking your foods to stay in ketosis. But here's the kicker: some "keto-friendly" products might pull the wool over your eyes with dextrose.

This sweet devil has a glycemic index of 100, which is like inviting sugar to crash your low-carb party uninvited.

[Dextrose](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-a-product-with-dextrose-still-be-keto) sneaks into various foods under the guise of being harmless or even beneficial. Yet, its high glycemic index means it can spike [blood sugar levels](https://www.drberg.com/blog/blood-sugar-levels-high-despite-keto-and-fasting) fast and hard, throwing you out of ketosis quicker than you can say "carbs." Here’s why that matters for keto followers.

This synthetic sugar is often found where you least expect it - from processed meats to salad dressings. The necessity of diligently scrutinizing labels and opting for unadulterated, natural edibles becomes evident due to their ubiquity.

## **The Deceptive Nature of Maltitol in Keto Products**

Maltitol might seem like a keto dream come true, but it's more of a wolf in sheep's clothing. With a glycemic index ranging from 57 to 70, maltitol isn't as innocent as it appears.

For perspective, pure glucose sits at the top with an index of 100. Maltitol, though seemingly harmless, can still cause a surge in your blood sugar, jeopardizing your state of ketosis.

### **Glucose Content in Maltitol**

Buckle up because here’s where things get tricky: half of maltitol is glucose. Yes, that molecule with a glycemic index score hitting the roof at 100. If staying in ketosis was your goal, maltitol could be secretly sabotaging your efforts without you even realizing it.

## Is A Higher Glucose Level Normal When Testing Outside Of The Fasting Window

# Is a higher glucose level normal when testing outside of the fasting window?

A higher glucose level outside of the fasting window is generally expected, especially after consuming carbohydrates. However, if blood sugar remains elevated when not eating, it could indicate underlying insulin resistance or other factors. For example, morning glucose spikes can result from cortisol release, which mobilizes stored sugar. Additionally, exercise can temporarily raise blood sugar levels.

To assess long-term glucose control, A1C testing is more informative, as it reflects average blood glucose over three months. To manage higher blood sugar, consider regular exercise, using diluted apple cider vinegar, and incorporating supplements like berberine to support insulin sensitivity.

## Can The Ketogenic Diet Have An Impact On Thyroid Function

# Can the ketogenic diet have an impact on thyroid function?

When following a well-structured and healthy ketogenic diet, thyroid function is generally not compromised. In fact, a properly implemented ketogenic approach can enhance metabolic efficiency, potentially reducing the need for higher levels of thyroid hormones. While you may observe slight decreases in T4 or T3 levels, these fluctuations typically remain within the normal range.

Hypothyroidism is commonly diagnosed through measurements of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is regulated by the pituitary gland. TSH levels are likely to remain stable when following a nutritious, low-carbohydrate diet. Therefore, there is usually no cause for concern regarding thyroid function while adhering to a healthy ketogenic lifestyle. If you have specific concerns about your thyroid health, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

## What Strategies Can I Implement To Alleviate Nighttime Acid Reflux

# What strategies can I implement to alleviate nighttime acid reflux?

To effectively alleviate nighttime acid reflux, it is essential to minimize the consumption of sugary foods, as they can exacerbate imbalances and worsen symptoms. Implementing a ketogenic diet along with intermittent fasting may prove beneficial in managing this condition. For further guidance, resources such as DrBerg.com provide valuable insights into dietary modifications that can lead to significant relief within a week. Additionally, consulting with a healthcare professional for tailored advice is recommended to address acid reflux effectively.

## What Can I Do For Shakiness While Fasting

# What can I do for shakiness while fasting?

Shakiness during fasting often results from rapid adjustments in blood sugar levels. To address this, consider gradually easing into fasting rather than making abrupt changes, particularly if you are new to intermittent fasting or ketogenic diets. Allow your body to adapt at its own pace.

Additionally, ensure your carbohydrate intake remains low when you are not fasting. High carb consumption can prolong the adaptation period and exacerbate low blood sugar symptoms. Maintaining a consistent, low-carb diet will help stabilize blood sugar levels and ease the transition.

## What Supplements Are Good For Someone With Celiac Disease

# What supplements are good for someone with celiac disease?

For someone with celiac disease, a no-grain diet is essential. Consider temporarily avoiding all fibers and following a carnivore diet to reduce gut inflammation. Additionally, cabbage juice can be beneficial due to its properties that help heal ulcers and reduce inflammation in the digestive system.

## What Can I Do For Prostate Issues

# What can I do for prostate issues?

For individuals experiencing prostate issues, it is important to consider the potential impact of dairy consumption. Dairy products can elevate hormonal levels, including estrogen, which may contribute to prostate enlargement. Reducing or eliminating dairy, particularly milk and certain cheeses, could alleviate some symptoms.

Additionally, many men report frequent nighttime urination, often attributed to prostate enlargement. However, implementing intermittent fasting and reducing carbohydrate intake—particularly by avoiding late-night snacking—can significantly improve urinary retention. Transitioning to two meals or even one meal per day may enable better bladder control, allowing for uninterrupted sleep. This shift in dietary habits may reveal that the underlying issue is related to insulin resistance rather than solely a prostate condition.

---

## Can Fasting Mess With A Womans Hormones

# Can fasting mess with a woman’s hormones?

Fasting can actually promote a sense of calm and reduce stress, as it often leads to a state of increased tolerance and serenity. Some concerns arise from the temporary increase in cortisol levels, a counter-regulatory hormone, when blood sugar levels drop due to not eating. However, this is typically not an issue once the body adapts to fasting and enters ketosis, usually within two to three days. At this point, the body efficiently runs on fat as fuel instead of relying solely on blood sugar, stabilizing cortisol levels. The key is to adapt to a ketogenic diet, which helps maintain hormonal balance during fasting.

## Can Neuropathy Be Reversed With Intermittent Fasting

# Can neuropathy be reversed with intermittent fasting?

Neuropathy may be reversible with intermittent fasting, though it also depends on your diet when you're not fasting. Intermittent fasting is a powerful tool for addressing issues related to glucose and insulin, as fasting naturally reduces sugar intake. This reduction can significantly benefit the nervous system and help alleviate conditions associated with diabetes.

---

## Is Cantaloupe Juice Beneficial

# Is cantaloupe juice beneficial?

While cantaloupe juice contains valuable nutrients, its high sugar content, especially when juiced, poses concerns. Juicing removes the fiber that helps regulate sugar absorption, leading to a direct intake of fructose, which may not be ideal, particularly for those managing blood sugar levels. I’ve learned from personal experience—once juicing large amounts of carrot juice until noticing a skin color change—that moderation is key. Cleanses involving sugary juices or glucose can prevent full adaptation to ketosis, making fasting more challenging and intensifying cravings. For effective cleansing and fasting, it's crucial to consider the impact of sugar and opt for methods that support metabolic balance.

## What Could Be Causing Diarrhea While Following A Carnivore Diet

# What could be causing diarrhea while following a carnivore diet?

While following a carnivore diet can be beneficial for some, persistent diarrhea may indicate that your gut microbiota is not being adequately supported. Microbes primarily thrive on fiber from vegetables, which serves as their main fuel source and acts as a prebiotic. While animal products can provide some nutrients, they do not fulfill the prebiotic role.

If you are on a carnivore diet due to existing gut issues, it’s crucial to ensure you’re approaching it correctly. Simply consuming meat may not be sufficient. Incorporating a variety of animal products, such as eggs, fish, organ meats, and shellfish, can provide a broader range of nutrients and support gut health more effectively.

## Can I Be Thin And Have Insulin Resistance

# Can I be thin and have insulin resistance?

Insulin resistance can affect individuals of all body types, including those who are thin and struggle to gain weight. It can impact blood sugar levels, mood, cognitive function, and may lead to fatty liver, which isn't always apparent physically.

When following a ketogenic diet, especially when combined with fasting, maintaining weight can be challenging.

---

## Is There A Connection Between Diet Soda And Elevated Glucose Levels

# Is there a connection between diet soda and elevated glucose levels?

I believe artificial sweeteners can have an indirect impact on health, particularly through their effects on the microbiome. Alterations in the microbiome can lead to insulin resistance and various issues related to blood sugar regulation. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that artificial sweeteners may contribute to these metabolic concerns.

## Am I Potentially Consuming An Excessive Amount Of Dietary Fat

# Am I potentially consuming an excessive amount of dietary fat?

Let's just talk about dietary fat. If you were to eat fat, let's say you ate so much fat per day, and with that fat you had some carbohydrates, now we're going to just go storage, storage, storage. Because your body's only running on glucose, and you can't tap into that reserve. When you're in keto, now you can actually burn the fat. Now does that mean you can just eat unlimited fat and it's all going to get burned? No.

Here's various factors. Number one, your age, your metabolism, how much insulin resistance you have, which will determine how much fat you'll have actually being burned. So it's kind of, there's just, it's hard to give you more of an answer than that.

That's just the general concept. But if you do this and you notice, wow, not losing weight, even though you're in ketosis, because those ketones could be coming from dietary fat, it really, probably the best way to determine if it's being stored is if you're gaining weight, which is going to be very unlikely. You just might not be losing as much weight.

So there is a point of like too much fat. So does fat get stored like a carbohydrate would get stored because of a carbohydrate? No. What determines whether it gets stored is two things. One is how much of that fat you're using as energy or not, and then also what's going on with your insulin levels. It really depends on if you're doing carbs with that fat, right? That's really the key. If you keep your carbs really, really low, I mean like if you like, if it's zero and you're doing fat, it's very unlikely you're going to be burning that fats.

A good amount of it will be eliminated through the digestive system as well, but it's not(4:51) just going to be converted over there because the pathway of the metabolism of fat is actually (4:59) very different than glucose.

## Is Kombucha Considered Healthy And What Are Its Potential Benefits And 02Da93

# Is kombucha considered healthy, and what are its potential benefits and risks for overall well-being?

You got to be careful about kombucha because a while ago you could find it with two grams of sugar. But nowadays you read the label what's 12 grams of sugar, 16 grams of sugar. That's a lot of sugar because they make it out of sugar and they make it out of sugar and black tea. So I think the acids in there do help the digestive system.

There's some better digestive fermented products. Things like kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi. But let's say for example, you have someone of a craving for alcohol, kombucha tea is a good alternative because it gives you the texture, it gives you the calmness, and it's kind of like a carbonated beverage that you can pretend like you're drinking a beer and create similar effects.

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies For Reversing Type 2 Diabetes

# What are the most effective strategies for reversing Type 2 diabetes?

To effectively reverse type 2 diabetes, focus on dietary changes aimed at reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake. By adopting a low-carb diet, you can improve insulin sensitivity, which helps lower blood glucose levels. This approach shifts your metabolism toward burning fat for energy, easing the strain on the pancreas and potentially reducing the need for medication over time. Monitoring your progress and working closely with healthcare providers are essential steps in managing and potentially reversing type 2 diabetes through dietary modifications.

## Im Addicted To Sugar But I Feel Great When Im On Keto. I Want To Lose  Af525E

# I'm addicted to sugar but I feel great when I'm on Keto. I want to lose weight - any word of advice?

Now we have to pretend that sugar is scarce. And so you have to do all sorts of things from not buying it, you know, cleaning out your sugar from your house. In fact, I think that would be a really good thing to do.

Go through all your cupboards, your refrigerator and remove all the sugar, get it out because, that late night when you're craving and you're going to your fridge and you're debating whether you're going to drive to the store or not, but you got to drive. So that will discourage you.

But the other thing too, is that once you get off sugar, okay, it might take a week or two, but then you're going to adapt to fat burning and your cravings will go away unless you eat them again.

And the other thing too is just the attitude of being in charge of your body. Because your body will give you all sorts of crazy messages like I want that donut over there.

## What Stops Me From Losing Belly Fat

# What stops me from losing belly fat?

**One of the top things that will stop you from losing belly fat is alcohol consumption. You may have heard of keto-friendly wine or that pure alcohol is keto-friendly. Pure alcohol is not a carb or sugar and doesn’t directly increase your blood sugar or insulin. However, indirectly, it can create severe insulin resistance.**

Liver cells treat alcohol like poison and try to get rid of it. The toxicity of the alcohol injures the liver cells and can even kill them. During this process, you develop fat in the liver cells, which can lead to a fatty liver.

**With a fatty liver, you can also experience inflammation and scarring in the liver.** Chronic inflammation and scarring can then cause cirrhosis and increase your risk of liver cancer and other liver problems. Alcohol also blocks your ability to burn fat. Don’t expect to burn fat for 48 to 72 hours after alcohol consumption. It’s a source of empty calories and depletes important nutrients.

You’ve probably heard that there are certain benefits of drinking alcohol in moderation. But, recently, they’ve found that was only a marketing tactic, and there are no benefits to drinking alcohol.

**Alcohol also has negative effects on other parts of the body, including:**

• The brain

• The endocrine system

• The gut microbiome

• The heart

• Estrogen production in men (increases estrogen and decreases testosterone)

It’s crucial to realize the negative effects of alcohol and consider the real reasons you’re drinking alcohol, like stress. Many natural things can help you reduce stress. If you can’t give up alcohol, try diluting it with sparkling water. If you take milk thistle before drinking, it can help protect the liver against poison and can help support the liver. Kombucha tea with low amounts of sugar is also a great alternative to alcohol and gives you a nice, relaxed feeling.

## How Much Alcohol Do People Really Drink

# How much alcohol do people really drink?

Alcohol consumption varies globally and by gender, with notable impacts on health:

\- In the United States, average alcohol consumption is 2.5 gallons (9.5 liters) per person annually.

\- In Nigeria, it's 3.4 gallons (13 liters), and in Belarus, 4.6 gallons (17.5 liters).

Despite these averages, consumption patterns vary widely: 30% of Americans abstain, 30% drink infrequently, and 10% have high daily intake.

Alcohol's drawbacks include liver damage, nutrient depletion, and increased stress.

Healthy alternatives include low-sugar kombucha tea and regular intake of nutritional yeast.

## Does Eating Fat Lower Cholesterol

# Does eating fat lower cholesterol?

Your body makes 3000 milligrams of cholesterol each day. That’s the equivalent of 14 eggs or a pound of butter every single day. If you lower your dietary cholesterol, your body will make more to compensate.

**High-fat diets are often associated with high cholesterol, but fat isn’t the problem! Low-fat diets are also high in carbohydrates, which spike insulin and raise cholesterol. A high-fat diet like keto is an ideal diet for a healthy cholesterol level.**

On keto, it is still important to avoid unhealthy fats like trans fats, hydrogenated oils, soy oils, and deep-fried foods. Instead, opt for healthier fatty foods.

**Here are a few examples:**

•Avocado

•Nuts

•Grass-fed meat

•Grass-fed dairy

•Grass-fed butter

•Wild-caught fish

•Cod liver oil

These healthy fats are not harmful to your cholesterol or your heart. A low-carb, high-fat diet can prevent insulin spikes and help lower cholesterol. The majority of the population will experience lowered cholesterol by following a low-carb diet. As fat cells release stored fat, you may notice a temporary increase in blood cholesterol levels when you begin a ketogenic diet, but remember this is only temporary. Try keto for one month and check your cholesterol levels!

## Do The Same Rules Of Keto Apply To A Type 1 Diabetic

# Do the same rules of Keto apply to a type 1 diabetic?

I just interviewed someone on this one topic. But he was a fascinating interview, this doctor who actually not, not only was he a type one diabetic, but he ran 20 miles five days in a row and on no calories. He fasted for five days and he did fine.

**So the same rules apply, same rules apply. There's all this false information that we need more carbs if we're a type one diabetic for some reason, but then you're going to just take more insulin. The whole goal is to take the least amount of insulin because that extra insulin creates more problems.**

So yeah, it's the same, same rules. But of course, because you don't have insulin, then you have no way of controlling your carbs when you eat. So you have to monitor that level.

**And there's one condition with type one diabetes that we should bring up. It's called diabetic ketoacidosis.** And that's a situation where you forget to take your insulin and you're a type one and your ketones are out of control.They go way, way, way too high. But that condition is not going to occur if you control your blood sugars with your medication. And it's definitely not going to occur if you're not a diabetic.

## Does Gluten Free Count As Keto

# Does gluten-free count as Keto?

I believe gluten is harmful, and a person should try to avoid it. However, just because something is gluten-free, this doesn’t mean it’s not going to raise your insulin.

For example, grains like wheat might be gluten-free, but it’s still going to affect your blood sugars. Gluten-free grains are better, in my opinion, than grains with gluten. But, it’s important to consume a low-carb diet (20-50g of carbs per day). A person could consume gluten-free grains in small amounts as long as they stick to only having 20-50g of carbs per day.

## How To Determine If Im Addicted To Sweets

# How to determine if I'm addicted to sweets?

First, let’s talk about the differences between an addiction and a habit. Some people who crave sweets don’t realize that they are addicted. They may just say that they “love sweets.”

An addiction is something that you feel like you cannot live without. For instance, if you couldn’t have sweets for a day, would you go crazy, or would you be alright? A habit is something you could go without, but if you have the option, you would most likely choose to have sweets.

The first step is to acknowledge you have an addiction. Keep in mind that sweets are so addicting, they are even more addicting than drugs.

The problem many people make is going on a diet and trying to quit sweet things altogether. You have to have a substitute first. You can use numerous other sweeteners that will give you the same satisfaction that sugar does, but without the blood sugar spikes. Stevia is a common natural sweetener that you can use.

Over time, your body will readapt to having lower amounts of sugar. In fact, you’ll stop feeling sugar cravings. You’ll also reverse insulin resistance.

## Can The Ketogenic Diet Spike Cortisol

# Can the Ketogenic Diet spike cortisol?

Insulin resistance is a situation where the body compensate the excess carb and sugar in the diet and it is protecting itself against it. When you have higher insulin, it is going to push the blood sugars on the lower side.

**Functions of Cortisol:**

1\. Protect against hypoglycemia or low blood sugar.

2\. It stimulates Gluconeogenesis.

## Are Konjac Noodles Keto Friendly

# Are Konjac noodles keto-friendly?

Other names for konjac noodles are miracle noodles or shirataki noodles. Konjac noodles are keto-friendly. They are 97% water and 3% fiber. Fiber is a carb, but it doesn’t have any effect on insulin. 

**This type of fiber can have some interesting effects, including:**

• It may act as a detox 

• It may help support weight loss

• It may help loosen mucus 

Something to keep in mind about these noodles is that they are flavorless. So, you’ll have to add things to them to make them flavorful. These noodles do not have the same texture as pasta noodles, but they’re similar. You may also get very thirsty if you consume these noodles. 

**Benefits of konjac noodles:**

• They can decrease hunger

• They may help stabilize your blood sugars

• They may help decrease constipation 

• They don’t have any calories 

**Other keto pasta alternatives:** 

• Spaghetti squash 

• Zucchini noodles

## Why Do Triglycerides Elevate On Keto

# Why do triglycerides elevate on keto?

Your fat is a storage place for triglycerides. When you do keto and enter a state of ketosis, the triglycerides are mobilized, and they come out of the fat cell. They’re there to be used as energy.  I believe fasting 12-14 hours before you get your triglycerides tested is very important. This way, the test isn’t affected by what you just ate or drank that may have temporarily caused your triglycerides to be higher. Consuming alcohol or carbs two days before the test can also cause your triglycerides to be temporarily high. 

**A few potential causes of high triglycerides:** 

• A hypothyroid condition 

• A problem with the gallbladder 

• The transitional phase of keto 

• Hidden carbohydrates 

• Hidden fats

## How Does Chronic Worry Negatively Impact Physical Health

# How does chronic worry negatively impact physical health?

Being in fight-or-flight mode, having elevated cortisol and adrenaline for a long period, isn’t healthy.

**Chronic stress has been known to negatively affect the body in many ways, including:**

• Shrinking your grey matter

• Shrinking your thymus gland

• Creating muscle atrophy

• Decreasing testosterone

• Running the body on sugar (even when you’re not eating sugar)

• Disrupting healthy digestion

• Reducing quality sleep

Chronic worry and stress can also lead to ulcers, inflammation, and disease. An interesting study measured 39 people’s cortisol levels before and after a 45-minute art therapy session. This study found a significant reduction of cortisol in participants. I have found that hobbies are a fantastic way to stop the fixation on stress and move your attention to something more positive.

A new study on erythritol and heart attacks has been in the news and found its way to social media—let’s talk about it. This study correlates erythritol in your blood to higher incidents of heart attacks and strokes. However, I see some serious problems with this study.

**Here are four key points about this study:**

1\. Correlation does not mean causation.

2\. This study was based on endogenous erythritol and did not measure dietary erythritol. The body makes endogenous erythritol.

3\. The body produces erythritol when you metabolize sugar, have oxidative stress or belly fat, or consume alcohol. The great majority of people in this study were in poor health, so how do we know erythritol was the problem?

4\. Other research has linked erythritol to many different health benefits. Could it be that erythritol is increasing in the body to counter the bad effects of sugar? It seems to me that erythritol is something that’s trying to help you and not hurt you.

## What Specific Dermatological Signs Can Indicate Diabetes

# What specific dermatological signs can indicate diabetes?

High blood glucose affects the skin both directly and indirectly. Insulin, a hormone that helps lower glucose, can also affect the skin. When you have high blood glucose, you’ll typically also have high insulin and insulin resistance, at least in the beginning.

**Skin conditions that can be related to high blood sugar:**

1\. Petechiae and purpura

2\. Gangrene

3\. Ulcers in the legs or feet

4\. Swollen red eyelids

**The best remedies for skin conditions related to diabetes:**

• Get on the Healthy Keto® diet

• Do intermittent fasting

• Consume one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar mixed in water a few times a day

• Take berberine

## Can I Add Honey To The Apple Cider Vinegar Drink

# Can I add honey to the apple cider vinegar drink?

About 56% of honey is fructose, and 44% of it is glucose. Honey has a glycemic index of 78, which is high.

The problem with fructose is that only the cells in the liver can deal with it. So, fructose puts a lot of stress on the liver and can create a lot of problems.

If you had to choose between honey ad sugar, honey might be the better option because it has some antioxidants and some antimicrobial properties. It may also help with certain allergies. But, overall, honey is low in actual nutrients. It may be better than refined sugar, but not by much.

So, is it a good idea to mix honey and apple cider vinegar? No.

## Can Eating Salad Contribute To Weight Gain

# Can eating salad contribute to weight gain?

Hidden carbs from croutons, dried fruit, or salad dressings can cause weight gain, but if you're following keto and intermittent fasting, they are likely not the issue.

Increased salad intake may lead to digestive issues if your body lacks the necessary microbes and enzymes. Vegetables contain two types of fiber: soluble (retains water) and insoluble (does not). Inadequate fiber breakdown can slow digestion and cause water retention, leading to weight gain.

To prevent this, try:

1\. Steaming vegetables to break down fiber.

2\. Choosing easier-to-digest vegetables like squash, cauliflower, broccoli, and asparagus.

3\. Gradually increasing vegetable intake to build up gut microflora.

This approach helps reduce bloating and water retention while your body adjusts to digesting fiber efficiently.

## How Can Fatty Liver Disease Contribute To A Slowdown In Thyroid Function

# How can fatty liver disease contribute to a slowdown in thyroid function?

Fatty liver disease can stem from excessive alcohol consumption or a diet high in sugars and refined carbohydrates, leading to insulin spikes and insulin resistance. This condition, known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), causes liver inflammation and scar tissue formation.

Common signs include abdominal obesity and can be diagnosed via ultrasound, revealing diminished liver function and reduced bile production. A fatty liver impairs cholesterol regulation and interferes with thyroid hormone conversion (T4 to T3), potentially leading to hypothyroidism and metabolic slowdown.

Addressing these issues with a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting can alleviate insulin resistance symptoms. Increasing intake of cruciferous and other vegetables, along with choline supplements, supports the removal of fat from the liver, aiding in the reversal of fatty liver disease over time.

## What Are The Potential Health Benefits Associated With Gymnema

# What are the potential health benefits associated with gymnema?

Gymnema is a woody climbing shrub grown in India and Africa. It’s leaves are often used
to make medicine. Gymnema has a long history of use in India’s medicine. The Hindi name for gymnema means “destroyer of sugar” because of its property of neutralizing the sweet sensation.

**Benefits**

1. Supports the cells of pancreas

2. Improves blood sugars

3. Reduces sugar and carb cravings

4. Potent antidiabetic properties

5. Creates a hypoglycemic effect (lowers the blood sugar)

6. Neutralizes sweet sensation

7. Improves insulin resistance

8. Reverses damage for beta-cells

**How to consume it**

You can take it as a supplement following the recommended directions. You can also put it on the tongue and it will improve your blood sugars. It will make you temporarily unable to taste sweetness.

**Where to get it**

You can buy it at a health food store or order it online.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Panic Attacks

# What are the potential causes of panic attacks?

**Cause #1: High amounts of stress**

High amounts of stress can cause your adrenals (stress-regulating glands) to overwork and not function properly. When they are not functioning correctly, they can’t control a high amount of stress and overcome it. The solution would be to support your nervous system and brain so your adrenals are able to calm your body down if it receives a sudden stress.

**Cause #2: Hypoglycemia (especially if you get a panic attack for no clear reason)**

If you are on a high-carb diet, this can cause spikes in your blood sugar levels, and as result, your body will increase Insulin (fat-storing hormone) to lower it. Eventually, this can result in your body overproducing insulin as your cells are becoming resistant to it. Insulin, in its turn, will cause severe drops of blood sugar levels.

This is called hypoglycemia (too-low blood sugar). Hypoglycemia alone has symptoms of anxiety, panic attacks, fear, etc.

One of the ways to test whether low blood sugar is causing panic attacks is this: if you consume fewer sweets and carbs and you feel calmer, then hypoglycemia is the underlying issue.

## What Are The Nutritional Benefits Of Cucumber

# What are the nutritional benefits of cucumber?

Cucumber is a keto-friendly vegetable that has high nutritional value. Cucumbers also have certain phytonutrients (healthy substances found in plants) that are also found in cruciferous vegetables.

**Benefits**

1. Can help stabilize blood sugars

2. Can help stabilize cholesterol

3. Has anti-inflammatory properties

4. Loaded with powerful antioxidants

5. Provides fiber to make butyrate (butyrate can help with insulin resistance)

**How to consume it**

You can consume it raw. If you want to get more benefit from cucumber’s phytonutrients you can ferment them (different from pickling), steam them (but don’t overcook them), and eat them with fat (for example, eat with hummus that is made with olive oils).

**Where to get it**

You can get it in a grocery store or a health food store. If you like pickles, buying fermented pickles is a better choice.

## What Are The Nutritional Benefits Of Celery

# What are the nutritional benefits of celery?

Celery is a vegetable that is very keto-friendly. There are certain phytonutrients (healthy substances found in plants) in celery that have anticancer and alkalizing properties. Let’s take a look at a list of celery’s benefits for your body.

**Benefits:**

1. Lowers uric acid

2. Can help alkalize the body

3. Can help with high blood pressure

4. Can help with insomnia

5. Can help with fluid retention

6. Can help with joint inflammation

7. Can help with UTIs (urinary tract infections)

8. Can help with gout

9. Reduces prostate enlargement

10. Lowers cortisol

1. Anti-anxiety

2. Antidiabetic

3. Anticancer

4. Anti-inflammatory

5. Decreases muscle spasms

6. Increases testosterone

7. Improves arthritis

8. Helps with balancing estrogens

**How to consume it**

Consuming the whole celery will be more beneficial than drinking it as a juice. This is because some of the phytonutrients are in the fiber part of the celery. If you are juicing the celery, you might not get enough of the phytonutrients that are in the fiber part.

Celery seed extract may also be very beneficial.

## What Are The Underlying Causes Of Premenstrual Syndrome Pms

# What are the underlying causes of premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a condition that affects your emotions, behavior and physical comfort or discomfort, just before the menstrual cycle--and sometimes during it as well.

Symptoms that you may experience prior to or during the menstrual cycle:

- Cramps

- Mood swings

- Nervousness

- Fatigue

- Depression

- Irritability

- Breast tenderness

- Sugar/carb cravings

- Headaches

- Hot flashes

- Breast aches

**Cause #1: High estrogen**

There is a connection between high estrogen (female hormone) and PMS symptoms. If your body has high amounts of estrogen from your diet or from other causes, like having a high percentage of body fat, this factor can cause many difficulties prior to the menstrual cycle as well as during it.

## What Are The Potential Reasons For Feeling The Need For An Afternoon Nap

# What are the potential reasons for feeling the need for an afternoon nap?

Need for an afternoon nap can create difficulties in your day. The important thing to know is that it is a condition which is connected to your blood sugars. Fixing your diet will remedy the need for naps during the day.

**Cause #1: Blood sugar crash**

Consuming carbs and sweets will increase blood sugar. Your body will lower the blood sugar amounts below normal levels by producing Insulin (fat-storing hormone). As a result, low blood sugar will cause sleepiness, low energy as well as will cause you to feel hungry, even though you just ate recently. This can be the cause of needing to nap during the day.

**Cause #2: Low stomach acid**

We need high stomach acidity to be able to break down and digest the load of food that we consume. If your stomach is not acidic enough, this can result in the food just sitting there in the stomach and not being digested fast enough. This can cause afternoon sleepiness.

**Cause #3: Poor quality of sleep**

If you had a bad night of sleep this can result in the need for an afternoon nap. If your sleep quality is high and you rest and recover well at night, then you will not feel sleepy during the day, provided that your blood sugar levels are normal and food is digested well.

## Can A Ketogenic Diet Provide Benefits For Individuals With Alzheimers Disease

# Can a ketogenic diet provide benefits for individuals with Alzheimer's disease?

**Alzheimer’s and ketosis:**

As well as the rest of the human body, our brain runs on fuel. Alzheimer’s disease (whether caused by genetics or brain damage) makes the brain unable to efficiently utilize sugar/carb fuel (glucose), resulting in brain starvation. However, our brains love ketones (fat-burning fuel) more than sugar/carb fuel anyway. Although the damaged brain parts of Alzheimer’s disease patients can’t utilize glucose efficiently, they can successfully utilize ketones.

## What Are The Underlying Causes Of Food Sensitivities

# What are the underlying causes of food sensitivities?

If you have an allergy or high sensitivity to certain foods this can cause indigestion, and specifically inflammation in some parts of your body-including the abdomen. If your body is not used to certain foods this can cause irritation or discomfort in the abdominal area.

**Remedies:**

**When you have abdominal discomfort, look over what you ate several hours before that. Avoid that type of food next time.**

Most common foods causing allergic reactions:

- Peanuts

- Gluten

- Dairy products

- Too much caffeine (note: withdrawal symptoms can last up to two weeks)

- Chocolate

- Tobacco

- Alcohol

- Artificial sweeteners

- Sugar alcohols

- MSG (usually in the form of modified food starch)

- Cured meats

- Aged cheeses (blue, feta, parmesan)

- Pickled, fermented foods

## What Noodles Can I Eat On Keto

# What noodles can I eat on keto?

Konjac noodles are keto-friendly. They are 97% water and 3% fiber. Fiber is a carb, but it doesn’t have any effect on insulin. Other names for konjac noodles are miracle noodles or shirataki noodles.

**This type of fiber can have some interesting effects, including:**

- It may act as a detox

- It may help support weight loss

- It may help loosen mucus

Something to keep in mind about these noodles is that they are flavorless. You’ll have to add things to them to make them flavorful. These noodles do not have the same texture as pasta noodles, but they’re similar. You may also get very thirsty if you consume them.

**Benefits of konjac noodles:**

- They can decrease hunger

- They may help stabilize your blood sugars

- They may help decrease constipation

- They don’t have any calories

**Other keto pasta alternatives:**

- Spaghetti squash

- Zucchini noodles

## Can I Eat Watermelons On Keto

# Can I eat watermelons on keto?

Yes, in small amounts.

There are two factors you need to know. One is the glycemic index, which is the speed at which your blood sugars are elevated after you eat the food item. The second is the glycemic load, which is a measurement of the quantity of carbohydrate in a given food.

A glycemic load of less than ten is on the low side. Watermelon is four, which is good. But its glycemic index is fairly high at 72. If you consume larger amounts of watermelon (or any food) the glycemic load multiplies. If you eat a small amount of watermelon on a keto diet, you’ll be okay as long as you keep within your net carbs.

If your metabolism is really slow, you want to avoid watermelon and even berries. But if your metabolism is good, you’ll be fine with a little bit of watermelon.

## Can I Consume Agave Nectar On Keto

# Can I consume agave nectar on keto?

No. Agave nectar is 90% fructose and 10% glucose. It’s not recommended.

Fructose is metabolized very differently in the body compared to glucose. Concentrated fructose puts tremendous stress on the liver because the liver is the only part of the body that can deal with fructose. Where the liver is concerned, metabolizing fructose is almost identical to consuming alcohol.

Fructose can potentially lead to:

- A fatty liver

- Insulin resistance

- Bad cholesterol (high LDL)

- High uric acid (gout)

When you consume fruit, the fiber and nutrients in the fruit help buffer the fructose. This means fruit doesn’t have near the effect that concentrated fructose (like agave nectar) has on the liver.

The main problem with fruit is that it can potentially slow down weight loss.

---

## Can I Consume Beets On Keto

# Can I consume beets on keto?

Yes. beetroot and beet tops themselves are great for the diet. Although beets contain more sugar than some vegetables, the fiber they contain binds to the sugar, which helps prevent blood sugar spikes.

You can consume beets in your salads and beet tops in your smoothies. They are fantastic for promoting a healthy body.

- Beets are amazing for boosting your liver detoxification process. They help with the enzymes that break down and eliminate toxins. If you have a fatty liver, it’s a good idea to add plenty of beets to your diet.

- Beets can support healthy testosterone levels and estrogen levels.

- Beets promote a healthy cardiovascular system by helping support healthy blood pressure levels.

## Can I Eat Quinoa On Ketogenic Diet

# Can I eat quinoa on ketogenic diet?

You cannot. Although Quinoa is very low on the glycemic index, it can still spike your blood sugars. It is gluten-free but it is processed in many factories that also process wheat - so it could be exposed to gluten. And it has a compound similar to gluten that could also create a similar inflammatory reaction on the gut.

## Can I Add Honey To The Apple Cider Vinegar Drink For Keto

# Can I add honey to the apple cider vinegar drink for keto?

No. About 56% of honey is fructose and 44% of it is glucose. Honey has a glycemic index of 78, which is high. The problem with fructose is that only the cells in the liver can deal with it. So, fructose puts a lot of stress on the liver and can create a lot of additional problems. If you had to choose between honey and sugar, honey might be the better option because it has some antioxidants and some antimicrobial properties. It may also help with certain allergies. But, overall, honey is low in actual nutrients. It may be better than refined sugar, but not by much.

## Why Can I Not Quit Chocolate

# Why can I not quit chocolate?

Chocolate contains over 380 chemicals, with three main ones creating pleasure sensations:

1\. **Phenylalanine**: Builds dopamine, enhancing mood, and producing endorphins for euphoria. Also increases noradrenaline for alertness.

2\. **Theobromine**: Similar to caffeine, it boosts mental clarity, acts as a diuretic and vasodilator. Not ideal if you have liver issues as it may disrupt sleep due to slower clearance.

3\. **Tryptophan**: Precursor to serotonin, promoting calmness, reducing stress, and lifting mood. Often consumed when feeling down.

Enjoy chocolate in moderation, preferably sugar-free with sweeteners like erythritol, stevia, or monk fruit. Avoid consuming it late in the day to prevent sleep disturbances.

---

## Does The Keto Diet Raise Cholesterol

# Does the keto diet raise cholesterol?

It may temporarily increase cholesterol.

This is an oversimplified talk and for more detailed data see Dr. Eric Berg’s video on LDL. However, as your fat cells shrink, the fat cell not only releases triglycerides, but cholesterol too. Many people do not know that fat cells are filled with both. The excess cholesterol either has to be eliminated through the liver and gallbladder (bile) or be recycled. This is all a normal process in ketosis; therefore it may increase cholesterol, but it’s a temporary effect.

As the fat cell shrinks, you can burn the triglycerides for fuel but you cannot burn the cholesterol because it is not a fuel source. It is going to be eliminated as you lose weight. As the fat cell is squeezed, the cholesterol is going to increase in the blood and is going to go into the liver and come out with the bile. As long as your liver is healthy and you’re eating a lot of vegetables, and as long as you have enough bile, you are totally fine even if your LDL is high.

The key thing is to make sure that your triglycerides are low because if you are not using your triglycerides as a fuel then there is a problem – you are probably eating too much sugar. When you are on a ketogenic diet and you are doing it correctly, and your triglycerides are low and your HDL and LDL are high, all that means is that you are burning more LDL and there are no bad effects that are going to happen. Just keep your vegetables high and as you come closer to your weight-loss goal, that will level out and come back to normal.

## Is It Possible To Lose Weight On A Ketogenic Diet Without Exercising

# Is it possible to lose weight on a ketogenic diet without exercising?

Yes. The diet contributes 85% of the progress with weight loss and exercise contributes only 15%. But then, there are benefits of exercise for your weight goal.

Benefits of exercise:

- Increases oxygen

- Lowers stress

- Increases fitness

- Tones

- Atrophy (Women going through menopause may experience atrophy in thighs and butt. Exercise helps overcome this atrophy.)

- Increases and prevents the loss of muscle mass

- Stabilizes blood sugars

- Improves sleep

- Improves stiff joints

- Increases / improves blood flow

- Strengthens heart

If you have an adrenal problem, the key is to keep the duration of exercise very short, the intensity very high, and the recovery very long. It is also important not to overtrain.

---

## Can I Consume High Fructose Syrup

# Can I consume high-fructose syrup?

**If you follow keto and an intermittent fasting plan – no.**

The problem with high-fructose corn syrup is that it is 53% glucose and 42% fructose–the rest is composed of different types of sugars. The fructose can do some serious damage to
the liver. All of your cells have receptors for glucose, but not fructose. Only your liver can break down fructose. If you consume a lot of fructose, you can overload the liver and create all sorts of health problems.

High fructose corn syrup is also made in a lab with cornstarch. Corn is GMO, so you’re getting that added glyphosate.

Thankfully, high-fructose corn syrup and even sugar are becoming less popular. This may have something to do with the awareness caused by the keto diet.

---

## How Can I Interpret Food Labels And Identify Hidden Sugars

# How can I interpret food labels and identify hidden sugars?

Many supposedly "sugar-free" items can still contain hidden sugars, disguised under names like "real cane sugar," "brown sugar," or "coconut sugar." Even terms like "organic" or "made with real fruit" can be misleading, as the products are still heavily processed and contain added sugars. "Whole grains" and "brown rice sugar" may sound healthier, but they can still impact blood sugar levels. "Natural" doesn't necessarily mean healthy either. Always check labels carefully and be aware of hidden sugars in seemingly "healthy" foods.

---

## Is It Possible To Stop Snacking

# Is it possible to stop snacking?

The snacking and grazing cycle can lead to fluctuations in blood sugar and insulin levels, potentially contributing to insulin resistance over time. Here's what to consider:

1\. Eating in response to emotions like depression, fatigue, boredom, or stress can exacerbate these feelings and perpetuate the snacking cycle.

2\. Constantly consuming carbohydrates for pleasure may lead to dopamine resistance, impacting mood regulation.

3\. Mindless eating, such as eating out of habit or availability, can keep you trapped in the snacking cycle.

4\. Fasting, when done correctly, can help break this cycle by promoting the body's use of stored fat for energy, leading to reduced hunger and cravings.

5\. Proper fasting may result in improved mood, cognitive function, and overall well-being.

6\. Strategies to break the snacking cycle include skipping breakfast, understanding the relationship between eating and hunger, avoiding junk foods, staying physically active, and minimizing carb intake during meals.

## Is Yacon Syrup Keto Friendly And Safe To Consume

# Is Yacon syrup keto-friendly and safe to consume?

It is definitely not keto-friendly! Though certain people will say that you can have it on keto and that it will help you lose weight, they are way off with this one. Yacon syrup is extracted from the roots of the yacon plant in Peru.

50% of yacon is made up of FOS, or fructooligosaccharide, which is a prebiotic fiber. If you use yacon and you have any problem with candida, SIBO, leaky gut, or any gut inflammation, you’re going to feel bloated.

30% of yacon is fructose sugar. Fructose can overwhelm the liver and lead to insulin resistance and a fatty liver. There was a study that showed that yacon could help you lose weight. However, this was based on a low-fat / low-calorie diet, which is not best for your health. Overall, yacon will spike your blood sugars enough to throw your body out of ketosis and stop fat burning. There are better sweetener alternatives, like allulose, monkfruit, swerve, stevia. Try those instead.

## Is Any Sugar Alcohol Safe To Consume On Keto

# Is any sugar alcohol safe to consume on Keto?

Some sugar alcohols are keto-friendly. Here is the chart for different sugar alcohols showing their effects on blood sugars.

Xylitol is a favorite for some people on keto because they say it doesn’t have an aftertaste. Xylitol and everything below it is going to be fine while on keto.

- Maltodextrin - 110

- Glucose - 100

- Sucrose - 65

- High-fructose corn syrup - 58

- Honey - 50

- Maltitol - 35

- Xylitol - 12

- Sorbitol - 9

- Mannitol - 2

- Erythritol - 1

- Monk fruit - 0

- Stevia - 0

Although high-fructose corn syrup has a lower glycemic number compared to maltodextrin, it can be even worse because it messes with your liver and causes insulin resistance. Avoid it at all costs!

## Is It Okay To Do Carb Cycling On Keto And Intermittent Fasting

# Is it okay to do carb cycling on keto and intermittent fasting?

Avoid carb cycling on keto and intermittent fasting. Consuming refined carbs disrupts ketosis, switching your body to sugar burning.

People often crave carbs because of low blood sugar and energy. However, incorporating carbs blocks keto, which relies on very low carb intake.

With proper adaptation, you'll transition to fat burning efficiently, maintaining high endurance and stable performance. Aim to build a strong health reserve so occasional deviations from keto have minimal impact.

## Will Vegetables Slow Down Ketosis

# Will vegetables slow down ketosis?

They will not, especially if you avoid things like corn, carrots and potatoes. If you eliminate those you don’t have to worry about the vegetable part of your diet slowing down ketosis.

Most ketogenic diets recommend 20 to 50 g of carbs per day without differentiating the types of carbohydrates. Dr Berg recommends that you get those carbs from your vegetable sources.

## What Are The Primary Risk Factors And Underlying Causes Of Breast Cancer

# What are the primary risk factors and underlying causes of breast cancer?

**Two Common Triggers of Breast Disease:**

• Excessive Amounts of Estrogen

Recommendation: High-Quality Source Sea Kelp and Cruciferous Vegetables Avoid Soy/GMO Products and Go Organic

• High Levels of Insulin – It can make the cells grow, divide and multiply

Recommendation: Do Ketogenic Diet and Intermittent Fasting Sugar and Refined Carbohydrates trigger insulin

**Mammograms**

• Mammograms can be traumatic because you are putting the breast on the plate and you are creating compression.

• Inflammatory Oncotaxis – a term that describes a condition where cells travel in the areas of inflammation in trauma. They use Ionizing Radiation, these little wave particles that go through and disrupt the electrons and certain molecules in your cells.

\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.

## Is Fasting Healthy For A Diabetic

# Is fasting healthy for a diabetic?

In the United States alone, there are about 84 million people who are pre-diabetic and 30 million who are diabetic. There is also a large number of people who have insulin resistance and are on their way to becoming a diabetic. 

**There are two main mechanisms with diabetes medications:**

1\. Targeting insulin resistance 

2\. Increasing insulin

The medications that increase insulin also increase the risk of cardiovascular mortality by 59-68%.  What you need to realize is that high insulin is just as damaging as high blood glucose. You need normal insulin, but you don’t need tremendous amounts of insulin. If you combine therapeutic fasting, where you’re making sure you’re getting all of your nutrients, with a low-carb diet—this can produce amazing results. 

**A few benefits of fasting for diabetics might be:**

1\. Within 4 months—no need for insulin 

2\. A decrease in A1C

3\. A decrease in waist size 

4\. Able to control blood sugars

## Who Shouldnt Do Intermittent Fasting

# Who shouldn't do intermittent fasting?

Certain individuals should avoid intermittent fasting due to specific health conditions. Pregnant women should maintain a nutrient-dense diet with three meals a day without restricting calories. Nursing mothers must ensure they receive all necessary nutrients to avoid deprivation. Individuals with neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, should consume three meals daily with a low carbohydrate intake. Babies and small children should avoid sweets and maintain regular meals.

Those with eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia should also refrain from intermittent fasting. For people with hypoglycemia, intermittent fasting can be beneficial if introduced gradually with nutrient-dense foods to stabilize blood sugar levels. Anxiety can decrease with intermittent fasting as it supports adrenal gland function, and it can also improve sleep disorders by enhancing brain health and reducing the need for sleep. Women with hormonal issues, including PCOS, may benefit from intermittent fasting due to its positive effects on hormone regulation.

## Is Intermittent Fasting Safe For Your Adrenals

# Is intermittent fasting safe for your adrenals?

It's normal for the adrenals to raise cortisol levels during intermittent fasting to counter a low blood sugar level. While many people suffering from adrenal fatigue hear this about fasting and believe it is safer to avoid it, actually the opposite is true. Fasting can be beneficial for the adrenals because it relieves oxidative stress and inflammation, which considerably alleviates stress on the adrenals.

## Are There Any Negative Aspects Of Intermittent Fasting

# Are there any negative aspects of intermittent fasting?

Intermittent fasting is very beneficial for people who are able to successfully implement it. It can lead to weight less, cell regeneration, less unhealthy cravings, better blood sugar control and much more.

While most people will gain great benefits from adopting intermittent fasting, women that are pregnant or breastfeeding should not adopt this eating pattern, as they require a higher level of nutrient intake. In addition, those with a history of eating disorders should not try intermittent fasting as it could trigger harmful tendencies. Aside from these groups, intermittent fasting is a transformative way of eating that can improve anyone's health and well-being.

## Should I Skip Breakfast When Im Fasting

# Should I skip breakfast when I'm fasting?

Skipping breakfast can be an excellent way to adjust your body to intermittent fasting and has many benefits. Because eating breakfast every morning can slow your metabolism, those looking to boost theirs may want to skip the first meal of the day.

Eating first thing in the morning also spikes your insulin, which halts the many benefits your body reaps overnight as you don't eat. And third, skipping breakfast can be beneficial because most typical breakfast foods are high in sugar and will cause your blood sugar to crash early in the day.

## What Are The Most Important Benefits Of Dark Chocolate

# What are the most important benefits of dark chocolate?

Cacao is the raw bean that’s fermented and processed into chocolate. Cacao and dark chocolate are both loaded with phytonutrients (polyphenols and flavonols). They actually have higher amounts than blueberries or açaí berries. There is a small amount of caffeine in cacao and dark chocolate, as well as a good amount of theobromine (a stimulant). So, if you have cacao or dark chocolate later in the day or before bed, it may keep you up.

I consume a little bit of chocolate on a regular basis, but I always consume chocolate that is organic and doesn’t contain sugar. A few brands I like are Lily’s Sweets and Choc Zero. Cacao and dark chocolate are high in oxalates. So, if you’re at risk for kidney stones, you may not want to consume either one.

## How Much Is Too Much Fat On Keto

# How much is too much fat on Keto?

This is a balance of enough versus too much and getting your sweet spot (no pun intended).

If you have hypoglycemia (low blood sugars) you will need a bit more to go from one meal to the next. However, you also need to make sure you do not have too much, thus overloading the gallbladder and causing (bloating, right shoulder pain, etc). Also, if you consume too much fat, esp. between meals or after meals, you will end up burning dietary fat and NOT your own fat despite being in ketosis.

This is why I recommend always doing intermittent fasting with ketosis. So in other words - you'll have to adjust your fats until it's just right - no gallbladder issues, but allowing you to go from one meal to the next. If you are new to this, you may want to get my booklet or even my bigger book either on the website - drberg.com or amazon. On my website - you can get both as a discount, but not on amazon.

## Is Snacking Good For Low Blood Sugars

# Is snacking good for low blood sugars?

Snacking makes low blood sugar worse over time. Every time you eat a snack insulin is triggered, causing your blood sugars to drop again, which makes you want another snack. Snacks will not help improve low blood sugar meaningfully. Instead, try adopting a Healthy Keto® diet, as this will aid your body in regulating blood sugar levels properly.

## Is It Possible To Regulate Blood Sugar Levels Without Consuming Sugar

# Is it possible to regulate blood sugar levels without consuming sugar?

When you are eating sugars and carbs often, your body and brain use glucose as it's main form of energy. But the body can also convert foods into ketones, which serve as an excellent source of energy for both the brain and body. If you want to control your blood sugar levels without eating sugar, try switching to a low-carb diet like Healthy Keto® as this will reduce insulin spikes while also ensuring you have plenty of energy.

## What Are Some Less Obvious Factors That Can Contribute To High Blood Pressure

# What are some less obvious factors that can contribute to high blood pressure?

9 reasons your blood sugar may be high:

1\. Cortisol: A morning cortisol spike can raise blood sugar.

2\. Low Blood Sugar: Hormonal overcompensation for low blood sugar can lead to high blood sugar.

3\. Late-Night Snacks: Carb-rich snacks can increase blood sugar.

4\. Previous Day's Sugar: Sugar consumed the day before can affect blood sugar the next day.

5\. Low Blood Pressure: Medications for low blood pressure can raise blood glucose.

6\. Stress: Stress and anxiety can elevate cortisol and blood sugar.

7\. Missed Meds: Forgetting medications can disrupt blood sugar levels.

8\. Nighttime Exercise: Exercising late may cause your body to overcompensate.

9\. Additives: MSG and artificial sweeteners can spike blood sugar. Addressing insulin resistance with healthy keto and intermittent fasting may help.

## Is Apple Cider Vinegar Effective Against Blood Sugar Problems

# Is apple cider vinegar effective against blood sugar problems?

If you have blood sugar issues, adding apple cider vinegar (ACV) to your diet can be highly beneficial. The acetic acid in ACV provides a potent anti-glycemic effect, helping to lower the glycemic index of the foods you eat. This can stabilize blood sugar and insulin levels, leading to reduced insulin production. Lower insulin levels can help decrease liver fat, promote weight loss, and reduce hunger and cravings.

## What Factors Contribute To Elevated Blood Sugar Levels In The Morning

# What factors contribute to elevated blood sugar levels in the morning?

This condition, known as the dawn phenomenon, can affect those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or severe insulin resistance. Elevated morning blood sugar can be caused by:

1\. Cortisol spike: Peaks between 6 and 9 am, increasing glucose production.

2\. Type 1 diabetes: Growth hormone spikes can raise blood sugar.

3\. Type 2 diabetes: The liver produces glucose, and hormones like glucagon and epinephrine may elevate blood sugar.

4\. Evening carbs: Consuming high-carb meals the night before.

To manage high morning blood sugar, try adhering to a healthy ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. Exercising, avoiding carbs at night, and drinking diluted apple cider vinegar before bed can all help as well.

## What Are Some Keto Friendly Foods

# What are some Keto-friendly foods?

Dr. Berg talks about Acceptable Pleasure Foods on the ketogenic diet. These foods are not meant to be consumed as a snack but after the meal as a dessert. These recipes are low carb, however, the bread recipe contains a bit more carb due to a tiny bit of molasses and arrowroot flour, however, it's still a lot smaller than typical bread due to no wheat flour. Also, test the waters with these recipes because some people are sensitive to sugar alcohol and can experience some bloating. Then some people consume excess amounts of these treats and because of the delicious recipes, they eat WAY TOO MUCH- so be careful.

A few symptoms of Candida are achiness of joints, fatigue, itchiness of the body, and digestive issues just to name a few. You want to stay away from sugar, birth control pills can accelerate it as well as stress.

Doing intermittent fasting for at least 18 hours or more will put your body in an autophagy state in which the body would eliminate yeast, mold, fungus, and candida. Adding Thyme oil, grapefruit, and seed extract can help with the healing process.

- Tapioca

- Fructose

- Coconut sugar

- Agave nectar

- Honey

## Is Tapioca Starch Ok To Consume On Keto

# Is tapioca starch ok to consume on Keto?

No. Tapioca is a starch that comes from the cassava plant. It’s actually quite high in carbohydrates. In fact, the carbohydrate content of cassava flour is 25% more than that of white flour.

If we compare tapioca flour to almond flour, this is what we find:

- 1/4 cup tapioca flour – 27 net carbs

- 1/4 cup almond flour – 3 net carbs

There is an ingredient found in many so-called “keto-friendly” products called soluble tapioca fiber. Soluble tapioca fiber is the same thing as “prebiotic tapioca” and “organic non-GMO tapioca fiber.”

Soluble tapioca fiber is a big source of IMO, which is a common sweetener. Dr. Berg no longer recommends it. Recent studies show that IMO has the same glycemic effect as glucose and dextrose. It’s actually worse to use than sugar. If you want to eat keto-friendly foods and stay in ketosis, you may want to stay away from tapioca flour and tapioca fiber.

## Are Frequent And Small Meals An Effective Strategy For Weight Loss

# Are frequent and small meals an effective strategy for weight loss?

One of the big tips for sticking to diets and losing weight is to eat frequent small meals. But, every time you eat, you increase insulin.  In the presence of insulin, you can’t burn fat, and if you can’t burn fat, then you can’t lose weight. This can also cause insulin resistance, which can lead to a myriad of health concerns.  Eating less frequently, also known as intermittent fasting, is one of the best things you can do to lose weight and support your overall health.  To stay satisfied between meals without eating snacks, you need to feed the cells your body fat (burn fat). But, to burn fat, you have to lower your insulin by lowering your carbohydrates and eating less frequently.  Once your body has adapted to burning fat, not only will you be able to lose weight, you will finally get rid of hunger and cravings for good.

## Will Avocados Help Me Lose Weight

# Will avocados help me lose weight?

Avocados are high in calories, but there is no need to worry that you will gain weight. In fact, avocados contain avocatin B, a fat molecule that helps to shrink belly fat by stimulating your metabolism to burn fats.

## Can I Have Beets On Keto

# Can I have beets on Keto?

Yes, beets are keto-friendly. Beets are low in net carbs, high in dietary fiber, and a highly nutritious vegetable that you can regularly incorporate into your keto menu plan.

While beets are an excellent keto-approved food, it’s best to avoid drinking beetroot juice. Beet juice is high in carbs, contains no dietary fiber, and can quickly push you out of ketosis.

## How Many Carbs Are In Alcohol

# How many carbs are in alcohol?

How many carbs are in alcohol depends on the type and whether it’s mixed with other beverages. Beer tends to contain around 15 grams per five-ounce serving, wine typically has between two to four grams per four-ounce serving, and hard liquor mixed with a soft drink can contain as much as 25 grams for an eight-ounce serving. Mixed drinks can contain even more sugar per serving, depending on the ingredients. Because of their high net carbs, alcoholic drinks are not safe on keto diets.

## Which Is Better Erythritol Or Allulose

# Which is better, erythritol or allulose?

Whether erythritol or allulose is better depends on the desired use. Erythritol has a stronger taste and cooling effect that can quickly overpower a sugary recipe. However, it’s a great sweetener for tea and coffee. Allulose is generally recommended for baking as it melts and caramelizes similarly to sugar and can be used at a one-to-one ratio in most recipes.

### **Easily Digestible Vegetables for Keto Dieters**

Some of the best vegetables to consume during ketosis include green lettuce, cucumber, tomato, zucchini, bell pepper, and bean sprouts. These options are lower in fiber and more accessible for your gut microbiome to handle.

You can also try cooking your vegetables instead of eating them raw, as this can make them easier to digest. Steaming, sautéing, or roasting are all excellent options.

Focusing on these easily digestible vegetables can help prevent diarrhea and other digestive disturbances while still providing the nutrients your body needs to thrive on a keto diet.

## What Are Some Effective Strategies For Managing Sugar Intake In Children

# What are some effective strategies for managing sugar intake in children?

As parents, it's our responsibility to help children develop healthy eating habits, particularly in managing sugar intake. By implementing informed strategies, we can support their physical and emotional well-being.

**Understanding Labels:**

\- **Hidden Sugars:** Learn to identify added sugars on labels, such as high fructose corn syrup, glucose, and dextrose. Even "natural" sugars like honey and maple syrup contribute to overall sugar intake and should be consumed in moderation.

\- **Vigilance:** Familiarize yourself with the various names for sugar to make informed food choices for your family.

**Healthy Alternatives:**

\- **Whole Foods:** Replace sugary snacks with naturally sweet and nutritious options like fresh fruits (berries, apples) and vegetables (carrots, bell peppers) paired with hummus or nut butter.

\- **Beverage Choices:** Encourage water, unsweetened herbal teas, or low-fat milk over sugary drinks. For flavored drinks, try infusing water with fresh fruit slices or mint for a refreshing, natural sweetness.

By making these mindful changes, you can help your child maintain a balanced diet and develop healthy lifelong habits.

## How Can I Tell If Something Is Healthy On Keto

# How can I tell if something is healthy on Keto?

Not all foods marketed as "keto" are truly healthy. Despite being under 50 grams of net carbs, some contain resistant starches like tapioca and maltodextrin, classified as fiber but impacting insulin differently. These starches are often derived from corn starch and can be misleading on labels.

To ensure you're making healthy choices, read ingredient labels carefully and look for hidden starches and sugars. Stay informed by following reliable sources for up-to-date information on keto-friendly foods.

## If I Cant Access Grass Fed Meat Will Other Kinds Of Meat Still Be Beneficial

# If I can’t access grass-fed meat, will other kinds of meat still be beneficial?

I think if you can't find it something is better than nothing. And I would definitely get off the fiber and all the other stuff. Just do the meat, eggs, fish, organ meats.

## What Are The Only Two Foods That Dont Trigger Insulin

# What are the only two foods that don’t trigger insulin?

Fat and fiber. Now I'm not talking about the fiber in whole grains or added synthetic fibers. I'm talking about fiber from vegetable and then fat as a pure fat.

**What food combinations would be a good combination to consume both fiber and fat if you're trying to keep your insulin low?** Well, what about a salad with olive oil? That would be a good one. Or maybe celery with peanut butter. Or even more tasty yet, some raw cream whipped into whipped cream and then some blueberries which has some fiber in it. These are just things that you can add to your diet either as a food or dessert. That will definitely help you keep that insulin lowered in addition to other benefits.

## Can Pregnant Women Drink Kombucha

# Can pregnant women drink kombucha?

Yes, but unfortunately kombucha comes with a lot of carbs sometimes, and you don't want to drink too much, because it's very acidic. A little bit would be fine. It helps your digestion but be careful because it's a bit higher in sugar than you might think.

---

## Is Coconut Sugar A Good Alternative Sugar

# Is coconut sugar a good alternative sugar?

Coconut sugar is not a good alternative. The worst sugar is agave nectar. But coconut sugar has just too much sugar. So you're going to have to do something like xylitol or erythritol as your sugar alternative, or stevia or monk fruit, because these other sugars just are going to blow your sugars out.

## Why Am I So Hungry On Keto

# Why am I so hungry on Keto?

Increased hunger may indicate that your body has not yet fully adapted to ketosis. It’s important to assess your carbohydrate intake, as it may be too high, which can hinder your ability to enter fat-burning mode. Additionally, incorporating intermittent fasting could be beneficial, as it helps facilitate the transition to ketosis.

During the initial adaptation phase, some hunger is normal; however, as your body becomes more efficient at burning fat for energy, you should experience a reduction in hunger. This decrease in appetite is a key indicator that the ketogenic diet is effectively working for you. If your hunger persists, consider consulting a healthcare professional for further guidance.

## Is It Appropriate For Children To Follow A Ketogenic Diet

# Is it appropriate for children to follow a ketogenic diet?

While a strict ketogenic diet may not be appropriate for children, adopting a low-carbohydrate approach can be beneficial. Children may tolerate a higher intake of certain carbohydrates, such as fruits and occasional sweet potatoes, while avoiding typical sugary foods. It is advisable to eliminate processed cereals and grains from their diet.

I recommend focusing on three substantial meals each day rather than frequent snacking, as constant snacking can lead to repeated spikes in insulin levels. Children have a naturally high metabolism, and if they are physically active, they can effectively utilize some of the carbohydrates from fruits and other sources. As always, consulting with a healthcare professional or nutritionist is recommended to ensure that any dietary changes are appropriate for a child’s specific needs.

## How Can I Convince My Kids To Do Healthy Keto

# How can I convince my kids to do Healthy Keto®?

It's challenging to break habits formed by exposure to sweets and sugars. One approach is to educate children continuously about healthy choices until it becomes ingrained.

## What Natural Remedies Can Help Manage Mrsa Alongside Conventional Treatments

# What natural remedies can help manage MRSA alongside conventional treatments?

To address MRSA naturally, consider the following strategies:

1\. **Powerful Probiotics**: Use high-potency probiotics to enhance gut flora and outcompete pathogenic microbes.

2\. **Fermented Foods**: Incorporate fermented foods such as sauerkraut, kimchi, and kefir to support beneficial bacteria.

3\. **Avoid Sugars**: Reduce sugar intake to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria.

## Do I Need To Stop Eating Fruit

# Do I need to stop eating fruit?

You don't need to eliminate fruit entirely on a keto diet. Berries are a suitable option as they are lower in sugar compared to other fruits.

Some individuals, particularly those following a carnivore keto approach, incorporate fruit and honey due to their improved metabolic flexibility and lack of insulin resistance. However, this is not suitable for everyone. Many people may struggle to metabolize higher-sugar fruits, leading to potential complications.

For most individuals, it is advisable to limit fruit intake to maintain ketosis and avoid metabolic issues, unless they are highly active and can effectively burn off the extra sugars.

## What Are The Quickest Methods To Relieve Bloating Immediately

# What are the quickest methods to relieve bloating immediately?

You can try consuming fewer foods to help isolate what’s causing you to bloat the most. It’s important to consider what you ate just before you noticed you were bloated. This will give you a big clue as to what’s causing you to bloat.

One of the best things to do for bloating is intermittent fasting. The more frequently you eat, the more bloating problems you’ll have. Gas produced by microbes in your gut can also cause bloating. When trying to get rid of bloating, avoiding certain things is way more important than taking certain things.

**Common foods to avoid to help with bloating:**

• Fruit

• Beans

• Grains

• Refined sugars

• Sugar alcohols

• Starches

• Maltodextrin or dextrin

• Functional fibers

• Prebiotics

• Gluten

• Lactose

• Casein

• Nuts or nut butter

• Vegetables

**Other potential causes of bloating:**

• Stress

• Constipation

• Menstrual cramps

## Whats The Best Nut For Keto

# What's the best nut for Keto?

Today we’re going to cover the best types of nuts to have on a healthy keto diet. To find out what the best keto nuts are, I took the total carbs and subtracted the fiber to get the net carbs. I also put the fat grams next to the net carbs, because ideally, on the keto diet, you want more fat and low net carbs.

**Best and worst nuts for keto (1 cup):**

• Pecans: Total carbs (14g) - Fiber (10g) = Net carbs (4g) Fat = (71)

• Brazil nuts: Total carbs (16g) - Fiber (10g) = Net carbs (6g) Fat = (88)

• Walnuts: Total carbs (11g) - Fiber (5g) = Net carbs (6g) Fat = (52)

• Macadamia nuts: Total carbs (19g) - Fiber (12g) = Net carbs (7g) Fat = (102)

• Almonds: Total carbs (20g) - Fiber (11g) = Net carbs (9g) Fat = (45)

• Pine nuts: Total carbs (18g) - Fiber (5g) = Net carbs 13g) Fat = (92)

• Almond butter: Total carbs (47g) - Fiber (26g) = Net carbs (21g) Fat = (139)

• Pistachio: Total carbs (38g) - Fiber (13g) = Net carbs (21g) Fat = (56)

• Peanut butter: Total carbs (50g) - Fiber (15g) = Net carbs (35g) Fat = (130)

• Cashews: Total carbs (39g) - Fiber (4g) = Net carbs (35g) Fat = (62)

## Does Fasting Turn Into Starving

# Does fasting turn into starving?

You first need to know that the average non-overweight person is carrying around 100,000 calories of fat on their body. They are only carrying about 1,700 calories of stored sugar.

**If you weighed 150 lbs, you would burn around 1,000-2,000 calories per day. This means that you have around 67 days worth of calories stored on your body. The difference between fasting and starving is that with fasting, you’re living off of your fat fuel. When you’re starving, you’ve already used up all of your fat fuel, and you begin burning your muscle and organs for fuel.**

If you have 100-200 lbs of extra fat, you have many calories stored. The effects of fasting and starving are different. When you’re fasting, you don’t feel hungry—when you’re starving, you do. When you’re starving, you also feel irritable, apathetic, fatigued, and weak. You also develop nutrient deficiencies when you’re starving. Fasting helps you feel energetic, focus, and calm. Intermittent fasting alone will not cause starvation. While you’re fasting, make sure you take nutrients, so you don’t develop a deficiency.
