## What Are The Most Effective Methods Or Treatments For Dissolving Kidne 9Bbd36

# What are the most effective methods or treatments for dissolving kidney stones, and how do they work to aid in their dissolution and removal?

The most common type of kidney stone is a calcium oxalate stone. In this situation, you have high oxalates and calcium and low citrate.

You may have high oxalates from consuming too many high-oxalate foods. Oxalates are in a lot of foods, including keto-friendly foods. High calcium in the urine can be due to a genetic mutation. Your body makes citrates, which bind with calcium to lessen the amount of free calcium in the body. Free calcium is what can bind to oxalates.

Drinking more fluids during the day is one of the best ways to prevent kidney stones. I suggest drinking at least two and a half liters of fluids per day if you're prone to getting kidney stones. Another great way to prevent kidney stones is to add electrolyte powder containing potassium citrate or magnesium citrate to your water.

## Is It Advisable To Follow A Ketogenic Diet With Hypoglycemia

# Is it advisable to follow a ketogenic diet with hypoglycemia?

Low blood sugar comes from high blood sugar and the spike of insulin pushing it down – hypoglycemia is high insulin.

**Don’t we need sugar to balance it?**

• The actual cause of hypoglycemia is high insulin so adding more sugar to balance, it raises more insulin. Insulin resistance is also caused by too much insulin. When you have insulin resistance, the body is making 7x the amount of insulin that you need compared to a normal person.

**How to keep insulin normal?**

• Keep sugars low.

• Don’t do frequent meals.

• Consume Magnesium + Potassium + Vitamin B1 (nutritional yeast)

## Can I Eat Peanut Butter On Keto

# Can I eat peanut butter on keto?

Yes. The peanut butter or nut butter should be organic and shouldn’t have any added sugar. There also shouldn’t be any oils in the peanut butter other than peanut oil. Consume in small amounts and don’t overdo it.

Also, peanuts are high in oxalates and those can cause kidney stones. You can add some calcium or cheese with the meal (not separately) to make the oxalates bind in the digestive tract instead of going to the kidney.

## Is Any Sugar Alcohol Safe To Consume On Keto

# Is any sugar alcohol safe to consume on Keto?

Some sugar alcohols are keto-friendly. Here is the chart for different sugar alcohols showing their effects on blood sugars.

Xylitol is a favorite for some people on keto because they say it doesn’t have an aftertaste. Xylitol and everything below it is going to be fine while on keto.

- Maltodextrin - 110

- Glucose - 100

- Sucrose - 65

- High-fructose corn syrup - 58

- Honey - 50

- Maltitol - 35

- Xylitol - 12

- Sorbitol - 9

- Mannitol - 2

- Erythritol - 1

- Monk fruit - 0

- Stevia - 0

Although high-fructose corn syrup has a lower glycemic number compared to maltodextrin, it can be even worse because it messes with your liver and causes insulin resistance. Avoid it at all costs!

## Is Allulose A Good Alternative Sweetener

Allulose is an excellent sweetener, as it has a zero glycemic index and is not classified as a sugar alcohol. Erythritol is another good option, while xylitol, though effective, is not glycemic-index-free. Avoid sweeteners like maltitol, maltose, mannitol, sorbitol, Splenda, and synthetic sugars like maltodextrin, which is commonly found in keto-friendly products but may not be ideal.

## Why Is It Important To Read Labels On The Food Products

# Why is it important to read labels on the food products?

One of my staff members purchased peanut butter and asked if it was ok to eat.

It turned out that the product was cookie butter and didn’t even include any peanuts in the ingredients! Upon reading the nutrition facts, I discovered that each 2-tablespoon serving of this cookie butter contained 11 grams of sugar. With 13 servings per container, the cookie butter contained more than 100 grams of sugar!

The first ingredient was wheat flour, followed by sugar and vegetable oil. The main vegetable oil used was soy oil which is GMO and highly inflammatory. Most of the ingredients in this “peanut butter” were highly addictive and highly inflammatory. Always read food labels in their entirety to avoid consuming harmful ingredients.

## How Do I Know If An Avocado Is Ready To Eat

Ripe avocados have dark, almost black skin with a bumpy texture. They are firm but do yield somewhat if pressure is applied. 

A firm avocado with green, smooth skin is likely underripe and needs a few more days to ripen. If an avocado is black, dented, and squishy, it’s overripe and likely will have an unpleasant texture and bitter taste.

## Keto Broccoli Fritters Recipe

# Keto Broccoli Fritters Recipe

These green broccoli fritters are really yummy. I recommend you serve them warm, with some sour cream or plain yogurt. The texture is great, and the flavor is subtle. Give them a try!  Here's how to make keto-friendly broccoli fritters at home:

**Ingredients:**

• 1 Cup steamed broccoli

• 2 Eggs

• 1/2 tsp curry powder

• ¼ tsp sea salt and pepper to taste

• Coconut oil 

• (may need a little coconut flour)

**Directions:**

• In a food processor, pulse the broccoli until finely ground. Pulse eggs, curry powder, salt, and pepper. The batter should be thick enough to hold a pancake shape in the pan. If it's too watery, add coconut flour (1 tsp) and blend again. Blend until thick and smooth. 

• Heat skillet to medium-high. I love cast iron. Always fully heat the cast iron first and add oil. Drop about 2 tbsp. of "batter" into the hot pan for each fritter. Brown on one side before turning. You can peek under to see if it's ready. Flip and brown the other side.

Enjoy!

## Keto Quiche Recipe

# Keto Quiche Recipe

If you’re in a rush or maybe you even hate to cook, this quick and simple recipe is for you. You can make this keto-friendly quiche recipe in advance to enjoy later. You can also make the pie crust and egg mixture separately and freeze them both to have on hand.  You can double or triple this recipe to make a variety of quiches to freeze and have at any time of the day. What Karen Berg did, was made a large batch of the egg mixture, poured it into six different pie crusts, and then filled them with different things.

**The different keto-friendly quiches Karen Berg made are:**

• Chicken and sharp cheddar 

• Veggie 

• Bacon, onion, and cheddar 

• Ham and swiss

• Spinach and salmon 

• Cheese and sausage 

The crust for this quiche is not wheat. It’s made with almond flour. These crusts are also super fast and easy to make. 

**The secret if you want a quiche with different things in it: Cook the meat and saute the vegetables ahead of time, add those ingredients to the crust first, then pour the egg on top of that.** 

**Here’s how to make quiche at home:**

1\. Mix together 3 eggs, 1 cup of organic milk, 1/2 cup organic cream, and 1 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper, 1/2 tsp. chives

## I Ate When I Was Not Hungry While On Keto And Intermittent Fasting Is It Bad

# I ate when I was not hungry while on Keto and Intermittent fasting, is it bad?

Our body is not designed to eat at the frequency that people eat. You have social events, social events, birthdays, vacations, holidays, going out to dinner, etc.

**One of the best habits you can implement is:**

1\. Only eat when you are hungry

2\. Don't eat unless you are hungry.

If you are doing intermittent fasting and not hungry anymore, then do a gradient approach. The main point is keeping your nutrients high, but just eating less frequently. Eating spikes insulin.
