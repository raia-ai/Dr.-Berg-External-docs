## Interesting Facts About Sugar

# Interesting Facts About Sugar

1\. It’s not just the amount of carbohydrates that matters. It’s also the quality of the carbs. You have to consume less than 50 grams of net carbs per day to get into ketosis. But, there is a big difference between consuming 50 grams of sugar carbs vs. 50 grams of carbs in general. For example, 50 grams of carbohydrates from sugar would be equivalent to a twelve-ounce orange soda. But 50 grams of net carbs from vegetables is equivalent to about 42 cups of salad.

2\. The liver treats fructose like alcohol. Most types of sugar are really fifty percent glucose and fifty percent fructose. When you check your blood sugar, you’re really only looking at the glucose. Fructose doesn’t affect the blood sugar by that much. Instead, it affects the liver. Even though fructose doesn’t raise your blood sugar levels, it can create other serious issues. These issues can include a fatty liver, high triglycerides, high cholesterol, free radical damage, inflammation, insulin resistance, and diabetes.

3\. Just because it’s from beets doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Most of the sugar used in the US is from beets and is genetically modified, so there are traces of glyphosate. There is an in-depth process to produce beet sugar, and the end product is refined and overly processed.

4\. The chemistry of glucose is similar to vitamin C. This means that glucose and vitamin C are competitive to a certain degree. If you consume sugar, your body won’t absorb vitamin C.

## Can Healthy Keto Help With Psoriasis

# Can Healthy Keto help with psoriasis?

Yes, the Healthy Keto® diet can help with psoriasis. Here are some key points from Dr. Berg's recommendations:

\- **Anti-Inflammatory Foods**: Incorporating anti-inflammatory foods such as berries, vegetables, fatty fish, and nuts into your diet can help reduce inflammation, which may alleviate symptoms of psoriasis.

\- **Healthy Fats**: Consuming healthy fats like avocados, nuts, and fatty fish provides essential fatty acids for maintaining healthy skin. These fatty acids help moisturize your skin, reduce inflammation, and protect against sun damage.

\- **Vitamin D and Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Supplementing with vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, found in cod liver oil, can help manage psoriasis symptoms. Vitamin D helps regulate T-cells, and omega-3s are potent anti-inflammatories that can reduce dry, scaly, and red skin.

\- **Bile Salts**: Bile salts stimulate vitamin D receptors, allowing vitamin D to work more effectively in the body, which can benefit psoriasis.

\- **Intermittent Fasting**: Combining intermittent fasting with a ketogenic diet can significantly lower insulin levels and improve skin conditions. Limiting your eating window each day gives your body a chance to rest and repair, which can benefit skin health.

By taking charge of your diet and incorporating these elements, you can actively manage symptoms of psoriasis and improve overall skin health. Remember, always consult with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for your individual needs.

## As Someone With Elevated Cholesterol Is Keto Even Possible While I Eat 31Fee6

# As someone with elevated cholesterol, is keto even possible while I eat only fish?

Absolutely because here's some data that you may not know. Cholesterol many times especially the kind that can invade your arteries is converted from carbs. So if you're doing the fatty fish hence you're going to be fine. Then do the rest vegetables, not the grains, not the sugar because the fatty liver can be coming from nonfat sources. It could be coming from vegan carbohydrates. And so they found that if you do a low carb diet the fat on your liver potentially can reduce to 50% in two weeks.

I would combine the healthy keto with the fish and do an intermittent fasting together. That'll be your best bet. I'd probably add into the mix the milk thistle because that's one of the best remedies for supporting liver and improving liver enzymes. The cruciferous vegetables are great for the liver.

**\*Please keep in mind that the above is not a medical advice. You should see your doctor about any possible medical conditions.**

## Why Am I So Hungry On Keto

# Why am I so hungry on Keto?

Increased hunger may indicate that your body has not yet fully adapted to ketosis. It’s important to assess your carbohydrate intake, as it may be too high, which can hinder your ability to enter fat-burning mode. Additionally, incorporating intermittent fasting could be beneficial, as it helps facilitate the transition to ketosis.

During the initial adaptation phase, some hunger is normal; however, as your body becomes more efficient at burning fat for energy, you should experience a reduction in hunger. This decrease in appetite is a key indicator that the ketogenic diet is effectively working for you. If your hunger persists, consider consulting a healthcare professional for further guidance.

## What Are The Criticisms Of The Ketogenic Diet

# What are the criticisms of the Ketogenic Diet?

Some common criticisms of the ketogenic diet include concerns about nutrient deficiencies due to limited food variety.

That’s why it’s crucial to do Healthy Keto® focusing on whole foods such as grass-fed beef, organ meat, organic vegetables and high-fat dairy, wild caught-game meat and fish, seafood, and seeds and nuts. Learn more about these concerns and their counterarguments in this [article](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-9-low-carb-myths-debunked).

## High Carb Vs. Healthy Ketogenic Diet

# High-Carb Vs. Healthy Ketogenic Diet

## **High-Carb Vs. Healthy Ketogenic Diets**

A diet abundant in refined carbs can lead to a heightened need for vitamins B1 and C. This is because refining strips away much of their nutritional value, leaving you with empty calories that do little to nourish your body.

### **Why Does Consuming Refined Carbs Increase Our Need For Vitamins?**

The more processed carbohydrates you take in, the harder your body has to work to break them down. This increased metabolic activity requires additional nutrients for support - hence the heightened need for vitamins such as B1 (thiamine) and C (ascorbic acid).

Thiamine is crucial in converting food into energy, while ascorbic acid helps protect cells from damage.

### **Transitioning From Carb-heavy Meals To Balanced Ketogenic Plates**

A healthy ketogenic lifestyle is a diet focused on low-carb, high-fat foods that promote balanced nutrition without overloading your system with unnecessary sugars.

By reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with healthy fats, the keto diet puts your body into a metabolic state known as ketosis, where fat becomes its primary fuel source instead of glucose derived from carbohydrates.

This helps maintain steady blood sugar levels and reduces insulin resistance, promoting better nutrient absorption. To make transitioning easier, gradually reduce your carb intake while increasing healthy fats.

[Incorporate healthy fats into your diet](https://www.drberg.com/ketosis-approved-foods), such as avocados, nuts/seeds, and fatty fish, and include plenty of green leafy vegetables.

## **Conclusion**

Healthy Keto is excellent for weight loss and promotes overall health. A high-fat diet can lower the risk of insulin resistance, help balance hormonal levels, and promote digestive health.

## What Do I Do If I Have Hormonal Imbalances On Keto

# What do I do if I have hormonal imbalances on Keto?

## **Hormonal Imbalances & Calcium Absorption**

Our bodies are complex systems, with various factors influencing nutrient absorption. Hormonal balance is one such factor. [Hormonal imbalances](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-hormonal-imbalance-really-occurs) can affect the absorption of minerals like calcium, which is crucial for bone health and nerve impulses.

During menopause, hormone levels can vary significantly - particularly a decrease in estrogen - which may lead to decreased mineral uptake, such as calcium.

Postmenopausal women tend to have lower bone density due to reduced calcium absorption, making them more susceptible to osteoporosis.

### **Balancing Hormones For Improved Mineral Absorption**

The good news? Adopting a healthy ketogenic lifestyle may help. The Healthy Keto Diet focuses on consuming nutrient-dense foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals for optimal body function.

- Foods high in healthy fats (like avocados) support hormone production by providing the necessary building blocks for hormones.

- Maintaining stable blood sugar levels through low-carb intake helps prevent insulin spikes, which could disrupt other hormone balances.

- Plenty of leafy greens provide an excellent source of calcium without the risk associated with dairy consumption.

## Why Do People Have A Resistance To Keto

# Why do people have a resistance to Keto?

## **Understanding Resistance to Keto**

Exploring why some resist the ketogenic lifestyle—due to misconceptions, social influences, and ingrained habits—can help individuals overcome these barriers and unlock keto’s benefits.

**Perception of Health Without Problems**

Many people mistakenly believe they’re in perfect health, overlooking the need for dietary changes. This mindset can hinder acceptance of the keto diet. Even though keto offers health and weight loss benefits, convincing those who feel healthy can be challenging, especially when symptoms aren't apparent. Sharing success stories and research about keto’s preventive benefits can help change this perception.

**The Challenge of Invisible Health Issues**

Invisible health problems often go unnoticed until they become serious. Conditions like prediabetes or insulin resistance may not present obvious symptoms. By gently guiding friends and family to recognize these hidden risks, we can show how keto can combat inflammation and stabilize blood sugar.

**Identifying the Real Issue**

Understanding the core issue is crucial for finding effective solutions. Whether in relationships, work, or health, identifying underlying factors allows for targeted interventions and proactive steps.

**Beyond Weight Loss**

When discussing keto, it’s essential to look beyond just weight loss. Hesitations may arise from unseen struggles like chronic fatigue or medical conditions. By uncovering these issues, we can foster meaningful conversations about keto’s broader benefits, focusing on overall well-being and addressing concerns that may not be immediately visible.

## Can You Do Keto If You Have Nash Non Alcoholic Steatohepatitis

# Can you do keto if you have NASH (Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis)?

It definitely, absolutely, positively should be done with a fatty liver because even within a couple of weeks you could end up with 50% less fat.

**\*Please keep in mind that this is just a recommendation. You should consult with your doctor if you have a medical condition and want to get on Keto.**

## How Many Grams Of Carbs Can I Eat Without Worrying About Insulin Resis 66A344

# How many grams of carbs can I eat without worrying about insulin resistance or high blood sugar?

The magic number is 50 net carbs. So don't go over 50 net carbs. That means you're minusing the fiber in some of the foods. But when we're talking about leafy green vegetables and salads, don't even count those. We want you to have more of those unless you're a bloater and you have some issues with that.

---

## Is It Possible To Do Healthy Raw Vegan Keto

# Is it possible to do healthy raw vegan keto?

Achieving ketosis while adhering to a vegan diet is indeed feasible, albeit more challenging. The primary difficulty lies in balancing macronutrients, particularly in obtaining sufficient fat and complete protein sources. Adequate intake of nutrients like zinc, typically found in animal products, may require careful attention and supplementation from alternative plant-based sources. Similarly, obtaining the active form of vitamin A, such as retinol, and essential omega-3 fatty acids can pose challenges and necessitate strategic dietary planning.

---

## Is The Ketogenic Diet A Suitable Option For Weight Gain

# Is the ketogenic diet a suitable option for weight gain?

While the ketogenic diet is often associated with weight loss, it can also offer benefits for overall health beyond just managing weight. Low-carb diets and intermittent fasting can significantly support liver health and metabolic function. However, if your goal is to gain weight on a keto diet, it requires careful planning.

To maintain or gain weight, you'll need to increase your caloric intake while ensuring your dietary fat is at an appropriate level. Consuming sufficient dietary fat is essential for producing ketones; otherwise, your body may resort to burning its own fat for energy, which can lead to weight loss rather than gain.

To achieve this, consider adding healthy fats at the end of your meals, such as macadamia nuts, pecans, or desserts made with raw cream or MCT oil. Additionally, focus on strength training exercises with lower repetitions and higher volume. This approach can help you build muscle mass and strength while following a ketogenic diet, allowing you to effectively increase your weight in a healthy manner.

---

## Can The Ketogenic Diet Have An Impact On Thyroid Function

# Can the ketogenic diet have an impact on thyroid function?

When following a well-structured and healthy ketogenic diet, thyroid function is generally not compromised. In fact, a properly implemented ketogenic approach can enhance metabolic efficiency, potentially reducing the need for higher levels of thyroid hormones. While you may observe slight decreases in T4 or T3 levels, these fluctuations typically remain within the normal range.

Hypothyroidism is commonly diagnosed through measurements of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is regulated by the pituitary gland. TSH levels are likely to remain stable when following a nutritious, low-carbohydrate diet. Therefore, there is usually no cause for concern regarding thyroid function while adhering to a healthy ketogenic lifestyle. If you have specific concerns about your thyroid health, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

## Is It Appropriate For Children To Follow A Ketogenic Diet

# Is it appropriate for children to follow a ketogenic diet?

While a strict ketogenic diet may not be appropriate for children, adopting a low-carbohydrate approach can be beneficial. Children may tolerate a higher intake of certain carbohydrates, such as fruits and occasional sweet potatoes, while avoiding typical sugary foods. It is advisable to eliminate processed cereals and grains from their diet.

I recommend focusing on three substantial meals each day rather than frequent snacking, as constant snacking can lead to repeated spikes in insulin levels. Children have a naturally high metabolism, and if they are physically active, they can effectively utilize some of the carbohydrates from fruits and other sources. As always, consulting with a healthcare professional or nutritionist is recommended to ensure that any dietary changes are appropriate for a child’s specific needs.

---

## Can Keto Improve Borderline Hypothyroidism

# Can keto improve borderline hypothyroidism?

Adopting a ketogenic diet can significantly benefit your thyroid and overall endocrine system. High-carb diets increase insulin levels, leading to insulin resistance, which can severely impact the thyroid and other endocrine functions. Some people believe they can't follow a keto diet due to conditions like diabetes or Hashimoto's, but these are actually reasons to consider it. Keto can reduce inflammation, which is particularly beneficial for autoimmune thyroid disorders. Therefore, implementing a ketogenic diet may improve your situation.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

---

## Can I Be Thin And Have Insulin Resistance

# Can I be thin and have insulin resistance?

Insulin resistance can affect individuals of all body types, including those who are thin and struggle to gain weight. It can impact blood sugar levels, mood, cognitive function, and may lead to fatty liver, which isn't always apparent physically.

When following a ketogenic diet, especially when combined with fasting, maintaining weight can be challenging.

---

## Can I Do Keto If I Have An Allergy To Nutritional Yeast And Nuts

# Can I do keto if I have an allergy to nutritional yeast and nuts?

For individuals with allergies to nutritional yeast and nuts, it is still possible to pursue a ketogenic diet, though careful consideration of food choices is necessary. For those looking to increase their intake of vitamin B1, sunflower seeds may serve as a suitable alternative, provided there are no allergies to them.

While some individuals experience sensitivities to nuts, soaking them in water for 24 hours and subsequently drying them in an oven or dehydrator may help reduce enzyme inhibitors, potentially enhancing their digestibility. However, for those who cannot consume nutritional yeast, this does limit their options for obtaining certain nutrients. It is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to tailor a ketogenic plan that accommodates dietary restrictions while ensuring adequate nutrient intake.

## Is Mct Oil Good Or Bad For The Liver

# Is MCT Oil good or bad for the liver?

Omega-3 fatty acids are very good for a fatty liver. This includes fish oil and cod liver oil. MCT oils, which are medium-chain triglycerides, are a unique type of fat that can be very good for your liver.

**MCT fats are “burned” or oxidized into energy very quickly. Unlike other oils, MCT oil is water-soluble. Why is this significant? It doesn’t depend on bile or enzymes—you don’t have to break down MCT oil at all.**

MCT oil bypasses your digestive system and is absorbed directly into the body.

**MCT oil is great for:**

• Malabsorption

• Epilepsy

• Supporting a healthy heart

• Those with no gallbladder

Keep in mind that MCT oil doesn’t contain vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids—so you’ll still need to get these in your diet when using MCTs.

---

## Can I Be In Ketosis Despite No Ketones In Urine

# Can I be in ketosis despite no ketones in urine?

**The first thing you need to know is that there are three types of ketones:**

1\. Acetate

2\. Acetoacetate

3\. Beta-hydroxybutyrate

**The specific type of keto that keto urine tests test for is acetoacetate.** Keto urine tests do not test for the other two forms of ketones. As you adapt to keto, you convert acetoacetate to beta-hydroxybutyrate. The problem is that keto urine tests cannot test for beta-hydroxybutyrate, so they may give you a false reading.

Keto urine tests can’t tell you what’s going on in the blood and other places in the body.

If you want to check for beta-hydroxybutyrate, you can get a blood test. Unfortunately, these tests can be expensive. Look for other signs that you’re in ketosis. Are you losing weight? Are you feeling good? Is your waist size getting smaller? These are signs that you’re in fat-burning mode. If your carbs are 20 grams or less each day, you’re likely in ketosis.

---

## Does Looking At Sweets Spike Your Insulin

# Does looking at sweets spike your insulin?

**The answer is no – not in a fasting state.** Looking at sweets and carbs will not cause an insulin spike. The primary triggers of blood sugar are glucose and things that turn into glucose. But, anything you eat has the potential to trigger insulin just for the fact that you ate it. If it’s more carbohydrate, it will trigger your blood sugar more. If it’s less carbohydrate and more fat, it will trigger your blood sugar less.

**Chronic high insulin can lead to insulin resistance. Other triggers that can cause a blood sugar spike:**

• Cortisol – Stress

• GIP

• Protein – especially if it’s low fat

**Common symptoms of insulin resistance**

1\. Can’t go long without eating

2\. Not satisfied

3\. Cravings

4\. Need for snacks

## What Factors Contribute To A Decreased Appetite While Following A Keto 30Faf1

# What factors contribute to a decreased appetite while following a ketogenic diet and practicing intermittent fasting?

Some people experience a decreased appetite on the Healthy Keto® diet. Although you are taking energy from your body fat and don’t feel the need of food, it is important to note that food has an additional purpose--to provide nutrients. For example if you are deficient in electrolytes and you don’t eat, you can pass out, have low blood pressure etc. While you may not feel hungry because you’re burning enough fat to keep your body supplied with energy, you still need micronutrients.

**What to do:**

If you aren’t hungry for days at a time, it’s important to still eat a nutrient-dense meal once or twice a day. Make sure the meals that you eat are rich in nutrients. Lowering your fat intake may also help you regain your appetite.

- Don’t stop eating.

    - Eat one good meal per day if you want to lose weight

    - Eat two meals per day if you want to maintain your weight

- You can lower your fat intake gradually (to improve appetite)

- Avoid appetite blockers.

## Do The Same Rules Of Keto Apply To A Type 1 Diabetic

# Do the same rules of Keto apply to a type 1 diabetic?

I just interviewed someone on this one topic. But he was a fascinating interview, this doctor who actually not, not only was he a type one diabetic, but he ran 20 miles five days in a row and on no calories. He fasted for five days and he did fine.

**So the same rules apply, same rules apply. There's all this false information that we need more carbs if we're a type one diabetic for some reason, but then you're going to just take more insulin. The whole goal is to take the least amount of insulin because that extra insulin creates more problems.**

So yeah, it's the same, same rules. But of course, because you don't have insulin, then you have no way of controlling your carbs when you eat. So you have to monitor that level.

**And there's one condition with type one diabetes that we should bring up. It's called diabetic ketoacidosis.** And that's a situation where you forget to take your insulin and you're a type one and your ketones are out of control.They go way, way, way too high. But that condition is not going to occur if you control your blood sugars with your medication. And it's definitely not going to occur if you're not a diabetic.

---

## Can The Ketogenic Diet Spike Cortisol

# Can the Ketogenic Diet spike cortisol?

Insulin resistance is a situation where the body compensate the excess carb and sugar in the diet and it is protecting itself against it. When you have higher insulin, it is going to push the blood sugars on the lower side.

**Functions of Cortisol:**

1\. Protect against hypoglycemia or low blood sugar.

2\. It stimulates Gluconeogenesis.

---

## Should I Cycle Carbs On Keto

# Should I cycle carbs on Keto?

The answer is no. You don't need carbs - there are no essential carbs. Your body can make glucose out of protein or fat. The goal is to build up your health reserve so high that you can afford an occasional deviation from your healthy eating plan.

---

## Fats Or Carbs   What Do I Crave On Keto

# Fats or carbs - what do I crave on Keto?

Do you crave proteins, carbs, or fats? If you crave protein, it could be you need more recovery because you are exercising. Just make sure you do high-quality protein like eggs. If you crave fat, it could mean you need more fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K.

Vitamin E is important in muscle and female hormones, especially during menopause. If you crave more vegetables, it usually means you need more minerals or vitamins. It could mean you have a congestive gallbladder or liver. If you crave starch, then we know you have a blood sugar problem and you need to realize it will take more time.

---

## Does Fat Put Me In Ketosis On Keto

# Does fat put me in ketosis on keto?

Many people think it takes consuming more fat to put your body into the state of ketosis.

The truth is, you don’t necessarily need to consume more fat. Instead, you need to lower your carbohydrates. Carbs affect insulin, and insulin blocks ketosis. The key is to lower your carbs.

Ketosis is also not a high-protein diet. You want to consume only a moderate amount of protein. 3-8 oz of protein is fine. You also don’t want to consume lean protein—low-fat protein can exacerbate insulin spikes. Always consume full-fat foods.

 [See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/its-not-fat-that-puts-you-in-ketosis)

## Should I Do Juicing While On Keto Or While Fasting

# Should I do juicing while on Keto or while fasting?

In general, I do not think that juicing is the best idea on keto or while fasting—unless you’re doing a juice powder. Why? Because many vegetable juices can contain more carbs than you would expect. In turn, this can low down ketosis and weight loss.

When calculating the carbs in a vegetable, you want to subtract the fiber from the total carbs, which will give you the net carbs. Juicing removes the fiber from the vegetables, which means you can no longer subtract it from the total carbs. One cup of juice will have more net carbs than one cup of whole vegetable because of the fiber content.

Additionally, juicing can remove a lot of the phytonutrients in vegetables. Phytonutrients have powerful health benefits. If you find it difficult not to have juice because of cravings, try using inositol. This is a form of natural sugar alcohol (known as vitamin B8) that helps with insulin resistance. If you can repair insulin resistance, you will have a much easier time fighting off cravings.

Bile salts can also help reduce cravings. Bile helps you break down and absorb healthy fats that keep you feeling satisfied after eating.

## Why Do Triglycerides Elevate On Keto

# Why do triglycerides elevate on keto?

Your fat is a storage place for triglycerides. When you do keto and enter a state of ketosis, the triglycerides are mobilized, and they come out of the fat cell. They’re there to be used as energy.  I believe fasting 12-14 hours before you get your triglycerides tested is very important. This way, the test isn’t affected by what you just ate or drank that may have temporarily caused your triglycerides to be higher. Consuming alcohol or carbs two days before the test can also cause your triglycerides to be temporarily high. 

**A few potential causes of high triglycerides:** 

• A hypothyroid condition 

• A problem with the gallbladder 

• The transitional phase of keto 

• Hidden carbohydrates 

• Hidden fats

## What Are 9 Ways Of Blocking The Carbs On Keto Diet

# What are 9 ways of blocking the carbs on keto diet?

Sticking to keto and intermittent fasting is the best way to meet your health goals. But, if you make a mistake on keto, it’s not the end of the world. Today, I’m going to share how to block the effects of sugar and carbs, as well as other potentially problematic things.

**1\. Sugar** • Consume fiber • Take electrolytes, B vitamins, and trace minerals

**2\. Grains** • Consume shellfish • Take glutamine or consume foods high in glutamine • Consume B vitamins (nutritional yeast) • Take vitamin E • Consume foods high in vitamin C • Consume foods high in antioxidants • Take benfotiamine • Take alpha-lipoic acid • Exercise • Take berberine • Consume cinnamon • Consume apple cider vinegar • Consume healthy fats • Do intermittent and prolonged fasting

**3\. Alcohol** • Consume vitamin B1 or nutritional yeast • Drink pickle juice or take electrolytes • Take milk thistle

**4\. Certain medications** • Take milk thistle • Take CoQ10 (if you’re on a statin) • Take vitamin B1 and B12 (if you’re on metformin) • Take a probiotic (if you take an antibiotic) • Take betaine hydrochloride (if you took an antacid)

**5\. Excess sodium** • Consume foods high in potassium

**6\. Oxalates** • Consume cheese • Consume foods high in magnesium

**7\. Excess water** • Consume sodium and other electrolytes

**8\. Keto and IF side effects** • Take electrolytes • Consume B vitamins

**9\. Stress** • Take vitamin B1, magnesium, and zinc • Exercise and physical work • Sleep

## What Are The Most Common Keto Mistakes That Slow Your Progress Down

# What are the most common Keto mistakes that slow your progress down?

Common mistakes on keto and how to address them:

1\. **Excessive Fat Consumption:** Focus on reducing carbs rather than adding more fat. Only increase fat intake if you're new to keto and need support during fasting.

2\. **Snacking:** Avoid keto snacks and stick to regular meals to minimize insulin spikes.

3\. **Hidden Carbs:** Check food labels for hidden carbs like maltodextrin. Avoid fruits, berries, and agave nectar.

4\. **Inadequate Protein Intake:** Ensure you're consuming enough quality protein to signal satiety to the brain and prevent deficiencies. Consider amino acid supplements if needed during fasting.

## Can I Take Branched Chain Amino Acids On Keto And If While Exercising

# Can I take branched chain amino acids on Keto and IF while exercising?

This will spike insulin, but it's a minor point since the insulin spike is small. The real question is WHY are you taking it in the first place.

If you are taking it for recovery, then realize that those amino acids take several hours before they are turned into protein and you would be much better off taking B-vitamins (nutritional yeast) and minerals (electrolytes), since they are the cofactors or helps in the repair of muscles and the creation (synthesis) of muscle.

If you are taking BCAA to build muscle realize that intermittent fasting, in general, will already give you a protein-sparing effect and this protects you from the loss of protein. Growth hormones are spiked too, which helps with this.

Autophagy also occurs which is the recycling of proteins from the cell, thus reducing the need for taking extra protein.

## Will Going Low Carb And Low Insulin Reduce My Muscle Mass And How Can  C28Ab0

# Will going low-carb and low-insulin reduce my muscle mass, and how can I maintain muscle while doing keto and intermittent fasting?

Maintaining muscle mass on a low-carb, low-insulin diet is possible if you follow these guidelines:

\- Keep your daily carb intake between 50-60 grams.

\- Consume 8-9 ounces of protein per meal.

\- Ensure you're not deficient in essential nutrients.

Insulin is an anabolic hormone that helps absorb amino acids, but consistently high insulin from carbs and sugar leads to insulin resistance, impairing amino acid absorption and causing muscle loss. Keto and intermittent fasting improve insulin sensitivity, enhancing amino acid and protein absorption.

For muscle maintenance and growth, incorporate weight training and increase protein intake. Aim for 8-9 ounces of high-quality protein per meal from sources like eggs, meat, and fish. Avoid high-carb foods to prevent insulin resistance.

Consider supplementing with complete amino acids for maximum efficiency in muscle building.

## Does Keto Help With Candida Infection

# Does Keto help with candida infection?

A few symptoms of Candida are achiness of joints, fatigue, itchiness of the body, and digestive issues just to name a few. You want to stay away from sugar, birth control pills can accelerate it as well as stress.

Doing intermittent fasting for at least 18 hours or more will put your body in an autophagy state in which the body would eliminate yeast, mold, fungus, and candida. Adding Thyme oil, grapefruit, and seed extract can help with the healing process.

## What Are The Potential Reasons For Memory Loss

# What are the potential reasons for memory loss?

Symptoms of memory loss have to do with the hippocampus. The hippocampus is an area of the brain that is responsible for short-term, long-term and spatial memory (remembering things that are located somewhere--for example where you parked your car).

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiency**

There are several nutrients that are vital for the healthy functioning of the brain. If you are deficient in those nutrients, the hippocampus is the part of your brain that will be affected most. The good thing is that it can regenerate if you restore your normal levels of the nutrients.

\- Vitamin B1 is a very important vitamin for healthy brain function, as well as for your nervous system.

\- Vitamin D has many health-related functions, including healthy development and upkeep of the brain. Out of all brain areas that are affected by a D deficiency, the hippocampus feels the lack of vitamin D most.

\- If you are deficient in zinc (mineral) your hippocampus won’t work properly, resulting in short- term memory problems.

\- Additionally, If your brain doesn’t have enough oxygen this can result in damage to the hippocampus.

**Remedies:**

- Restore vitamin B1 in your body:

    - take nutritional yeast

    - avoid refined carbs and sugar

    - avoid things and people that stress you out

    - take long walks

- Restore vitamin D in your body:

    - take vitamin D3 (10,000 to 20,000 IU daily)

    - take virgin cod liver oil

- Restore zinc in your body:

    - consume beef liver

    - consume shellfish

    - take a zinc supplement

- Restore oxygen in your body:

    - exercise

    - take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes)

    - hyperbaric oxygen therapy

**Cause #2: High-carb diet**

If you are on a high-carb diet this can result in a brain starvation as blood sugar is not the best source of fuel for your brain, including the hippocampus. There is another type of fuel that your brain loves: ketones (a byproduct of your body burning its own fat). Additionally, intermittent fasting will trigger certain processes that will regenerate your hippocampus.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid refined carbs and sweets

- Avoid snacking

- Take MCT oil (source of ketones)

- Take exogenous ketones supplement

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do intermittent fasting

**Cause #3: High cortisol**

Cortisol is a stress hormone that is being produced by your adrenals (stress-regulating glands). High amounts of cortisol can damage your hippocampus. The solution to that would be to improve your mental and physical stress resistance and recovery.

**Remedies:**

- Consume vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

- Improve sleep (take naps if needed)

- Take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes)

- Avoid things or people that stress you out

- You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support

- You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Other causes:**

- Aging (Healthy Keto + intermittent fasting will help)

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Short Term Memory Loss

# What are the potential causes of short-term memory loss?

Short-term memory loss can create a lot of difficulties that make life harder. The area of the brain that is responsible for your short-term memory is called the hippocampus. Any type of damage to the hippocampus can cause problems with memory in general.

**Symptoms:**

- Asking the same questions repeatedly

- Forgetting where you just put something

- Forgetting recent events

- Forgetting something you saw or read recently

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiency**

There are several nutrients that are vital for the healthy functioning of the brain. If you are deficient in these nutrients, the hippocampus will be affected most. The good thing is that it can regenerate if you restore your normal levels of those nutrients.

\-Vitamin B1 is a very important vitamin for healthy brain function as well as for your nervous system.

\-Vitamin D has many health-related functions, including healthy development and upkeep of the brain. Out of all the brain areas that are affected by vitamin D deficiency, the hippocampus feels the deficiency most.

## What Strategies Can I Implement To Avoid Weight Gain After Completing  4Df024

# What strategies can I implement to avoid weight gain after completing a ketogenic diet?

It is advisable to maintain carbohydrate intake at 50 grams or more per day, with protein consumption limited to a maximum of 8 ounces. For those practicing intermittent fasting, consuming two meals per day is recommended.

If there are no compelling reasons to discontinue the ketogenic diet, it may be beneficial to continue with it to reap its potential advantages.

## How Does Dietary Fiber Influence Blood Sugar Levels And What Mechanism E1D2A5

# How does dietary fiber influence blood sugar levels, and what mechanisms underlie its role in regulating glucose metabolism?

Fiber plays a crucial role in moderating blood sugar levels by affecting the glycemic load of foods. Foods high in fiber, like carrots, have a low glycemic load because fiber slows the absorption of carbohydrates, preventing rapid spikes in blood sugar. For example, despite carrots having a relatively high glycemic index of 72, their glycemic load is very low at 3 due to their fiber content. In contrast, foods with low fiber, such as potatoes, can have a high glycemic load, with a boiled potato scoring 31. Therefore, incorporating high-fiber foods can help stabilize blood sugar levels by reducing the glycemic load, just be sure to check the glycemic index before consumption.

## What Are The Common Symptoms Associated With Histamine Intolerance

# What are the common symptoms associated with histamine intolerance?

Histamine is involved in the immune system, and it’s present in certain foods. If you have histamine intolerance, your body will react to it with inflammation, fatigue, congestion and other symptoms.

Additionally, if you’ve had damage to your stomach or your intestines you could be deficient in a certain enzyme that helps you break down histamines.

**Symptoms:**

- Headaches

- Migraines

- Stuffy sinuses

- Diarrhea

- Asthma

- Palpitations

- Red skin

- Hives/itchiness

- Vertigo

- Low blood pressure

Consuming foods high in histamines

Consuming foods high in histamines will cause them to be high in your body. Your body as a result can treat them as dangerous compounds and activate your immune system when they are detected, causing a reaction to them.

## I Want To Go On A Ketogenic Diet But I Dont Want To Cause Kidney Stone C183Ed

# I want to go on a ketogenic diet, but I don’t want to cause kidney stones. What can I do to prevent them?

To prevent kidney stones or gout on the ketogenic plan, consider these tips:

1\. Increase citrates by adding 1 lemon to your water daily. Despite being acidic, lemon turns alkaline in the body, which helps prevent stone formation.

2\. Consume ample vegetables to ensure sufficient nutrient intake.

3\. Stay hydrated by increasing fluid intake, and consider adding 1 tsp of sea salt per day or electrolyte powder to maintain hydration.

4\. Avoid cruciferous vegetables and spinach to reduce oxalate intake. If you do consume foods high in oxalates, pair them with calcium-rich foods in the same meal to bind oxalates and prevent stone formation. Avoid consuming oxalates and calcium separately to prevent stone formation.\]

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## Can I Do Keto And Intermittent Fasting If Im A Diabetic On Metformin A 35Db2E

# Can I do Keto and Intermittent Fasting if I'm a diabetic on metformin and insulin?

Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, both conditions involve high blood sugar and insulin. Metformin makes insulin receptors more responsive, while insulin replaces what the pancreas lacks. In type 1 diabetes, insulin is used to control unstable blood sugars, often resulting in high insulin levels. High insulin is more dangerous than high sugar, as it can damage the retina, kidneys, arteries, and brain. The goal is to minimize insulin use. For type 1 diabetes, despite potentially irreversibly damaged beta cells, it's crucial to reduce insulin use by focusing on diet and intermittent fasting to lower carb intake and improve insulin resistance. Work with your doctor to adjust medications accordingly.

## Is It Possible To Alleviate Migraines By Following A Ketogenic Diet

# Is it possible to alleviate migraines by following a ketogenic diet?

There are many things that can cause a migraine headache. But ketones can potentially help your brain in many ways.

A study in 1930 demonstrated that 28% of migraine sufferers reported having no migraines after being on keto. 25% of migraine sufferers reported less frequent migraines after being on keto.

Recent evidence suggests that migraines may stem from a cerebral energy deficiency. Part of the brain may not be getting energy. This could also relate to insulin resistance, which could be one reason why ketones may be effective. Ketones actually provide an alternative fuel to the brain.

The other factor that may contribute to a migraine is too much oxidative stress compared to how much antioxidant capacity you have. Ketones can act as an antioxidant.

Ketones may not only protect you from free-radical damage, but also they may act as an anti- inflammatory. Your brain loves ketones and actually prefers ketones over glucose.

**Potential benefits of ketones for the brain:**

- Can help improve your mood

- Can help improve your cognitive function (memory, focus and concentration)

- May help improve epilepsy

- Could help increase mitochondria function

- Can help reduce oxidative stress

If you have migraines, you may want to get on the ketogenic diet. It may also be beneficial to consume MCT oil and even exogenous ketones to help boost your ketones further.

**How to help supply the brain with ketones:**

- Do Healthy Keto®

- Eliminate snacks (do intermittent fasting)

## What Are Effective Ways To Increase Energy Levels While Following A Ke 624E94

# What are effective ways to increase energy levels while following a ketogenic diet?

Feeling tired on keto can result from poor sleep, stress, nutritional deficiencies, or the adaptation phase as your body transitions to burning fat. Increasing B vitamins or potassium may help.

Fatigue can also be linked to mitochondrial health. Mitochondria produce ATP, and oxidative stress from smoking, pollution, and high sugar can damage them. Antioxidants, especially from whole foods like cruciferous vegetables and omega-3-rich sources, help combat this damage.

Avoid synthetic antioxidants; focus on natural sources. If you're not getting enough high-quality vegetables, consider adding a plant-based shake for a week to boost energy. Keto can be challenging, but it’s a protective mechanism worth maintaining!

## How Often Should You Take A Break From Keto

# How often should you take a break from keto?

Healthy Keto® with intermittent fasting will work while you do it, but the benefits will stop if you stop. You might see some awesome keto diet results, or intermittent fasting results, and think it’s okay to stop. But the long-term effects of keto are so beneficial, you really don’t want to stop or take a break.

The purpose of doing the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting is so much more than just weight loss. Doing keto long-term is a way of eating to minimize health problems. You will eventually build up your health reserve and you will be able to go off of the program here and there. But, there are no phases of the ketogenic diet. After you reach your keto weight-loss goal, instead of adding in carbs, you can add in more calories and more fat.

---

## How Can I Increase Fat Intake On Keto

# How can I increase fat intake on keto?

To ensure sufficient fat intake on keto and intermittent fasting:

1\. Incorporate healthy fats into your diet, such as:

\- Avocado

\- Olive oil

\- Coconut oil

\- Nuts and seeds

\- Fatty fish

2\. Listen to your hunger cues rather than focusing solely on reaching a specific fat percentage. Eat until satisfied, adjusting fat intake accordingly.

3\. Allow your body to utilize its own fat stores for energy by gradually reducing fat intake as weight loss progresses.

4\. During maintenance phases, increase dietary fat to maintain weight, but adjust intake as needed to align with energy requirements.

## How Much Water Should I Drink On Keto

# How much water should I drink on keto?

It’s best to drink water only when you are thirsty. Water myths:

- 60% of the body is water – false

- The body doesn’t know when it’s thirsty – false

- Water flushes out fat – false

- Water flushes out toxins – false

- Water helps dry skin – false

The people who drink the most water are actually the most dehydrated because of the difference it makes in their electrolytes, since too much water can flush out the electrolytes you need in your body.

Hyponatremia is a condition where you can get really sick or even die because of drinking too much water.

Dr. Berg says he drinks about 2 to 3 cups of water a day.

Your body adjusts to maintain a natural balance. Just make sure to drink only when you’re thirsty.

## How Much Fat Per Day Is Best On Keto

# How much fat per day is best on keto?

On average, consume 20 to 40 grams of fat per meal. Multiply by how many meals you eat to get the total.

However, the best way to determine how much fat you need to consume is to base it on how you feel. If you feel satisfied with the meal and it allows you to not be hungry until the next meal, then that might be the best amount for you.

## Can The Ketogenic Diet Lead To Feelings Of Fatigue

# Can the ketogenic diet lead to feelings of fatigue?

It can, during the transition period or if you do it incorrectly. It can mean:

- You need more B vitamins (especially B1 and B5) – these 2 vitamins are crucial in the metabolism and the ability to make energy

- A need to increase potassium (eat large quantities of vegetables)

- Deficiency of stomach acids (apple cider vinegar, sea salt, betaine hydrochloride )

- Hidden carbohydrates in your food

- Decreased blood sugars (feeling tired)

- High blood sugar (tired after eating)

- Need for more sleep

There might be other reasons behind tiredness that are not keto-related. It could be connected to digestion, or stress or inflammation, for example. Try to handle the root cause while following a Healthy Keto® plan.

## Can I Get Rid Of Kidney Stones On Keto

# Can I get rid of kidney stones on keto?

The ketogenic diet itself doesn't directly counter kidney stones, but certain remedies can help prevent them:

1\. Phytic acid can prevent calcium crystallization, a common cause of kidney stones. Increase intake by consuming moderate protein and plenty of vegetables.

2\. Take vitamin C to bind with calcium and prevent stone formation.

3\. Stay hydrated and add electrolytes to your fluids, especially if sedentary.

4\. Drink lemon water and ensure adequate intake of vitamin B6 and calcium-rich foods like grass-fed dairy.

5\. Consider calcium orotate as a supplement, as it may reduce calcium buildup in the kidneys.

6\. Address magnesium deficiency, but if consuming ample vegetables, additional supplementation may not be necessary.

If you've strayed from the keto plan, simply resume it along with intermittent fasting. Gradually transition into ketosis, reduce snacking, and supplement with potassium, sodium, and nutritional yeast. Additionally, take the opportunity to deepen your understanding of the ketogenic diet to enhance self-control and success.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

## What Supplements Should I Take On Keto

# What supplements should I take on keto?

Here is the list of the most important nutrients needed for keto, along with sources for them.

- Minerals

- Vitamin B1 (needed in conversion from sugar to fat burning)

- Vitamin B3 (to remove fat and cholesterol from the liver)

- Vitamin B5 (for the conversion from sugar to fat burning; helps in keto-adaptation and prevents ketogenic fatigue, flu and rash

- Vitamin A (improves insulin resistance)

- Vitamin D (improves insulin resistance)

- Choline (to help a fatty liver)

Virgin cod liver oil helps to provide vitamin D and A equally. Nutritional yeast provides the B vitamins.

Electrolyte powder helps provide the minerals.

## Is It Possible To Follow A Ketogenic Diet Without A Gallbladder

# Is it possible to follow a ketogenic diet without a gallbladder?

Yes.

With the keto diet, 75% of your calories are coming from fat. The purpose of the gallbladder is to store and concentrate bile, which is the detergent that breaks down fats. Foods, especially fats, trigger the release of bile. Bile helps absorb fat-soluble vitamins, essential fatty acids, etc.

Without a gallbladder, you could have incomplete fat digestion or a deficiency in important fat-soluble vitamins.

You could try taking Dr. Berg’s Gallbladder Formula (see drberg.com) if you don’t have a gallbladder, to get more purified bile salts. This could potentially help you have enough bile to support complete digestion. You may also want to do intermittent fasting along with the keto diet.

**\*We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.**

---

## How Much Water Do I Drink On Keto

# How much water do I drink on Keto?

Some people drink about 2 to 3 cups of water a day. Your body adjusts to maintain a natural balance. Just make sure only to drink when you’re thirsty.

But when fasting, you’re losing glycogen. With the glycogen loss (stored sugar), you’re also going to lose a lot of fluid. This fluid isn’t just water. It’s a combination of water, electrolytes and salts – which need to go back into the body.

It would be a good idea for someone to consume between 2 and 3 liters of water per day while fasting. This quantity could also help prevent kidney stones. You would want to be sure to add electrolytes and sea salt. Forgetting electrolytes and sea salt can potentially lead to keto fatigue, keto flu and overall weakness.

Make sure to consume water when you are thirsty only, to avoid overhydration with its problems.

---

## How Long Does It Take To See Results On Keto

# How long does it take to see results on keto?

It really depends. When someone begins to do keto and intermittent fasting, they typically lose a lot of water weight in the first week, maybe even 8 pounds.

But then, in the second week, they are hardly losing weight at all: maybe 2 pounds. Well, the maximum amount of fat you can lose per week with a healthy metabolism is only 2 pounds. One half to 2 pounds is actually very good.

Your metabolism is living and dynamic, and it adapts to the foods you eat. When you’re not consistent with keto and intermittent fasting, this can slow down the weight loss and can potentially cause problems.

---

## How Fast Will I Lose Weight On Keto

# How fast will I lose weight on keto?

On a Healthy Keto® diet, individuals can generally expect to lose approximately 2 pounds of fat per week, with the inclusion of intermittent fasting potentially accelerating this process. Initially, weight loss may be more significant, with individuals losing between 7 to 15 pounds in the first week, largely attributed to the loss of water weight associated with glycogen depletion. Various factors can influence weight loss on the ketogenic diet, including age, activity level, gender, metabolism, overall health, dietary choices, and stress levels.

---

## Does The Keto Diet Raise Cholesterol

# Does the keto diet raise cholesterol?

It may temporarily increase cholesterol.

This is an oversimplified talk and for more detailed data see Dr. Eric Berg’s video on LDL. However, as your fat cells shrink, the fat cell not only releases triglycerides, but cholesterol too. Many people do not know that fat cells are filled with both. The excess cholesterol either has to be eliminated through the liver and gallbladder (bile) or be recycled. This is all a normal process in ketosis; therefore it may increase cholesterol, but it’s a temporary effect.

As the fat cell shrinks, you can burn the triglycerides for fuel but you cannot burn the cholesterol because it is not a fuel source. It is going to be eliminated as you lose weight. As the fat cell is squeezed, the cholesterol is going to increase in the blood and is going to go into the liver and come out with the bile. As long as your liver is healthy and you’re eating a lot of vegetables, and as long as you have enough bile, you are totally fine even if your LDL is high.

The key thing is to make sure that your triglycerides are low because if you are not using your triglycerides as a fuel then there is a problem – you are probably eating too much sugar. When you are on a ketogenic diet and you are doing it correctly, and your triglycerides are low and your HDL and LDL are high, all that means is that you are burning more LDL and there are no bad effects that are going to happen. Just keep your vegetables high and as you come closer to your weight-loss goal, that will level out and come back to normal.

## Is It Possible To Lose Weight On A Ketogenic Diet Without Exercising

# Is it possible to lose weight on a ketogenic diet without exercising?

Yes. The diet contributes 85% of the progress with weight loss and exercise contributes only 15%. But then, there are benefits of exercise for your weight goal.

Benefits of exercise:

- Increases oxygen

- Lowers stress

- Increases fitness

- Tones

- Atrophy (Women going through menopause may experience atrophy in thighs and butt. Exercise helps overcome this atrophy.)

- Increases and prevents the loss of muscle mass

- Stabilizes blood sugars

- Improves sleep

- Improves stiff joints

- Increases / improves blood flow

- Strengthens heart

If you have an adrenal problem, the key is to keep the duration of exercise very short, the intensity very high, and the recovery very long. It is also important not to overtrain.

---

## Does Keto Make Your Pee Smell

# Does keto make your pee smell?

It can, during the keto adaptation period.

If you are on a keto diet, the smell usually comes from the ketones that aren’t being burned. This often happens if you’re still adapting to keto. Keto adaptation can take several weeks. Over time, you will burn those ketones and they won’t cause an odor.

If you are not on a ketogenic diet and you’re not doing intermittent fasting, but you’re getting a stinky urine odor, it could be a urinary tract infection, liver damage, eating the wrong foods, or not having enough vegetables.

Here’s what you can do for a strong urine odor:

- Liver support – consume plenty of healthy vegetables (like beet tops and dandelion greens)

- Fluids – drink plenty of water throughout the day

- Adjust proteins – lower your protein (3 to 6 oz is plenty)

- Chlorophyll – wheatgrass juice powder is a great source of it

---

## How Long Does Keto Breath Last

# How long does Keto breath last?

It can last from a few days up to 3 weeks. It is usually a sign of keto adaptation.

What you need to do is:

- Be strict with your carbs, bringing them below 20 grams per day

- Do intermittent fasting as this will speed things up and drop insulin

- Consume a little more fluid with electrolytes to encourage the body to release ketones out of the urine instead of in your breath

- Consume more foods with chlorophyll (in vegetables)

---

## Does Keto Cause Headaches

# Does keto cause headaches?

The phrenic nerve goes underneath the diaphragm on the right and left sides and it extends all the way up to the neck and head. On the right side, the phrenic nerve is very close to the gallbladder. If there is any type of congestion with the gallbladder, or bloating, it will put pressure on that nerve. So, if you have a headache on the right side of your head or neck pain on the right side, it could be related to the gallbladder.

When you’re on a ketogenic diet, you’re going to be consuming more fats. When you consume more fats, your body has to adapt to digesting them. You have to have enough bile for the process of digesting the fats. So your gallbladder could be a little overloaded – causing a headache. But it usually goes away pretty fast as your body adjusts to the fat-burning.

## Can Keto Burn Fat

# Can keto burn fat?

Of course! As long as you do it correctly.

## What Are Enzymes

# What are enzymes?

Enzymes are like tiny little worker bees in your body. They do the work of breaking down carbohydrates, fats, proteins and other raw nutrients.

When you have a meal, you trigger the release of enzymes. Your body tells your pancreas what types of enzymes to release based on the kinds of nutrients you have ingested. Specific enzymes break down specific nutrients.

## Why Arent My Blood Sugar Levels Lowering With Intermittent Fasting And Af83F0

# Why aren't my blood sugar levels lowering with intermittent fasting and ketosis?

You likely have severe insulin resistance with high insulin and poor cell absorption, leading to high blood sugars. To lower your blood sugars, try the following:

**1\. Reevaluate Your Diet:** Ensure you're consuming protein, carbs, and fats properly and eating enough vegetables. Consider reducing your carbohydrate intake—if you eat 50 grams a day, cut it to 20; if 20 grams, reduce to 10 grams.

**2\. Reduce Meal Frequency:** Shorten your eating window by consuming fewer meals.

**3\. Increase Nutrients:** Add B vitamins (from nutritional yeast), potassium (from electrolytes), zinc, and chromium to your diet.

**4\. Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve insulin resistance.

**5\. Address Health Issues:** Focus on the most significant health issues you have and work on improving them.

**6\. Improve Sleep and Manage Stress:** If you have insomnia or high stress, take steps to address these.

**7\. Be Patient:** It may take more time on keto and intermittent fasting to see improvements in your blood sugars.

## What Type Of Exercise Will Burn Fat

# What type of exercise will burn fat?

Short-duration, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is effective for heart health and weight loss. Examples include spin biking, slamball, plyometrics, and sprinting. HIIT can boost VO2 max, growth hormone, and testosterone levels. The key is to alternate brief, intense exercise intervals with adequate recovery periods to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system. A recommended HIIT routine involves 20-second intense workouts followed by 2 to 4 minutes of rest, repeated for 3 to 7 sets. Incorporating HIIT into your routine for 20 to 40 minutes can yield fat-burning effects lasting up to 48 hours post-workout.

---

## What Are The Side Effects Of Keto Beta Hydroxybutyrate Bhb

# What are the side effects of keto beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)?

While beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) supplements may increase ketone levels detected in urine, they don't necessarily promote fat burning or weight loss. In fact, relying on exogenous ketones like BHB may negate the primary goal of ketogenic diets, which is to derive energy from fat stores. A cost-effective alternative to BHB supplements is MCT oil, which can support ketosis and fat burning more efficiently. It's important to consider the potential financial drawbacks of BHB supplements, as they may not provide the desired weight loss benefits.

## Can I Take Melatonin For Sleep On Keto

# Can I take melatonin for sleep on keto?

I’m not recommending taking melatonin–unless you are using it for a specific condition. Your body can make its own melatonin naturally.

It’s true that your melatonin levels will drop with age, but you can support them through your diet and other lifestyle choices.

Here’s how you can improve your melatonin levels:

- Avoid light at night

- Get plenty of sun and vitamin D during the day

- Decrease your exposure to blue light in the evening

- Avoid eating before bed

- Get your glucose under control (low-carb keto diet!)

- Avoid TV before bed

The best foods for improving melatonin are mushrooms, eggs, fish and nuts.

## Why Might Keto Not Be Effective For Me

# Why might Keto not be effective for me?

Healthy Keto® emphasizes a balanced macronutrient approach paired with nutrient-dense foods to optimize various health indicators, including energy levels, skin health, weight loss, cognitive function, inflammation, mood, cravings, and hunger management.

To implement keto effectively, consider the following guidelines:

\- **Avoid Fruits and Snacking**: Minimize intake of high-carb fruits and refrain from snacking between meals.

\- **Eat Only When Hungry**: Focus on true hunger cues rather than eating out of habit.

\- **Prioritize Healthy Fats and Greens**: Ensure that the majority of your diet consists of higher-fat foods and leafy greens.

\- **Incorporate Apple Cider Vinegar**: This can aid digestion and support metabolic health.

Aim for a protein intake of 3 to 6 ounces per meal, with fat comprising approximately 70% of your total caloric intake, and carbohydrates limited to 20 to 50 grams per day. For optimal results, consider combining the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting, which can further enhance metabolic flexibility and support weight loss goals.

## How Do You Do And Read A Urine Test

# How do you do and read a urine test?

Urine test strips are not made to diagnose anything. They are simply there to give you clues to potential irregularities in your body. Follow the instructions coming with the packaging of these strips.

Most urine test strips test 10 things:

- **Protein – too much could be a sign of kidney disease, dehydration, intense exercise or a kidney stone**

- **Leukocytes – high levels could suggest an infection, UTI or kidney stone**

- **Ketones – a potential sign that you’re on a low-carb diet, or you have diabetes**

- **Glucose – levels higher than 180 could indicate diabetes**

- **Nitrites – could be a sign of nitrate-reducing bacteria, such as E. coli or gonorrhea**

- **Blood – could indicate a UTI, intense exercise or kidney stones**

- **Urobilinogen – could be a sign of liver damage, cirrhosis or hepatitis**

- **pH – levels between 6 and 7.5 could indicate uric acid stones or too much protein**

- **Specific gravity – highly-concentrated urine could indicate dehydration**

- **Bilirubin – could be an early sign of liver damage or a blocked bile duct**

## Is Keto Bad For You

# Is keto bad for you?

Keto isn't inherently bad; it simply means fat burning. However, the quality of your food choices matters. Healthy Keto® emphasizes high-quality, nutrient-rich foods, while regular keto may overlook this aspect. Ketoacidosis, a dangerous condition, is rare and typically only occurs in specific circumstances like uncontrolled type 1 diabetes. In Healthy Keto, fat burning occurs without risking ketoacidosis, making it a safe and beneficial approach.

## Do I Have To Exercise To Get Results On Keto

# Do I have to exercise to get results on keto?

It is not a must, but it is recommended that you exercise on a keto diet.

Diet contributes to 85% of your progress with weight loss and 15% comes from exercise.

You can see that exercise is a small percentage that does have benefits to help you hit your goal. However, it has many other benefits as well.

## Why Should I Consume Apple Cider Vinegar For Weight Loss On Keto

# Why should I consume apple cider vinegar for weight loss on keto?

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is effective due to its acetic acid content. Acetic acid aids mineral absorption, mobilizes calcium, improves protein digestion, and boosts the immune system. ACV also helps improve blood sugar levels by increasing glucose sensitivity, leading to less insulin production and more fat burning.

Many people have overly alkaline blood pH. ACV, being acidic with a pH of 2.5, can slightly alter body pH, enhancing mineral transport, enzyme function, thyroid stimulation, and metabolism. It's also beneficial for stomach issues like heartburn, acid reflux, GERD, and indigestion, often caused by too alkaline conditions. As we age, our stomachs become more alkaline, so we need more acid.

## Should I Take Exogenous Ketones To Help Me Be Successful On Keto

# Should I take exogenous ketones to help me be successful on keto?

You probably don’t need this if you are doing the ketogenic diet for real, eating healthily and doing intermittent fasting.

Exogenous means coming externally to the body, versus endogenous which means coming directly from the body. Exogenous ketones have become increasingly popular – promoting getting into ketosis within 3 hours. But doing this doesn’t emphasize correcting your diet, and it doesn’t require you to cut your carbs as low.

Using this sort of product completely defeats the purpose of keto and intermittent fasting. Taking these ketone salts doesn’t necessarily mean that your body is burning your own fat as fuel; you could actually just be burning ketones from the supplement and might not even lose any weight.

When you are on the ketogenic diet you create your own endogenous ketones by decreasing your carbs and using your own body fat as fuel.

## Is It Okay To Do Carb Cycling On Keto And Intermittent Fasting

# Is it okay to do carb cycling on keto and intermittent fasting?

Avoid carb cycling on keto and intermittent fasting. Consuming refined carbs disrupts ketosis, switching your body to sugar burning.

People often crave carbs because of low blood sugar and energy. However, incorporating carbs blocks keto, which relies on very low carb intake.

With proper adaptation, you'll transition to fat burning efficiently, maintaining high endurance and stable performance. Aim to build a strong health reserve so occasional deviations from keto have minimal impact.

## Are Ketones Toxic Byproducts Or Therapeutic Fuels And What Factors Aff 40Af08

# Are ketones toxic byproducts or therapeutic fuels, and what factors affect their role in metabolism and health?

A woman asked me how to respond to her doctor, who told her that being in ketosis is life-threatening. This is completely untrue - yet it’s a surprisingly common mistake that medical professionals make. They confuse nutritional ketosis with another condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, which is indeed life-threatening. It happens if you’re a type 1 diabetic who runs out of insulin, which allows your ketone levels to rise to dangerous amounts. But if you’re not a type 1 diabetic, you won’t run out of insulin, and you aren’t at risk for ketoacidosis.

By contrast, you get into ketosis by dropping your carbohydrate consumption. Your body turns its own fat, and the fat you eat, into ketones. Ketones are therapeutic for your body. They aren’t dangerous!

A lot of research is being done on the benefits of ketones for someone with a brain injury. Ketones are a more efficient fuel. They need less oxygen and produce less waste than glucose. They’re neuroprotective; they guard against nerve damage caused by high levels of glucose. When you switch to a ketogenic diet, you can actually recover damaged brain cells. Your energy goes up; your need for sleep decreases; you can actually decrease your blood flow by nearly forty percent.

Being in ketosis can help prevent protein from accumulating in the brain, preventing the amyloid plaques that lead to Alzheimer’s.

A real danger is high levels of glucose, which can cause substantial health problems, including:

• Brain Shrinkage

• Fluid retention

• Memory loss

• Mood disorders

• Oxidative damage

• Glycation

• Fatigue

• Lowered oxygen levels

• Amyloid plaques

See how therapeutic ketones truly are?

## I Had A Cheat Day. Now How Do I Recover

# I had a cheat day. Now how do I recover?

Take these nutrients individually to recover faster from a cheat meal: 

- Magnesium

- Potassium

- Vitamin B1

- Vitamin D

They will help stabilize your blood sugar, improve insulin resistance, and buffer the effects of high sugar to a certain degree.

Incorporate exercise to burn up the excess sugar that you have consumed.

Get right on a fasting program. Fast longer to make up the damage from the cheat meal. This will bring your insulin back down to where you need it to be, and your body will burn up the excess sugar and tap into fat again.

When you go off the keto plan do not spread this out over a long period of time. Do it for a short period of time and get right back on. The longer you are off, the harder it will be to get back.

## If I Lose Weight On Keto Will I End Up With Loose Sagging Belly Skin

# If I lose weight on keto, will I end up with loose, sagging belly skin?

Following a Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting can prevent loose skin after weight loss if done correctly. Your skin, the largest organ in the body, heals as you get healthier, improving collagen structure. Loose skin, or atrophy, often results from a protein deficiency worsened by insulin resistance, a common issue in weight gain.

The ketogenic diet addresses insulin resistance, enabling amino acids to enter cells and form proteins, which helps tighten the skin. During this process, you might experience a weight plateau as muscle, which is heavier than fat, rebuilds. However, you’ll notice your size shrinking and your waist getting smaller.

Combining keto with intermittent fasting spikes growth hormone levels up to 2000%, further preserving protein and supporting skin recovery.

## Is Keto Not For Me If I Feel Better On Carbs

# Is keto not for me if I feel better on carbs?

To answer that question, first let’s cover why you feel better on carbs.

Usually in this situation you are dealing with low blood sugars (hypoglycemia). With this condition you will find that you can’t go from one meal to the next without feeling irritable or you can’t handle going a certain amount of time without eating some carbs.

When you consume sugar or refined carbs this will raise your blood sugar and you will feel better. However, shortly after you will feel cravings and hunger again. This is because your body will produce insulin to lower the blood sugars.

So if you feel better on carbs it simply means you have insulin and blood sugar problems and a ketogenic diet is definitely for you. Once you get through the transition period (to fat burning), you will feel uplifted, with more energy and better cognitive function.

## Is It Possible To Reverse Diabetes Through The Implementation Of A Hea 5C0F13

# Is it possible to reverse diabetes through the implementation of a healthy diet, and what specific dietary changes or nutritional strategies have shown the most promise in achieving this outcome?

Yes, it’s possible to reverse diabetes with a nutritious, low-carb diet. Restricting carbohydrates helps promote balanced blood sugar levels and enhances insulin sensitivity, two crucial factors in restoring the body’s ability to regulate blood glucose and reverse diabetes.

---

## Does Keto Require You To Eat A Lot Of Fat To Lose Weight

# Does keto require you to eat a lot of fat to lose weight?

You would consume more fat than usual on the ketogenic diet, compared to the standard American diet.

On average, you would have to get about 70% of your calories from fat. Healthy fats allow you to remain satisfied until your next meal and will support your body with needed fat-soluble vitamins.

On average, consume 20 to 40 g of fat every meal. This will supply you with needed nutrients and calories so it’s easier to keep winning with the keto regime.

## How Do We Calculate Net Carbs

# How do we calculate net carbs?

Net carbs are the total carbohydrates (grams) minus fiber. Deduct the fiber carbs from the total to give you “net carbs.”

## What Are The Keto Food Ratios

# What are the keto food ratios?

The percent of carbs should be 5% of the calories in your diet (low)

Your protein should be roughly 20% (moderate) and

The percent of fat should be 75% (high).

Don’t count carbohydrates from vegetables in this equation since these carbs are mainly fiber and will not raise insulin too much.

Dr. Berg recommends consuming 7 to 10 cups of salad veggies (leafy greens) per day. If you are eating other vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, etc. you would need less (3.5 to 4 cups).

## Do Women Need More Carbs On Keto And Intermittent Fasting

# Do women need more carbs on Keto and Intermittent Fasting?

A lot of women ask because when they eat carbohydrates, they feel better. You might be one of them. So it seems logical to conclude you need carbs. When you’re intermittent fasting but not yet keto-adapted, and your blood sugar drops, your brain function takes a hit. You may feel moody, irritable, and have brain fog. Then you eat carbs, and you feel so much better.

But what’s really going on is that your body isn’t responding to insulin correctly. You have insulin resistance. In response, your pancreas makes several times more insulin than is healthy. The combination of high insulin and intermittent fasting crashes your blood sugar, and you feel terrible.

**The solution is to fix the insulin resistance and get your insulin levels normal, not eat more carbs. You heal insulin resistance by keeping carbs low, and by fasting. Once you fully adapt to fat for fuel, your brain will no longer need carbohydrates to function well.
**
It takes time to teach your body to burn fat and be in ketosis. Eating certain foods and easing into intermittent fasting will help you feel better. Give your brain time to adapt to fat burning. If you still get symptoms like brain fog and irritability, add more protein instead of carbohydrates.

**My answer is no, women don’t need more carbs on keto and intermittent fasting. You just need to fully understand what’s happening within your body. Then move gradually into the keto diet and intermittent fasting.**

## Is Keto Effective Without Intermittent Fasting

# Is Keto effective without intermittent fasting?

While keto is an effective diet that can improve overall health and reduce insulin resistance on its own, it is much more effective when combined with intermittent fasting. Even on a low-carb diet, the more often you eat, the more often you are raising your insulin levels. Intermittent fasting helps keep insulin levels low, making sure you stay in ketosis and lose weight more effectively. Intermittent fasting will also help you break any snacking habits you may have, further increasing the effectiveness of your keto diet.

## Does Fasting Help With Visceral Belly Fat

# Does fasting help with visceral belly fat?

Correct intermittent fasting patterns can target visceral fat. The key lies in maintaining a consistent ketogenic diet in combination with intermittent fasting, unlike patterns such as every-other-day fasting or the 5:2 method, which can slow down weight loss by disrupting the body's fuel adaptation process. For optimal results in targeting belly fat and correcting metabolism, combining keto with intermittent fasting is recommended.

## Whats The Difference Between Ketogenic Diet And Intermittent Fasting

# What's the difference between ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting?

The ketogenic diet (keto) and intermittent fasting are two different dietary approaches with different focuses. Keto is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that aims to induce ketosis, where the body burns fat for fuel, by strictly reducing sugar and carb intake. In contrast, intermittent fasting centers on the timing of meals, alternating between periods of eating and fasting, without specifying what foods to eat.

While keto requires significant changes to food choices to maintain specific macronutrient ratios, intermittent fasting offers flexibility and can be combined with various diets, including keto. Combining keto and intermittent fasting can have many health benefits, including weight loss and autophagy (cellular renewal).

## Can A Ketogenic Diet Help Reverse Kidney Disease

# Can a ketogenic diet help reverse kidney disease?

High levels of glucose and insulin create oxidative damage to four tissues; brain (nerves), heart, eye, and kidney. B-hydroxybutyrate that is in ketone can provide an alternative fuel, it also has benefits for the kidney and decreases oxidative stress. Ketosis can counter the damage from a high-carb diet.

**Important Points:**

• Potassium is protective of the kidney

• Certain amino acids can slow progression of kidney damage

• It is important to consume nutrient-dense foods – it protects against the side effects and complications of the oxidation

• low carb diet – it is very beneficial to the kidney

***We recommend consulting with your doctor before making any dietary changes, especially if you have any existing health conditions.***

## Why Do I Have Increased Cholesterol On A Ketogenic Diet

# Why do I have increased cholesterol on a Ketogenic diet?

A fat cell is composed of triglycerides and cholesterol. You are losing weight, you are losing fat, and as you do that the fat cell breaks down. You can burn the triglycerides part of the fat for fuel, but not cholesterol. Cholesterol will be eliminated. So this spike in cholesterol is temporary and will go down.

If you are concerned about your cholesterol or LDL, you may want to request an advanced lipid panel which measures the particle size.

Continue to consume large amounts of veggies to help flush your liver and other organs while you’re on a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. Bile salts are also extremely helpful. Bile salts help to regulate excessive amounts of cholesterol so a lack of bile salts can keep your cholesterol high.

## Is A Ketogenic Diet Too Extreme

# Is a Ketogenic Diet too extreme?

That belief comes from two different concepts. One is the sentiment, “Everything in moderation”. The other is, “There’s no good or bad food, just molecules. You just have to balance your foods”.

Let’s take a look at keto. You’ll eat moderate protein, higher fats, and low-carb foods. You need to lower your carbs to 20-50 grams per day. This is what people consider extreme.

But let’s compare keto to the standard American diet! It’s about 350 grams of carbs per day, which has become our new normal. But this is what’s extreme! Our society consumes pounds of sugar each year. Keto only sounds extreme if you don’t understand dietary sugar and blood sugar. When you get your blood glucose tested, you want it to be about 80 mg/dL. That equates to about one teaspoon of sugar in all of your blood. The average person consumes 28-30 teaspoons. That’s extreme!

What I consider extreme is the 4 billion prescriptions handed out each year in the US. The $3.4 trillion we spend on health care each year. And 60 percent of the US population is either pre-diabetic or diabetic. Keto is normal and reasonable and helps people get healthy.

## Should I Reduce Carbs Or Sugar On Keto

# Should I reduce carbs or sugar on Keto?

When you’re doing keto, you want to count net carbs, not total carbs. Net carbs are calculated by taking the total carb count of food then subtracting the fiber content. Although fiber is a carbohydrate it has no effect on insulin. The less fiber the more food will spike your blood sugar thus raising insulin. Always focus on net carbs and keep them between 20 and 50 grams daily, or even fewer if you have a slow metabolism or you want to lose more weight. Don’t even factor in veggies if they’re leafy greens. Avoid tomatoes, carrots, and beets because their carb count is high.

You also need to understand the glycemic index, which indicates how foods affect your blood sugar. Items that have less fiber and more sugar will spike your blood sugar more quickly than foods that are higher in fiber. Fiber buffers the sugar response.

Take a potato as an example. A raw potato has a lot of fiber which lowers its net carb count. But as soon as you fry, bake, or mash it, its sugar count climbs astronomically. Or, for instance, one slice of bread has a net carb count of just over 10 grams or almost half of your desired daily amount. Not only is bread high on the glycemic index but the specific fiber, which is from grains, has phytic acid which depletes certain minerals, especially zinc. And it has gluten, which many people are sensitive to. So I don’t recommend grains or grain fiber. You want to get your fiber from vegetables. And you want to avoid starches like rice.

What about fruit? Well, for example, an apple has a net carb count of just over 20 grams. And it has 19 grams of sugar! Berries are much better because they have more fiber and less sugar, and are lower on the glycemic index. In other words, you have to take fiber, net carbs, and glycemic index into account when you’re considering whether to consume a certain food. Also become aware of something called the insulin index, which states how much a particular food will affect your insulin level.

## Whats The Difference Between Lazy And Dirty Keto

# What's the difference between lazy and dirty keto?

**Lazy keto** - Lazy keto is when you do not count calories or ketones. You primarily focus on counting carbohydrates—and keeping them below 50 grams per day. Lazy keto also involves consuming a moderate amount of protein (roughly 3-8 oz per meal) and consuming high amounts of fat (without focusing on the quality of fat).

**Dirty keto** \- Dirty keto completely ignores the quality of your nutrients. Those who do dirty keto often eat at fast-food restaurants and consume processed cheese and meats. Dirty keto may also include a lot of MSG, low-nutrient foods, non-organic ingredients, high amounts of omega-6 fatty acids, and trans fats. On dirty keto, you might consume a heavily-processed fast-food burger without the bun, which—although keto-friendly—contains a lot of unhealthy ingredients. Overall, the difference between lazy keto and dirty keto is that dirty keto doesn’t focus on the quality of food at all. Those on dirty keto may consume some very unhealthy foods.

## What Lifestyle Changes Can Promote Longevity Improve Health And Reduce Eefbbf

# What lifestyle changes can promote longevity, improve health, and reduce age-related diseases?

If we look at risk factors for heart disease, high LDL increases your risk by 38 percent. But insulin resistance increases your risk by 540 percent.

Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, like diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension, can be caused by insulin resistance. This seems to mean that insulin resistance is the biggest risk factor for premature cardiac death.

The most popular mainstream treatment for high cholesterol is statin drugs. Studies have shown that statins can potentially lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. Healthy mitochondria are essential to longevity. Statins may also impair the mitochondria and increase apoptosis (death of the mitochondria).

An interesting study links higher LDL cholesterol to inversely affecting mortality. This means that having higher LDL may help extend your lifespan. Cholesterol is involved in a myriad of functions in the body—it’s essential for a healthy life.

Blood thinners and even the heart-healthy diet recommended by the American Heart Association can also contribute to insulin resistance and high blood sugar. To live longer, improving insulin resistance, making insulin more sensitive, and stabilizing your blood sugar is crucial.

**The most important things you can do to support healthy insulin and blood sugar include:**

1\. Getting on a low-carb diet (the ketogenic diet)

2\. Doing intermittent fasting

3\. Not restricting cholesterol

4\. Consuming vegetables

5\. Exercising

## What Specific Nutrients Are Known To Support Prostate Health And How D 851952

# What specific nutrients are known to support prostate health, and how do they contribute to the prevention and management of prostate-related conditions?

Dr. Berg emphasizes several nutrients and foods that support prostate health. Here are the key points:

1. **Zinc**:

    - Zinc is crucial for maintaining prostate health. A zinc deficiency is associated with inflammation and enlargement of the prostate gland, as well as an increased risk of prostate cancer.

    - Zinc helps regulate the flow of urine and plays an essential role in the production of male sex hormones, including testosterone.

2. **Cruciferous Vegetables**:

    - Vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts benefit prostate health.

    - These vegetables contain indoles, which help detoxify excess estrogen, promoting hormonal balance.

    - Broccoli, in particular, is noted for its cancer-fighting properties and is especially good for breast and prostate cancer.

3. **Healthy Keto Diet**:

    - A well-structured keto meal plan that includes nutrient-dense foods such as lean meats, fatty fish, leafy greens, and cruciferous vegetables supports hormonal balance by reducing estrogen levels over time.

4. **Saw Palmetto and Nettle Root**:

    - Saw palmetto is used to alleviate urinary symptoms related to an enlarged prostate (BPH).

    - Nettle root exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and aids in improving urine flow among men with BPH.

5. **Avoiding Phytic Acid**:

    - Phytic acid in whole grains and cereals can block zinc absorption. Reducing the intake of these foods can help improve zinc absorption.

These nutrients and dietary recommendations are aimed at supporting prostate health and managing conditions like Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). Always consult a healthcare provider before making significant dietary changes, especially if you have other medical conditions.

## What Are The Health Benefits Of Beets And How Do Their Compounds Contr D48B7D

# What are the health benefits of beets, and how do their compounds contribute to these effects?

Beets are a nutritional powerhouse that deserve a regular spot in your diet. They're not only keto-friendly, but also offer a wealth of health benefits.

**Beets: A Keto-Friendly Superfood**

Contrary to popular belief, beets are perfectly compatible with the keto diet. Their high fiber content balances out the carbs, making them a great choice for those watching their insulin and blood sugar levels. Just remember, beet juice is not keto-friendly due to its lack of fiber.

**Nutritional Benefits**

Beets are low in net carbs and calories, yet packed with essential nutrients. They're an excellent source of vitamin C, vitamin B6, folate, potassium, manganese, and copper. Beets also contain unique betalains, plant chemicals with impressive health-boosting properties.

**Five Reasons to Eat Beets Regularly**

1. **Support Healthy Blood Pressure:** Beets' high nitrate content converts to nitric oxide, a vasodilator that widens blood vessels, improving blood flow and reducing blood pressure. This significantly lowers the risk of stroke and heart disease.

2. **Promote Eye Health:** Beet greens are rich in carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin, which protect your eyes from oxidative damage and safeguard retinal cells from UV light. This promotes retinal health and reduces the risk of age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma.

3. **Support Detoxification:** Beets are a top source of betalains, which promote the release of enzymes needed for detoxification. Betalains also help balance blood lipid levels and may benefit those with fatty liver disease.

4. **Combat Inflammation:** Beets are packed with anti-inflammatory nutrients like betalains, carotenoids, and phytochemicals. This helps reduce chronic inflammation, a major contributor to many diseases like cancer, heart disease, and arthritis.

5. **Lower Cancer Risk:** Beets contain compounds that may lower the risk of several cancers, including prostate, breast, liver, and stomach cancer. Their high folate content also protects DNA from damage, reducing the risk of mutations and cancer development.

**Incorporating Beets into Your Diet**

Beets are a versatile ingredient that you can enjoy in various ways:

- **Raw:** Grate them into salads or slaw for a crunchy, refreshing addition.

- **Pickled:** Pickled beets add a tangy flavor to salads and sandwiches.

- **Roasted:** Roasting enhances their natural sweetness and brings out their earthy flavor.

## What Are The Five Main Causes Of Bloating And What Strategies Can Quic 8489Dd

# What are the five main causes of bloating, and what strategies can quickly alleviate it?

Bloating can be a frustrating and uncomfortable experience. It can be caused by various factors, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact trigger. This post explores different causes of bloating, from dietary changes to issues within your digestive system, and provides insights on how to identify and manage them.

**Understanding Bloating Causes**

- **Recent Dietary Changes:** Consider if bloating coincided with new foods or dietary habits, such as incorporating keto snacks, salads, cruciferous vegetables, dairy products, or sugar alcohols.

- **Stomach Issues:** Inadequate stomach acid or an overly alkaline pH can cause indigestion, acid reflux, and bloating. Consider Betaine Hydrochloride supplements or apple cider vinegar to support stomach acid production.

- **Gallbladder Problems:** A sluggish gallbladder or inadequate bile production can disrupt fat digestion and cause bloating. Gentle massage under the right ribcage and bile salt supplements might help. Consult a healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment.

- **Pancreatic Insufficiency:** Insufficient pancreatic enzymes can lead to diarrhea, floating stools, and bloating. Reduce carbohydrate intake and consider enzyme supplements.

- **Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO):** This condition can cause fermentation in the small intestine, leading to bloating, gas, and stomach pain. A temporary carnivore diet, antibacterial herbs, and fasting might help.

- **Large Intestine Imbalance:** Bloating can result from fermentation in the large intestine. Consuming probiotic-rich foods and increasing vegetable intake can promote microbial diversity and ease discomfort.

- **Stress:** High stress levels can trigger cortisol release, leading to inflammation and bloating. Stress management techniques like spending time outdoors and relaxation exercises can be beneficial.

**Other Bloating Triggers**

- **Overeating**

- **Eating too quickly**

- **Carbonated beverages**

- **Food intolerances (lactose, gluten)**

- **High-fiber foods**

- **Artificial sweeteners**

- **Iron-fortified cereals**

**Key Takeaway**

Understanding the potential causes of bloating and making informed dietary and lifestyle changes can lead to significant relief. Remember, consult a healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies For Supporting Pancreatic Healt B315C9

# What are the most effective strategies for supporting pancreatic health, and how can these methods help prevent pancreatic disorders and maintain overall metabolic well-being?

Dr. Berg recommends several strategies to support a healthy pancreas:

1. **Dietary Adjustments**:

    - **The Healthy® Keto Diet**: This diet encourages a low-carbohydrate lifestyle to manage and potentially reverse insulin resistance, which is crucial for pancreatic health.

    - **Intermittent Fasting**: Incorporating fasting into your routine can improve insulin sensitivity and support pancreatic health.

    - **Avoid Refined Carbohydrates and Sugars**: These are known triggers for insulin resistance, particularly in individuals with a pancreas body type.

2. **Natural Supplements**:

    - **Berberine**: This supplement helps regulate blood sugar levels and supports the cells in your pancreas responsible for insulin production.

    - **Beef Pancreas Extract**: Provides direct support to the pancreas.

    - **Milk Thistle**: Known for improving insulin sensitivity and supporting liver health, which is indirectly beneficial for pancreatic function.

3. **Lifestyle Modifications**:

    - **Regular Exercise**: Including interval training can help maintain healthy growth hormone levels, which are essential for overall endocrine health.

    - **Adequate Sleep**: Ensuring good quality sleep to support overall hormonal balance and reduce stress on the pancreas.

These strategies aim to enhance pancreatic function and overall metabolic health, thereby supporting better blood sugar management and reducing the burden on the pancreas.

## Do I Really Need Carbs For Healthy Living

# Do I really need carbs for healthy living?

All your life you've been told that you need carbohydrates for energy or that your brain can only run on glucose made from carbs, a type of sugar. That is a myth, as evidenced by the countless healthy, happy individuals on low-sugar or low-carbohydrate diets. Instead, you can run your body on other fuel sources, such as fatty acids and ketones produced by fat-burning. While your body does need a very tiny amount of glucose (sugar) to function, it can produce all the glucose it needs internally from fat or protein, not carbs. For more information, watch this video:

## Can Apple Cider Vinegar Acv Help Boost Energy Levels And What Evidence 54939E

# Can apple cider vinegar (ACV) help boost energy levels, and what evidence supports its effectiveness in enhancing vitality and reducing fatigue?

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) has long been used as a natural remedy, and it can also boost your energy levels. Here's how ACV interacts with your body's metabolic processes:

**Acetic Acid as a Source of Fuel**

\- Primary Component: The main component of ACV is acetic acid.

\- Energy Conversion: Your body converts acetic acid into ketones, which are energy molecules that tissues can use directly.

\- Daily Boost: Adding a tablespoon or two of ACV to a glass of water can increase your energy levels throughout the day.

**The Role of Gut Microbes**

\- Gut Health: ACV supports gut health by promoting beneficial bacteria.

\- Fermentation Benefits: These bacteria ferment acetic acid into compounds like butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids.

\- Health Benefits: These compounds help regulate blood sugar, reduce inflammation, and promote colon health, leading to more stable energy levels.

**Incorporating ACV into your routine, such as adding it to water after meals, can help stabilize energy by supporting gut health and blood sugar regulation.**

## Can I Still Eat Ice Cream And Do A Ketogenic Diet

# Can I still eat ice cream and do a Ketogenic diet?

The answer is yes/no. Regular ice cream contains a lot of sugar and carbs which can spike your insulin levels, and it will kick you out of Ketosis. However, there are a lot of Keto version ice creams on the market. You will need to look for ice creams where carb levels are low and in which sugar substitutes are used like erythritol, stevia, etc.

## What Diets Should I Not Follow

# What diets should I not follow?

**7 Diets That Can Harm Your Health and Weight Loss Goals**

Beware of these popular diets that often rely on heavily processed ingredients and can sabotage your health and metabolism:

1. **Junk Food Atkins:** The Atkins brand's shakes and bars are loaded with unhealthy ingredients like soy protein isolate, artificial flavors, and polydextrose.

2. **Jenny Craig:** Pre-made meals and the "anytime bar" contain soy protein isolate and synthetic starches like maltodextrin.

3. **Weightwatchers:** While focused on portion control, their Smart Ones brand includes meals with ultra-processed ingredients like soy protein isolates and soybean oil.

4. **Nutrisystem:** Marketed as diabetic-friendly, it uses ingredients like maltodextrin, which has a high glycemic index.

5. **Ideal Protein:** "Wheat protein isolate" is just another name for starch, a chain of sugars.

6. **Optifast:** This medically supervised program relies heavily on shakes, bars, and soups, often with maltodextrin as a primary ingredient.

7. **Medifast:** Despite being "scientifically designed," their products contain soy protein isolates, polydextrose, and other processed ingredients.

**The Bottom Line:**

These ultra-processed ingredients can disrupt your metabolism and contribute to health issues like diabetes and obesity.

**For sustainable weight loss, focus on whole foods and always read ingredient lists!** Don't be fooled by "keto-friendly" labels – prioritize real, nutritious food

## What Brand Of Melatonin Does Dr. Berg Recommend

# What brand of melatonin does Dr. Berg recommend?

**Melatonin: Beyond Just Sleep** 

While Dr. Berg doesn't have a specific brand recommendation for **melatonin**, it's important to understand that its benefits extend far beyond just being a sleep aid. 

It's true that your body naturally produces melatonin, and you can support these levels through diet and lifestyle. We'll get into those tips shortly. However, I'm not recommending that you take melatonin supplements unless you're using it for a specific condition, as your body is designed to make its own. 

**Surprising Benefits of Melatonin** 

Here are 12 lesser-known but significant benefits of melatonin you should be aware of: 

1. Acts as a **potent antioxidant**. 

2. **Improves the immune system**. 

3. **Reduces inflammation**. 

4. **Decreases headaches**. 

5. Helps **fight against cancer**. 

6. Helps **protect your brain and memory**. 

7. **Decreases Luteinizing Hormone (LH)**, which is linked to Alzheimer's disease. 

8. **Improves GERD symptoms**. 

9. **Lowers anxiety**. 

10. Helps **fight depression**. 

11. **Stabilizes blood sugars**. 

For the therapeutic benefit of lowering Luteinizing Hormone, Dr. Berg suggests a higher dosage: **75 mg for women and 125 mg for men**. 

**How to Naturally Boost Your Melatonin Levels** 

You can significantly improve your body's natural melatonin production through these lifestyle adjustments: 

- **Avoid light at night:** This includes bright overhead lights. 

- **Get plenty of sun and vitamin D during the day:** Exposure to natural light during the day helps regulate your circadian rhythm. 

- **Decrease your exposure to blue light in the evening:** This means limiting screens (phones, tablets, computers, TVs) before bed or using blue light filters. 

- **Avoid eating before bed:** Give your digestive system a break before sleep. 

- **Get your glucose under control:** A low-carb keto diet can be very helpful here. 

- **Avoid TV before bed:** The light and stimulation can interfere with melatonin production.  

**Best Practices for Buying Melatonin Supplements** 

If you do decide to purchase a melatonin supplement for a specific condition, here are some best practices to ensure you're getting a quality product: 

1. **Look for "Pharmaceutical Grade" or "USP Verified":** These designations indicate that the product meets strict quality, purity, and potency standards. 

2. **Check the Dosage:** Melatonin dosages can range widely. Be sure the product offers the specific dosage you're looking for, especially if you're aiming for higher therapeutic amounts. 

3. **Read the "Other Ingredients":** Opt for products with minimal fillers, artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives. Simpler is often better. 

4. **Reputable Brand:** Choose well-known, transparent brands that are clear about their sourcing and manufacturing processes. 

5. **Third-Party Testing:** Some brands will have their products tested by independent third-party labs to verify purity and accuracy of ingredients. This information is often available on their website or the product label.

## How Do I Know If My Supplement Contains Maltodextrin

# How do I know if my supplement contains maltodextrin?

Iodine mixed with water is a golden color. If you combine iodine with starch, it turns blue. When you add iodine to bread, for example, it turns blue. Or, if you put maltodextrin in water and add a few drops of iodine, the water will turn blue. My brand of electrolyte powder doesn’t have any sugar or maltodextrin in it. However, when we look at a competitor’s electrolyte powder that also claims it doesn’t have sugar or maltodextrin, it turns blue when iodine is added.

Maltodextrin behaves like sugar, spiking insulin, but can be classified on a label as a carb and not a sugar. On the glycemic index, table sugar is at 65, and glucose is at 100—maltodextrin is between 105 and 185. Maltodextrin is the most common starch added to supplements and other products. If there is less than one gram of maltodextrin in a product per serving size, the company doesn’t even have to state it. Maltodextrin can also be found in flavorings, energy gels, sports powders, and even baby formulas. It’s important to be aware that some so-called keto-friendly products can also contain maltodextrin.

## Is Pure Alcohol Keto Friendly

# Is pure alcohol keto-friendly?

You may have heard of keto-friendly wine or that pure alcohol is keto-friendly. Pure alcohol is not a carb or sugar and doesn’t directly increase your blood sugar or insulin. However, indirectly, it can create severe insulin resistance. Liver cells treat alcohol like poison and try to get rid of it. The toxicity of the alcohol injures the liver cells and can even kill them. During this process, you develop fat in the liver cells, which can lead to a fatty liver. With a fatty liver, you can also experience inflammation and scarring in the liver. Chronic inflammation and scarring can then cause cirrhosis and increase your risk of liver cancer and other liver problems. Alcohol also blocks your ability to burn fat. Don’t expect to burn fat for 48 to 72 hours after alcohol consumption. It’s a source of empty calories and depletes important nutrients.

You’ve probably heard that there are certain benefits of drinking alcohol in moderation. But, recently, they’ve found that was only a marketing tactic, and there are no benefits to drinking alcohol.

## Is It A Good Idea To Add Cheat Days Into My Diet Plan

# Is it a good idea to add cheat days into my diet plan?

Some weight loss plans have cheat days built into the program. But this isn’t a good idea because it can severely affect your results. Once you go off of a diet plan, it’s really hard to get back on it. That said, sometimes it can be encouraging to go off keto just to see how much better you feel when you’re on keto and doing it correctly.

The goal is to create enough health and discipline that you can go off of the keto plan very temporarily and then go right back on. The best way to tell if someone is cheating on keto or staying healthy is to look at their A1C. An A1C test measures how much glucose is stuck to the protein in your blood. The more sugar in your body, the higher percentage of your hemoglobin is affected by glucose. You would want your A1C percentage to be below 5.7.

The best way to know that the keto program is working and you’re in ketosis is a loss of appetite. But, all it takes is a very small amount of carbohydrates to take you out of ketosis for a couple of days—even half a glass of wine will have this effect. This means a cheat day will knock you out of the program for a good amount of time. If someone is cheating every other day or every third day, they're not going to make very good progress.

## How Does Big Pharma Profit Off Of Sick People

# How does Big Pharma profit off of sick people?

There are over 100 clinical trials supporting that type 2 diabetes can be reversed in as little as 10 weeks. Hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and other chronic diseases can potentially also be reversed with dietary changes. The reversal rate of type 2 diabetes with the standard of care from doctors is 0.1%. In clinical trials with patients following a keto diet, the reversal rate is more than 50%!

Insulin manufacturers and other drug companies primarily fund the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association, so they are subject to direct conflicts of interest. Doctors have been taught to recommend low-fat diets, and there are countless baseless claims that keto is dangerous.

Dietary guidelines significantly influence most Americans. By law, all federal food programs are required to follow these guidelines. Health professionals also use them as the gold standard in nutrition. However, many conflicts of interest are involved in these guidelines, including ties to both Big Food and Big Pharma.

Giving accurate dietary guidelines to the American public is the best way to combat chronic disease.

To get into a healthy state of ketosis, you should eat eggs, dairy, meat, shellfish, vegetables, and low-sugar fruits. Carbohydrates trigger hunger. Without glucose, your body can access your fat stores for energy between meals.

## Is There A Better Option For Ozempic

# Is there a better option for Ozempic?

Visceral fat surrounds the organs and keeps your body in a state of inflammation, preventing fat loss. Avoid these 6 foods that prevent fat loss.

1\. Low-fat yogurt

Low-fat yogurt is typically high in sugar and often contains industrial food starches like modified food starch, modified corn starch, or maltodextrin. Starch is not sweet, so people consume much more than sugar. It’s higher on the glycemic index than sugar and is used to add bulk to a product.

2\. Processed meat

Hot dogs contain industrial sugars such as corn syrup that will spike blood sugar. Adding sugar to meat creates advanced glycated proteins. Organic grass-fed beef hot dogs are a good option!

3\. Atkins products

These products are marketed as low-carb and keto-friendly but contain very low-quality ingredients such as soy protein isolates, seed oils, GMOs, and synthetic fibers. These can cause bloating and diarrhea and also prevent fat loss.

4\. Juice

Many products marketed as “juice” often only contain minimal amounts of fruit juice and have high amounts of sweeteners, such as high-fructose corn syrup. Juice from concentrate is devoid of nutrients. Fructose found in fruit juice can only be broken down by the liver, which can contribute more to a fatty liver than glucose.

5\. Agave nectar

This sweetener seems healthy but is very high in fructose, which is hard on the liver. Coconut sugar and honey are better options but should be avoided when focusing on fat loss.

6\. Mayonnaise

Processed mayo is mainly composed of soy oil. This type of fat is stored in the fat cells and isn’t burned by the body as quickly as saturated fat. Seed oils like soy oil may be at the root of chronic disease.

## What Are The Best Foods To Cleanse And Detox Your Liver

# What are the best foods to cleanse and detox your liver?

These nutrient-rich liver foods aid in liver detoxification and create a vacuum effect, helping you lose weight from the midsection. To make these natural liver detox smoothies, combine the ingredients with one cup of water and one cup of ice.

If you are following a strict keto diet, you may want to stick to recipes without pomegranate or papaya. If you have been doing keto for some time and feel your body can handle a small amount of these fruits—please give all of the recipes a try! Always get organic fruit when possible, and try to keep your net carbs under 50g per day.

1\. Spinach and kiwi Blend 1 cup of spinach with 2 to 3 kiwis.

Spinach supports healthy blood sugar and can also help remove fat from the abdomen, while kiwi has properties to protect the liver against damage.

2\. Spinach and grapefruit Combine 1 cup of spinach with 1 grapefruit.

Grapefruit increases your sensitivity to insulin and increases bile flow.

3\. Kale and pomegranate

Cruciferous vegetables like kale aid in liver detoxification and have anti-inflammatory properties. Pomegranate also decreases inflammation and prevents fat from accumulating in the liver.

4\. Papaya Combine one whole chopped papaya with water and ice.

Papaya is loaded with enzymes that can help digestion and decrease inflammation in the liver.

5\. Celery and blueberries Combine 1 cup of chopped celery with 1 cup of blueberries.

Celery Increases bile production and reduces liver inflammation. Blueberries reduce liver fat, and their polyphenols help remove excess iron from the body.

6\. Cucumber and lemon Combine 1 cup of each of these ingredients.

Cucumber is hydrating and has electrolytes. It increases liver detoxification and can help prevent NAFLD. Lemon can also improve liver detoxification.

7\. Avocado and strawberries

Combine 1 cup of each! Avocado contains glutathione, one of the most potent antioxidants, and also has reparative properties for the liver. Strawberries help increase overall liver function and metabolism and remove fat from the liver.

8\. Coconut and papaya

Coconut contains lauric acid, which is beneficial for the immune system. It contains MCT fat, which turns into ketones. This combination decreases inflammation and scarring on the liver.

## How Breakfast Affects Your Day

# How breakfast affects your day?

What you eat for breakfast affects your ability to focus, your creative ability to solve problems, and how well you sleep at night. A carb-heavy breakfast promotes insulin resistance, which inhibits your ability to absorb fuel. The first place you’ll notice this is in your brain.

Ketones are a much better fuel for your brain than sugar. To make ketones, you need to lower your carbs and sugar. You can also produce ketones by fasting. While fasting, your body must convert to making ketones for energy. Carbohydrate breakfast foods leave you hungry within an hour-and-a-half of eating. Sugary cereal is a poor choice for breakfast. Magic Spoon or keto-friendly granola without added sugar is a better option.

Oatmeal is generally one of the most ultra-processed foods. If you want to eat oatmeal for breakfast, look for regular oatmeal without sugar. The best option for oatmeal is steel-cut oats, although they take longer to cook. Oatmeal and wheat are heavily sprayed with glyphosate, which has been shown to cause cancer and problems with your gut. Choose organic to avoid this problem.

Replacing your breakfast food with protein such as meat, bacon, and eggs can significantly change your energy levels and cognitive function. Eggs and bacon are the perfect healthy morning breakfast. You can also add avocado or cheese. Cheese is very nutritious, a good source of protein, and has good bacteria due to the fermentation process. Yogurt is a great breakfast option. Choose organic Greek or Bulgarian yogurt without added sugar, or make your own yogurt. Instead of giving your kids Wonder bread, try a sprouted bread like Ezekiel bread. Add peanut butter for extra protein. Red meat and pork sausage are also great breakfast foods.

It’s important to prioritize sleep! Losing just one hour of sleep can significantly affect your blood sugar and cognitive state.

## How Can I Remove Skin Tags And Warts Overnight

# How can I remove skin tags and warts overnight?

High insulin can increase one's susceptibility to skin tags. People with diabetes, overweight people, and women with PCOS are at a higher risk of developing them. When you produce too much insulin over a period of time, you can develop insulin resistance. Too much insulin is caused by eating too many carbs or frequent eating. Insulin resistance makes it difficult to absorb glucose. Over time, this deprives your brain cells of fuel, leading to memory problems, concentration problems, and early dementia.

**The solution** is to give your body an alternative fuel source, such as ketones, fatty acids, and protein. To do this, lower your carbs and do intermittent fasting. This will lower insulin and prevent growths like skin tags and warts.

A virus that comes out of remission can create warts if your immune system is compromised. Sufficient vitamin D can support the immune system and put these viruses back in remission. Take 10,000 IU of vitamin D daily, especially in winter.

**Povidone iodine** is an excellent remedy for skin tags. It has potent antiviral and antimicrobial properties, so it’s also good for warts. Iodine dissolves the protein in the skin tag and acts as a dehydrator.

**Garlic** contains allicin, a powerful antiviral compound effective against warts. Because it’s often difficult to differentiate between warts and skin tags, add garlic to ensure your remedy is effective.

**Crush one clove of garlic** and combine one drop of garlic with one drop of iodine. Apply the mixture to your wart or skin tag and cover it with a band-aid. Repeat this every day until your skin tag or wart is gone.

## This Ruins Your Health

# THIS Ruins Your Health!

Big Pharma and Big Food both contribute to this health crisis. Chronic disease primarily comes from a diet composed of ultra-processed foods. Doctors prescribe medications to treat symptoms that come from the junk food diet, rather than addressing the diet. Junk food is not food! It’s composed of refined sugars, seed oils, and starches along with colorings, flavorings, and preservatives. Junk food does not sustain life and it’s at the root of chronic disease.

Some people claim that the ketogenic diet is dangerous, but this is untrue. The keto diet involves the breakdown of fat into ketones as an alternative fuel. When you reduce your carb intake, it forces your body to use your fat reserve for fuel. Keto is great for weight loss and can help combat insulin resistance. When cigarettes lost popularity due to health concerns, tobacco companies bought up the junk food industry. These companies produced profitable food junk food made from dent corn and other cheap materials. A high-carb diet has become normalized for major profits.

RFK Jr. is a non-politician who may be able to sever the relationships between the food industry and the government. Food guidelines are of the utmost importance because the consequences trickle down to the schools, hospitals, assisted living homes, and other places that feed the most vulnerable. More doctors are beginning to consider food and the whole body when managing disease, moving away from the symptom management model.

It's important not to overlook the function and importance of vitamin D, turmeric, magnesium, and grass-fed red meat. Focusing on disease prevention by building health rather than treating disease is most effective. Eating real food is the most important thing you can do for your health.

## Whats The Best Meal To Clean Arteries And Keep Them Plaque Free

# What's the best meal to clean arteries and keep them plaque-free?

The endothelial layer is the innermost layer of your arteries. It controls blood pressure, acts as a filter, prevents clots, and supports immune function. The inside of your arteries is very susceptible to problems with insulin. Most people have insulin resistance, which is caused by chronic carbohydrate consumption and constant snacking.

Nitric oxide relaxes the blood vessels and is vital for the health of the endothelial layer of the arteries. Vitamin D triggers nitric oxide, which is why many people who are low in vitamin D also have high blood pressure. Arginine, testosterone, and magnesium also trigger nitric oxide.

Vitamin D and magnesium can help prevent calcium from building up in the arteries, and vitamin K2 also helps to prevent calcium buildup.

Foods like whole grains and seed oils are deemed “heart healthy,” but they spike insulin. We’re also told to avoid saturated fats because of the cholesterol content. There’s a lot of false information regarding a diet that’s truly healthy for your heart.

The best meal to clean your arteries would involve foods that don’t spike insulin. A low-carb ketogenic diet is best for your heart. The primary part of the best meal to clean out your arteries should be grass-fed red meat. If you’re having a burger, melt raw cheese on top because it’s high in vitamin K2. Red meat is loaded with zinc, which can directly improve your testosterone. Include a salad with your meal. Arugula is a great addition to any salad, as it can increase nitric oxide and is rich in vitamins C and E. Pumpkin seeds are also beneficial due to their high magnesium, zinc, and selenium content. Vitamin D3 is vital for a healthy heart. Sunlight is the best source, but you may need to take a supplement in the winter. Take at least 10,000 IU daily as a maintenance dose.

## How To Stop Frequent Night Time Urination

# How to stop frequent night time urination?

Frequent urination is often blamed on an enlarged prostate, UTIs, or kidney stones, but there’s a much more common root cause.

The most common cause of frequent urination at night is too much insulin in your blood. Insulin resistance is a condition where your insulin receptors no longer accept insulin. To compensate, the pancreas produces more insulin. This is why many diabetics have a problem with urinary frequency at night.

When blood sugar is high, the kidneys remove the sugar from the blood to eliminate it from the body. This increases urination frequency. Insulin resistance causes an overactive bladder, even if your blood sugar is normal. Increased urinary frequency at night is an early sign of insulin resistance, which is a precursor to diabetes. Insulin resistance increases stress on the kidneys, which is why diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease. Insulin resistance can also cause electrolyte imbalances, blood pressure changes at night, and increased cortisol.

Snacking at night is the single most significant cause of frequent urination at night. Eliminate all snacks and beverages after dinner to decrease urination frequency at night. Snacking at night can also cause bloating and interrupted sleep.

A low-salt diet can also increase urination frequency at night. If you think your nocturia is due to low salt, add more sea salt to your meals throughout the day.

A low-carb diet can help reduce nocturia symptoms. Keep your carb consumption under 30 grams per day. Healthy Keto® can combat insulin resistance, improve your health, and reduce frequent urination at night.

Intermittent fasting is equally important in reversing insulin resistance. Aim for 3 meals with no snacks, eventually dropping down to 2 meals each day. Ending nocturia will significantly enhance your sleep, which is vital for your heart, blood sugar, stress levels, energy, cognitive function, and more. Don’t forget to get plenty of vitamin D with magnesium.

## Why Is It Advisable To Avoid Consuming Sugar

# Why is it advisable to avoid consuming sugar?

**Breaking Free from Sugar's Grip**

It's shocking but true: the average person consumes a whopping 74 teaspoons of sugar daily! With over 200 different names and hidden forms, it's easy to unknowingly overdo it.

Sugar's addictive nature is no joke. Food addiction expert Dr. Joan Ifland explains that sugar triggers a dopamine rush in the brain, leading to a temporary high followed by a crash. Over time, this cycle desensitizes your dopamine receptors, requiring more and more sugar to get the same effect.

The good news is you can break free! By shifting your body into a fat-burning state called ketosis, you can eliminate sugar cravings in as little as 72 hours.

**How to Kick the Sugar Habit and Enter Ketosis:**

- **Limit Carbs:** Keep your daily carb intake below 30 grams. This encourages your body to burn fat for fuel instead of sugar.

- **Change Your Environment:** Remove temptations! Clear your home of sugary snacks and enlist the support of your friends and family.

- **Find Healthy Alternatives:** Sugar isn't the only way to feel good. Boost your mood with exercise, dancing, music, laughter, nature walks, helping others, or even engaging in physical work. These activities increase endorphins and oxytocin without the dopamine crash.

Remember, setbacks happen. If you slip up and indulge in sugar, don't get discouraged. Learn from it and get back on track. Minimize the damage by consuming protein and healthy fats to stabilize your blood sugar.

You have the power to overcome sugar addiction and reclaim your health. By making these changes, you'll not only feel better but also pave the way for a happier, healthier life.

## How Can I End Seizures

# How can I end seizures?

**Common triggers of seizures:**

• Fever

• Head injury

• Brain infection

• Choking

• Alcohol

• Drug withdrawal

• Extremely low blood sugar

• Drugs

• Toxins

• Stress

• High blood pressure

Data shows that keto is effective in eliminating seizures by a factor of 50 to 70 percent. But it's important to be on the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. The keto diet for epilepsy also includes more fat than protein. Ketones are a byproduct of fat. Fat and ketones are the primary fuel source that our bodies should run on—not glucose. It's also the preferred fuel source of the brain.

**Top potential benefits of ketones for seizures:**

• They have anticonvulsant properties

• They stabilize the excitability of the neurons

• They modulate neurotransmitters

• They support the brain, including the hippocampus

• They increase the hippocampus's mitochondrial biogenesis

• They protect the brain and neurons against oxidative stress

• They increase the ATP in the neurons to allow them to function better

## What Strategies Can Help Address The Hardening Of Heart Walls Includin 3C94Fc

# What strategies can help address the hardening of heart walls, including lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, and medical treatments?

**If anything could actually extend the longevity of your heart it's the combination of keto and intermittent fasting and doing it healthily. The heart muscle and the inside of the arteries of your heart respond best to vitamin E.** So you should get something called tocotrienols which will immediately help any type of inflammation going on in those areas of your body. Your heart also will carry more oxygen, the heart muscle itself if it has enough vitamin E.

If we're talking about hardening of the arteries, we want to keep things elastic. And with aging, of course, you have more hardening. So there's a couple of things that I would focus on. **First is consuming the high potassium diet on this keto. The potassium and magnesium are going to make your arteries more flexible for sure. And being on a low carb is going to reduce any type of inflammatory condition because it's really all about inflammation that the body then responds as a band-aid and make things really stiff.**

There's some other things you can do to support the heart. Vitamin B3, like niacin with that flush. Also make sure you get enough sleep. And then the one last thing I would recommend is that I wouldn't be afraid of fatty foods. I'd be afraid of carbs because the fatty foods you'll have a lot of vitamin K2 which can help to decalcify the arteries if there is calcium in it.

## What Are The Heart Healthy Fats Found In Olives And How Do They Contri 762B87

# What are the heart-healthy fats found in olives, and how do they contribute to cardiovascular health?

Olives are rich in healthy monounsaturated fats (MUFAs), especially oleic acid, which provides numerous health benefits, particularly for the heart.

**Oleic Acid and Anti-Inflammatory Properties**

Oleic acid, an omega-9 fatty acid, has potent anti-inflammatory effects. It helps combat chronic inflammation, which is linked to diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Research shows oleic acid can suppress cancer-related genes and enhance the effectiveness of certain cancer treatments.

**Monounsaturated Fats for Heart Health**

MUFAs in olives help improve cholesterol levels by lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol and increasing HDL (good) cholesterol, reducing heart disease risk. A study in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a diet rich in MUFAs from olive oil significantly reduced heart disease risk.

**Low-Carb Benefits**

Olives are low in carbohydrates, making them an excellent snack for low-carb or ketogenic diets.

## How To Lower Blood Pressure Simply By Cutting Out Sugar

# How to lower blood pressure simply by cutting out sugar?

High blood pressure can significantly affect your health, but understanding its causes and adopting natural solutions can help you manage it effectively.

One major contributor to high blood pressure is sugar. Unlike the common belief that salt is the primary culprit, sugar often plays a more significant role. When you consume sugary foods, your body releases more insulin to manage the spike in blood sugar. This, in turn, activates your sympathetic nervous system, the "fight or flight" response, leading to elevated blood pressure.

Recognizing the symptoms of sympathetic dominance, such as a lump in the throat, cold extremities, rapid heartbeat, anxiety, insomnia, and panic attacks, is crucial for early identification of high blood pressure. By paying attention to these signs, you can take proactive measures to manage your blood pressure naturally.

Cutting out sugar from your diet is a powerful step towards lowering blood pressure. It reduces insulin spikes, prevents unnecessary stress on your cardiovascular system, and improves overall health by aiding weight management, reducing inflammation, and enhancing mental clarity.

The ketogenic diet is another effective tool for blood pressure regulation. By lowering carb intake and increasing healthy fats, it reduces insulin levels and activates the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation and lowering inflammation. Fatty fish, eggs, nuts, seeds, oils like olive oil and coconut oil, and leafy green vegetables are all excellent choices for a keto diet.

In addition to dietary changes, incorporating natural remedies like vitamin D and potassium-rich foods can further support healthy blood pressure levels. Vitamin D, obtained through sunlight, supplements, or specific foods, is crucial for maintaining balanced blood pressure. Potassium-rich foods like bananas, avocados, and dairy products can also help regulate blood pressure.

Remember, a healthy lifestyle encompassing dietary changes, exercise, stress management, and sufficient sleep is key to naturally managing high blood pressure. Consult with your doctor before making any significant changes to your diet or lifestyle, especially if you have underlying health conditions.  

By understanding the impact of sugar and insulin on your body and adopting natural solutions like a keto diet, vitamin D, potassium-rich foods, and lifestyle modifications, you can take charge of your health and effectively manage your blood pressure.

## Why Can A Fatty Liver Slow Your Thyroid   Hypothyroid

# Why Can a Fatty Liver Slow Your Thyroid - Hypothyroid?

Fatty liver disease can be caused by alcoholism, but it can also be caused by a diet rich in sugar and refined carbohydrates, with lots of frequent eating. This causes insulin spikes and can lead to insulin resistance.

These dietary choices lead to inflammation and scar tissue on the liver, eventually leading to a condition known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD).

A large abdomen or gut is one of the most common fatty liver signs, but the best way to identify a fatty liver is through ultrasound.

A fatty liver diminishes your liver function causing your cholesterol to go up, and your bile production to go down. When you don’t have enough bile, you can’t effectively remove cholesterol.

The thyroid gland produces the hormone T4, which is converted to T3 in the liver. A fatty liver causes problems with the thyroid because the liver is unable to convert T4 into T3, the active form of the thyroid hormone.

If you cannot convert enough T4 to T3, you will develop hypothyroidism. When you have a slow thyroid, you build up even more cholesterol. Hypothyroidism also slows down your metabolism and causes weight gain.

Keto and intermittent fasting address the root cause of these issues by improving the symptoms of insulin resistance. You can also increase your intake of cruciferous vegetables and all other vegetables to help reverse a fatty liver over time.

Choline is very efficient at removing fat from the liver, and can be taken as a supplement to support fatty liver disease.

## Does The Brain Only Run On Glucose

# Does the brain only run on glucose?

People often have an idea that your body — especially your brain — can only run on glucose. But that’s not true! You can run your body on ketones, which provide about forty to seventy percent of the energy you need. Of course, the question becomes, what kind of fuel makes up the difference?There will always be a small amount of glucose, but your body can run on fatty acids. Fat turns into ketones and fatty acids.

Your brain is a little different; it can use ketones for seventy percent of its fuel, with the rest coming from lactate or glucose. Where will you get the glucose if you don’t want to eat carbohydrates? Your body makes its own in a process called gluconeogenesis. Your body uses fat and protein to make glucose. Certain amino acids in protein turn into glucose, as does a component of fat which breaks down into glycerol, then converts to glucose. Your body can easily get the glucose it needs from fat and protein. You don’t need carbohydrates to supply glucose.

## Do Zero Sugar Foods Really Have No Sugar

# Do zero sugar foods really have no sugar?

Despite recent denials by doctors and organizations like the Sugar Association, there is growing evidence that excessive sugar consumption poses serious health risks, particularly for the cardiovascular system. This mirrors the tactics used by tobacco companies in the past to downplay the dangers of cigarettes.

The average person consumes 23 teaspoons of sugar daily, but this number doesn't account for hidden sugars lurking in many processed foods. Even products claiming to be sugar-free often contain starches, which can spike blood sugar even higher than sugar itself.

Highly processed starches like maltodextrin and modified food starch are not the same as natural starches found in potatoes or rice. They can wreak havoc on blood sugar levels and overall health. When these hidden starches are factored in, the average daily sugar consumption skyrockets to 75 teaspoons!

High-sugar diets deplete nutrient stores and cause oxidative damage, leading to chronic conditions like diabetes, Alzheimer's, inflammation, and skin problems. While processed foods are often fortified with synthetic vitamins, they are no substitute for whole, nutrient-dense foods.

Eliminating sugar and starch from your diet can break this cycle of disease, reverse fatty liver, lower blood sugar, and even promote ketosis, a state where your body burns fat for fuel instead of glucose. Ketones are a superior energy source for the heart compared to glucose.

## Does Drinking Alcohol Kick You Out Of Ketosis

# Does drinking alcohol kick you out of Ketosis?

Yes, drinking alcohol can kick you out of ketosis. Your body perceives ethanol as a poison, and your liver prioritizes alcohol detoxification which stops your metabolism from converting fatty acids into ketones. And, what’s more, alcohol can trigger powerful carb cravings, and you may find it hard to resist enticing carb-rich foods while under the influence.

## Whats Better To Consume On Keto Berries Or Fruits

# What's better to consume on Keto, berries or fruits?

Fruits are generally higher in sugar and lower in fiber than vegetables. However, berries offer a unique advantage: they have less sugar and a lower glycemic load. This means they're packed with fiber and phytonutrients that help manage blood sugar spikes.

Here's a quick comparison:

- **Blackberries (¾ cup):** 4g carbs (best choice!)

- **Raspberries (¾ cup):** Slightly higher in carbs

- **Strawberries (¾ cup):** Higher in carbs than blackberries and raspberries

- **Blueberries (¾ cup):** 12g carbs (still a decent option)

Compare this to other fruits:

- **Apple:** 25g carbs, 19g sugar

- **Peach:** 13g sugar, 12g carbs

- **Banana:** 27g carbs, 14g sugar

- **Grapes:** 16g carbs, 15g sugar

Clearly, berries are a much better choice for a ketogenic diet. Remember, the goal with keto is to keep carbs low while minimizing blood sugar spikes, also known as the glycemic index and glycemic load.

## What Causes Hives And Itchiness Urticaria

# What causes hives and itchiness-urticaria?

**Understanding Itchiness, Hives, and Bile Salts**

Itchiness and hives can sometimes be linked to low bile salt levels. Here's why:

- **Bile's Role in Digestion:** Your liver produces bile, which is stored and concentrated in your gallbladder. When you eat, your gallbladder releases bile into your small intestine. Bile works with enzymes to break down fats and absorb essential vitamins and fatty acids from your food.

- **Bile Release and Stomach Acid:** Adequate stomach acid (a specific pH level) is needed to trigger bile release.

**Conditions Linked to Itchiness, Hives, and Low Bile Salts:**

- **Acid Reflux and GERD:** These digestive issues can interfere with proper bile release.

- **Gallbladder Removal:** Without a gallbladder to store bile, its release could be disrupted.

- **Liver Dysfunction:** Liver problems can impair bile production.

- **High Cholesterol and Gallbladder Stones:** These conditions may affect bile flow and function.

**Potential Remedies for Low Bile Salts:**

- **Purified Bile Salts:** Bile Salt Supplements

- **Healthy Ketosis and Intermittent Fasting:** These dietary approaches should be discussed with a healthcare professional to see if they could improve bile production and function.

## What Vitamin Deficiency Mimics Dementia

# What vitamin deficiency mimics dementia?

**Vitamin B12: Vital for Brain Health and Beyond**

Vitamin B12 is crucial for brain function. Deficiency can cause symptoms resembling dementia. Here's what you need to know:

- **Why B12 Matters:** Supports healthy brain cells and nerve function.

- **Where to Find It:** It is primarily found in animal products (meat, fish, dairy), though some microbes also produce it. Vegan and vegetarian diets may increase the risk of deficiency.

- **Low Stomach Acid: A Common Culprit:** Stomach acid (HCL) is needed to absorb B12. Age, antacids, and certain medications (like Metformin) can reduce HCL levels.

- **Boosting Stomach Acid:** Betaine hydrochloride may help normalize acidity.

- **Medication Side Effects:** Dementia-like symptoms can be caused by common medications like antacids, sleep aids, blood pressure drugs, and more.

- **Other Potential Nutrient Deficiencies:** Low levels of vitamin B1 (linked to high sugar/carb intake), zinc, and vitamin D can also mimic dementia symptoms.

**Preventing and Addressing B12 Deficiency**

- **Brain-Boosting Diet:** Emphasize fatty fish, seafood, and red meat while following a healthy keto and intermittent fasting plan. This provides B12 and ketones, which are an alternative fuel for the brain.

- **Supplementation:** Betaine hydrochloride may help if low stomach acid is the cause.

**\*Please keep in mind that the above is not a medical advice. You should see your doctor about any possible medical conditions.**

## Can Following A Ketogenic Diet Lead To High Ldl Cholesterol Levels

# Can following a ketogenic diet lead to high LDL cholesterol levels?

LDL (low-density lipoprotein) serves as a transporter for cholesterol, delivering it where needed, while HDL (high-density lipoprotein) functions as a cholesterol scavenger, returning it to the liver. Cholesterol is essential for bodily functions. On keto, fat cells initially hold onto cholesterol, leading to a temporary spike in LDL. However, over time, stored cholesterol is released and processed. Increased dietary fat on keto can elevate cholesterol levels. LDL comes in two types: Type A (large and harmless) and Type B (small and inflammatory). Keto may promote more Type A LDL. To manage LDL, focus on fiber-rich veggies and moderate fat intake.

## Does My Diet Affect My Knee Pain And Arthritis

# Does my diet affect my knee pain and arthritis?

The foods you eat can have a significant impact on knee pain and arthritis. It all comes down to the balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in your diet.

[Omega-6 fatty acids](https://www.drberg.com/blog/omega-6-fats-and-inflammation) are found in many common foods, such as vegetable oils and processed snacks. While some omega-6 is necessary for health, consuming too much can contribute to inflammation in the body, which can worsen [knee pain](https://www.drberg.com/blog/knee-pain-relief) and arthritis symptoms.

### **The Impact of Omega-6 Fatty Acids on Inflammation**

Omega-6 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat that is essential for various bodily functions. However, when consumed in excess, they can promote inflammation.

In fact, research has shown that a diet high in omega-6 fatty acids can increase the production of pro-inflammatory compounds in the body, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

These compounds can contribute to joint pain, stiffness, and swelling in people with knee arthritis. Some common sources of omega-6 fatty acids include:

- Soybean oil

- Corn oil

- Sunflower oil

- Safflower oil

- Processed snacks and baked goods

- Fried foods

## What Effective Strategies Can I Implement To Alleviate Restless Leg Sy Be1A91

# What effective strategies can I implement to alleviate restless leg syndrome and address the burning sensation in my feet?

That condition sounds to me like something like peripheral neuropathy. So hopefully you're taking Benfotiamine. That's for peripheral neuropathy.And it usually comes with alpha-lipoic acid together. Those are two wonderful things for the nerves. I don't know what your diet looks like, but I hope you get on keto and intermittent fasting because that would ultimately correct it.

This is really a problem with this issue with the depletion of vitamin B1 when you're taking so many carbs. On a rare occasion, it could be coming from an imbalance with magnesium and calcium.

## What Lifestyle Changes Do I Need To Make To Combat Chronic Inflammation

# What lifestyle changes do I need to make to combat chronic inflammation?

## **Lifestyle Changes to Combat Chronic Inflammation**

While chronic inflammation can have serious consequences for your health, the good news is that many lifestyle changes can help reduce inflammation in your body.

These include dietary modifications, regular physical activity, stress reduction, and improved sleep habits.

### **Diet Modifications for Reducing Inflammation**

One of the most effective ways to combat chronic inflammation is through your diet. Certain foods have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, while others can promote inflammation in the body.

Some of the best anti-inflammatory foods to include in your diet are:

- Fatty fish like salmon, sardines, and mackerel, which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids

- Leafy green vegetables like spinach and kale

- Berries, especially blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries

- Nuts and seeds, particularly walnuts and flaxseeds

- Olive oil

- Turmeric, ginger, and other spices with anti-inflammatory properties

On the other hand, there are certain foods that can promote inflammation in the body and should be limited or avoided. These include:

- Refined carbohydrates like white bread, pastries, and sugary snacks

- Fried foods and foods high in trans fats

- Red meat and processed meats like hot dogs and bacon

- Sugar-sweetened beverages like soda and sports drinks

Adopting a low-carb, high-fat diet like the ketogenic diet has also been shown to help reduce inflammation in some people. Additionally, practicing intermittent fasting may have anti-inflammatory benefits by giving your body a break from constant food intake.

### **The Importance of Physical Activity**

Regular physical activity is another key lifestyle factor for reducing chronic inflammation. Exercise has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in the body, partly by reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha.

Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, along with strength training exercises at least twice a week.

Even small amounts of physical activity can help reduce inflammation over time.

![Image](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/video-thumbnails/9bf2d902-4282-456c-8ce8-9260f6d5b5c5.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

### **Reducing Stress and Improving Sleep**

[Chronic stress](https://www.drberg.com/blog/chronic-stress-literally-destroys-immunity) and poor sleep habits can also contribute to inflammation in the body. When you're stressed, your body releases cortisol and other stress hormones that can promote inflammation if they remain elevated for too long.

Similarly, lack of sleep or poor sleep quality can disrupt your body's natural inflammatory response and contribute to chronic inflammation over time.

To help reduce stress and improve sleep, try incorporating some of the following strategies into your daily routine:

- Engage in regular physical activity, which can help reduce stress and improve sleep quality

- Establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine

- Limit exposure to screens and electronic devices before bed

- Create a cool, dark, and quiet sleep environment

In addition to these lifestyle changes, increasing your intake of vitamin D3 through sunlight exposure or supplementation may also help reduce inflammation in the body.

Vitamin D3 has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and may help regulate the immune system.

Finally, avoiding excessive intake of omega-6 fatty acids, which are found in many processed foods and vegetable oils, may also be beneficial for reducing inflammation.

While some omega-6 fatty acids are essential for health, consuming too many of them in relation to omega-3 fatty acids can promote inflammation in the body.

## What Are The Healthy Habits That Will Help Me To Regulate What I Eat

# What are the healthy habits that will help me to regulate what I eat?

**Healthy Habits for Regulating Eating**

**Keto and Intermittent Fasting:** The ketogenic diet emphasizes high-fat, low-carb foods to promote fat burning, while intermittent fasting limits eating to specific time windows. Both approaches can help manage cravings and stabilize eating patterns by reducing insulin spikes and promoting stable blood sugar levels.

**Creating a Supportive Environment:** Establish a healthy eating environment by removing tempting snacks, meal-prepping nutritious options, and surrounding yourself with supportive individuals. These steps can simplify maintaining healthy eating habits.

**Fasting Benefits:** Fasting can enhance self-control, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and boost brain function. While not suitable for everyone, it can be a powerful tool for regulating eating habits and supporting overall health.

**Food Logging:** Keeping a detailed food journal helps identify eating patterns and triggers, providing insights for making more intentional food choices and improving dietary habits.

## How To Recognize Inflammation In The Eyes

# How to recognize inflammation in the eyes?

## **Recognizing Inflammation and Dryness in Eyes**

This inflammation can manifest as redness, irritation, and a gritty sensation, often accompanied by excessive dryness.

[Chronic inflammation](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-10-root-causes-of-inflammation) and [dry eyes](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-causes-dry-eyes) can stem from nutrient deficiencies, particularly in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, common among individuals with poorly managed blood sugar.

Addressing these deficiencies through diet and supplementation may help alleviate symptoms and support overall eye health.

## **Lifestyle Changes to Protect Your Eyesight**

In addition to dietary modifications, specific lifestyle changes can go a long way toward safeguarding eye health and managing blood sugar levels.

Implementing these strategies can help you take control of your vision and reduce the risk of severe complications down the road.

### **Diet Adjustments for Stable Blood Sugar**

Adopting a diet that promotes stable blood sugar levels is one of the most impactful changes you can make for your eye health and overall well-being.

This typically involves reducing your intake of simple carbohydrates and sugary foods while increasing your consumption of fiber-rich vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.

Focusing on nutrient-dense, low-glycemic foods can help keep your blood sugar levels in check and minimize the damaging effects of high glucose on your eyes.

## What Are The Dietary Habits That Cause Gallstones

# What are the dietary habits that cause gallstones?

## **Dietary Habits Leading to Gallstone Formation**

Regarding gallstones, the food you eat plays a crucial role. Contrary to popular belief, certain dietary habits contribute more to gallstone formation than fat consumption.

Eating too many grains and sugars can cause a spike in insulin, resulting in depleted bile stores and thus raising the possibility of gallstone formation.

### **Impact of Grains on Insulin Levels**

The impact that grains have on our bodies is often underestimated. They are broken down into glucose during digestion, which then causes your blood sugar levels to rise rapidly.

This triggers your pancreas to release insulin - a hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels by facilitating glucose absorption into cells. However, consuming large amounts of grains regularly leads our body into a state known as insulin resistance.

In this condition, our cells become less responsive or resistant to insulin, making them unable to absorb glucose efficiently, causing high blood sugar and elevated insulin levels in the bloodstream.

This chronic elevation in insulin level is harmful to overall health and contributes significantly towards the depletion of bile reserves, thus paving the way for potential gallstone formation.

### **Sugar Consumption and Gallstone Formation**

Sugar consumption is not only linked to numerous health issues but also potentially gallstone formation. While sugar's relationship with gallstones isn't widely discussed, it is equally concerning.

- **Increase in Insulin Levels:** Like grains, excessive intake of sugars, significantly refined ones like white table sugar or high fructose corn syrup, causes rapid spikes in blood glucose, triggering an increased insulin secretion from the pancreas, resulting in higher circulating levels over time. This heightened level depletes bile, making one susceptible to forming stones within the gallbladder.

- **Promotes Weight Gain:** High consumption of sugars, particularly those found within processed foods, often leads to weight gain due to their empty calorie content devoid of any substantial nutrients yet packed full of energy (calories). Being overweight or obese increases the likelihood of developing cholelithiasis (gallstones).

**Tips To Minimize the Risk Of Gallstones Through Diet**

1. Avoid consuming excess carbohydrates straightforward carbs like sugary drinks, sweets, etc. Opt instead for low-carb foods rich in healthy fats to provide a steady energy supply without causing drastic fluctuations in your blood sugar and insulin levels.

2. Maintain a healthy weight through a nutritious low-carb diet like Healthy Keto. Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of cholesterol stones, the most common type of stone seen in patients suffering from this ailment. Losing even a small amount of weight, if overweight or obese, could potentially reduce the chances of getting affected by this painful condition.

## What Are Some Optimal Food Choices For Brain And Eye Health

# What are some optimal food choices for brain and eye health?

## **Navigating Dietary Choices for Optimal Brain and Eye Health**

Navigating dietary choices for optimal brain and eye health involves selecting foods rich in nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins crucial for cognitive function and vision.

By incorporating fatty fish, leafy greens, berries, and nuts into your diet, you can provide essential nutrients that support brain function and protect against age-related eye conditions.

Understanding the impact of dietary choices on brain and eye health can empower individuals to make informed decisions to maintain cognitive sharpness and visual acuity throughout life.

![Selection of ketogenic foods](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/healthy-low-carbs-products-ketogenic-diet-0.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

### **Incorporating Fish into Your Diet**

Diving into a diet abundant with these underwater wonders, like salmon and mackerel, elevates your brainpower and enhances your eyesight. 

Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for constructing brain cell barriers and play a pivotal part in maintaining the health of your retina.

But it's not just about throwing fish onto your plate willy-nilly. Variety is key. Mixing up your fish intake ensures you get both DHA and EPA types of omega-3s - essential for mental clarity and reducing inflammation that could cloud your vision.

To ensure you're hitting the mark with omega-3 intake without breaking the bank or getting bored at dinner time, consider adding flaxseeds or walnuts to salads for an extra crunch of these vital nutrients when seafood isn't on the menu.

### **Vegan Alternatives for Omega-3s**

If you’re navigating a plant-based path but still want those juicy cognitive benefits from omega-3s, don’t fret. Microalgae supplements are a fantastic vegan source of DHA. They directly provide what fish consume to become rich in these fatty acids.

For everyday eating, chia seeds, hemp seeds, and walnuts offer ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), which our bodies can convert into EPA and DHA, albeit less efficiently than consuming them directly from animal sources or algae-based supplements.

So sprinkle some on oatmeal or blend them into smoothies.

## Is There Any Maltodextrin In Keto Foods

# Is there any maltodextrin in Keto foods?

## **The Hidden Truth About Maltodextrin in Keto Foods**

Maltodextrin sneaks into keto-friendly foods, masquerading as an innocent additive. But don't be fooled. With a glycemic index soaring at 110, it's anything but friendly to your ketosis goals, outranking even table sugar on the blood sugar spike meter.

Most troubling is its origin story—often derived from corn or wheat that's been genetically modified (GMO). This means not only are you grappling with potential blood sugar issues, but you're also possibly consuming GMOs and glyphosate residues without realizing it.

If staying in [ketosis](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-know-you-are-in-ketosis) matters to you, reading labels becomes more than a habit; it's your shield against hidden disruptors like maltodextrin. Opt for whole-food ingredients and sidestep this unwelcome guest hiding in your so-called "keto" treats.

## **Dextrose: The Hidden Sugar Impacting Ketosis**

Imagine you're on a keto diet, carefully picking your foods to stay in ketosis. But here's the kicker: some "keto-friendly" products might pull the wool over your eyes with dextrose.

This sweet devil has a glycemic index of 100, which is like inviting sugar to crash your low-carb party uninvited.

[Dextrose](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-a-product-with-dextrose-still-be-keto) sneaks into various foods under the guise of being harmless or even beneficial. Yet, its high glycemic index means it can spike [blood sugar levels](https://www.drberg.com/blog/blood-sugar-levels-high-despite-keto-and-fasting) fast and hard, throwing you out of ketosis quicker than you can say "carbs." Here’s why that matters for keto followers.

This synthetic sugar is often found where you least expect it - from processed meats to salad dressings. The necessity of diligently scrutinizing labels and opting for unadulterated, natural edibles becomes evident due to their ubiquity.

![Image](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/video-thumbnails/88e115dd-2984-4509-85f8-e2cdda94ebcd.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

## **The Deceptive Nature of Maltitol in Keto Products**

Maltitol might seem like a keto dream come true, but it's more of a wolf in sheep's clothing. With a glycemic index ranging from 57 to 70, maltitol isn't as innocent as it appears.

For perspective, pure glucose sits at the top with an index of 100. Maltitol, though seemingly harmless, can still cause a surge in your blood sugar, jeopardizing your state of ketosis.

### **Glucose Content in Maltitol**

Buckle up because here’s where things get tricky: half of maltitol is glucose. Yes, that molecule with a glycemic index score hitting the roof at 100. If staying in ketosis was your goal, maltitol could be secretly sabotaging your efforts without you even realizing it.

## Link Between Diet And Neurological Disorders

# Link Between Diet and Neurological Disorders

## **Link Between Diet and Neurological Disorders**

Diet can have a profound impact on neurological health. Diet has a noticeable impact on neurological conditions, particularly [Alzheimer's](https://www.drberg.com/blog/alzheimers-simplified) and [dementia](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-6-warning-signs-of-dementia).

### **Alzheimer's Disease, Insulin Resistance, and Glucose Starvation**

The brain relies heavily on glucose for energy. However, when insulin resistance occurs due to poor dietary choices like consuming excessive sugar or refined carbs, it can lead to what we call 'glucose starvation' in the nerves.

This starvation scenario, where neurons are deprived of essential fuel, has been linked directly with Alzheimer's disease. So you see how your dinner plate might be affecting your cognitive health.

### **The Connection Between Gluten and Dementia**

Gluten isn't just about avoiding bread for those wanting to lose weight. It may seem harmless, but gluten sensitivity could potentially trigger gut problems that affect more than just digestion.

Studies suggest a correlation between these gluten-triggered gut issues and an increased risk of dementia - surprising, right? While research is ongoing, reducing gluten intake seems sensible for your belly and possibly for protecting against neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia.

## **Wild-Caught Salmon: A Superfood for the Brain**

For optimal brain health, wild-caught salmon should be the food of choice. But why is it considered so beneficial?

![Wild pacific salmon](https://drberg-dam.imgix.net/others/atlantic-salmon.jpg?w=992&auto=compress,format)

### **Nutrient Profile of Wild-Caught Salmon**

The secret lies in its rich nutrient profile. Packed with Omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA and EPA, salmon provides essential building blocks for neurotransmitters - those vital messengers in our brain.

These Omega-3s improve memory, learning capacity, and mood and help lower inflammation and insulin resistance, which are detrimental to our cognitive functions.

Besides these benefits, another advantage of incorporating wild-caught salmon into your diet is its keto-friendly. This means it can provide [ketones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-is-a-ketone) as an alternative fuel source for the brain when you're on a [ketogenic diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/categories/ketogenic-diet) or[practicing intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/categories/intermittent-fasting).

Last but certainly not least is astaxanthin – this pink pigment found abundantly in wild-caught salmon is a powerful antioxidant that shields neurons from damage by free radicals.

## What Supplements Should Individuals Taking Birth Control Pills Conside 325D0B

# What supplements should individuals taking birth control pills consider incorporating into their regimen?

Birth control pills can lead to nutrient depletion and may contribute to issues related to bile production. It’s not always necessary to take additional vitamins while on birth control; instead, consider assessing your overall nutrient status. If you follow a healthy version of the ketogenic diet, you are likely obtaining adequate nutrition.

However, one concern associated with birth control pills is their potential impact on gallbladder function, which can impair the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E, K1, and K2. It may be beneficial to monitor your nutrient levels and consider targeted supplementation if deficiencies are identified.

## Is It Advisable For Those With Gilberts Syndrome To Follow A Ketogenic F41E5B

# Is it advisable for those with Gilbert's syndrome to follow a ketogenic diet and fasting?

When following a ketogenic diet, it's essential to prioritize nutrient-dense, high-quality ingredients, even if you have specific health conditions. Keto primarily involves reducing carbohydrate intake, but this does not inherently guarantee the use of healthy foods. Incorporating intermittent fasting alongside a well-structured ketogenic approach can enhance overall health benefits. In fact, I find it difficult to identify any scenarios where this combination would be contraindicated, even during pregnancy or lactation. However, while keto may be beneficial, intermittent fasting might not be appropriate for all individuals in those situations.

## What Common Mistakes Should Be Avoided When Drinking Water To Ensure O 43A6Ad

# What common mistakes should be avoided when drinking water to ensure optimal hydration and health?

**Myth #1:** Once you feel thirsty, dehydration has already set in Truth: While feeling thirsty is a sign that your body needs more fluids, it does not necessarily mean you are dehydrated. Your body is designed to give you signals when you need more water, so just drink when you feel thirsty.

**Myth #2:** Drink water until your urine is clear Truth: Your urine should be a pale straw color or light yellow. If it's too clear, it means you are overhydrated; if it is too dark, it could indicate a potential health issue with your liver or kidneys.

**Myth #3:** Drink water to feel full and reduce food intake Truth: While replacing sugary drinks with water can help you lose weight, drinking more water does not directly lead to fat loss.

**Myth #4:** Drinking more water will flush out toxins Truth: Most toxins are fat-soluble and are not flushed out by drinking water alone. The body has its own detoxification system, so just focus on staying hydrated instead of trying to "detox" with excessive water intake.

**Myth #5:** Water will prevent dehydration Truth: While it is true that hydration is vital for overall health, simply drinking water will not prevent dehydration. Other factors, such as electrolytes play an important role in preventing dehydration.

**Myth #6:** Drink more water Truth: Drinking massive amounts of water can lead to imbalances in the body. Certain situations will call for more water intake—just don't overdo it. If you're prone to kidney stones, you need at least 2.5 liters of fluid per day

**Myth #7:** Drink water right before you eat Truth: Drinking water before meals is fine, but it may cause discomfort for individuals who experience heartburn or bloating.

**A few more key points to remember:**

• If you're prone to kidney stones, consider adding lemon to your water.

• Add a little bit of baking soda to your water if you experience gout symptoms.

• The keto flu or fatigue experienced by some individuals on a keto diet is often due to not consuming enough electrolytes with their water, specifically salt.

• Proper hydration is vital for kidney health, but drinking more water won't cleanse or "flush out" the kidneys.

## What Can I Do For Shakiness While Fasting

# What can I do for shakiness while fasting?

Shakiness during fasting often results from rapid adjustments in blood sugar levels. To address this, consider gradually easing into fasting rather than making abrupt changes, particularly if you are new to intermittent fasting or ketogenic diets. Allow your body to adapt at its own pace.

Additionally, ensure your carbohydrate intake remains low when you are not fasting. High carb consumption can prolong the adaptation period and exacerbate low blood sugar symptoms. Maintaining a consistent, low-carb diet will help stabilize blood sugar levels and ease the transition.

---

## Can Fasting Mess With A Womans Hormones

# Can fasting mess with a woman’s hormones?

Fasting can actually promote a sense of calm and reduce stress, as it often leads to a state of increased tolerance and serenity. Some concerns arise from the temporary increase in cortisol levels, a counter-regulatory hormone, when blood sugar levels drop due to not eating. However, this is typically not an issue once the body adapts to fasting and enters ketosis, usually within two to three days. At this point, the body efficiently runs on fat as fuel instead of relying solely on blood sugar, stabilizing cortisol levels. The key is to adapt to a ketogenic diet, which helps maintain hormonal balance during fasting.

## What Are Some Scientifically Supported Strategies And Techniques For A E367Fd

# What are some scientifically-supported strategies and techniques for accelerating the process of falling asleep, and how can they enhance sleep onset and overall sleep quality?

**First, let’s take a look at the reasons why you might be having trouble getting to sleep.**

1\. Overtraining or too much exercise causes the sympathetic nervous system to go up, keeping your adrenaline high and preventing sleep.

2\. If your room is too hot, it can interfere with your sleep quality.

3\. High carb consumption and stress deplete vitamin B1. Vitamin B1 is essential for the parasympathetic nervous system, so a deficiency will keep you up at night. Try taking vitamin B1 before bed for better sleep.

4\. Too much caffeine is a common cause of poor sleep.

5\. Poor gut health can inhibit good sleep. Kefir as a probiotic can help!

6\. Insulin resistance inhibits the absorption of tryptophan, a precursor to melatonin. This can interfere with your ability to fall asleep fast.

7\. Some people have trouble sleeping after being on keto or the carnivore diet for a long period of time. This is because their insulin is very low. Try having a cup of berries with your last meal to fix this problem.

8\. Sodium deficiency can cause problems with your sleep. This can be caused by fasting, OMAD (one meal a day), or not adding enough sodium to your diet. Low sodium can cause your sympathetic nervous system to go up which can keep you from sleeping.

If you want to know how to fall asleep instantly, try this simple sleep technique! You’re going to breathe in a way that synchronizes your heartbeat and blood pressure to the rhythm of your breathing. This will help stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, inducing sleep very quickly. Try practicing with a timer first! Breathe in for 5 ½ seconds and breathe out for 5 ½ seconds. This will give you about 5 ½ breaths per minute. When doing this technique, breathe through your nose, and within minutes you will fall asleep.

## Can Adopting A Plant Based Diet Contribute To The Reduction Of Fibroids

# Can adopting a plant-based diet contribute to the reduction of fibroids?

Following a keto diet can be more challenging on a plant-based regimen due to the need for adequate protein and essential nutrients like B12, bioavailable forms of zinc and iron, and retinol (the active form of vitamin A). While it is possible to achieve a vegan keto diet, careful planning is essential to ensure you're obtaining these vital nutrients. I recommend watching my videos on how to effectively implement a vegan-style keto approach, as you may need to incorporate additional nutritional sources to meet your dietary needs.

## What Factors Contribute To High Cholesterol Levels And How Do Lifestyl Aa634A

# What factors contribute to high cholesterol levels, and how do lifestyle choices and genetics play a role?

**Well, probably because you're burning fat and guess what's in your fat cell.You have a portion of it's cholesterol has to come out. What gets rid of the excess cholesterol is the bile salts. So that would be the liver.**

There's all sorts of things that you can improve your cholesterol levels with niacin and bile salts and, you know having a bit more leafy greens, but typically I wouldn't worry about it because, this is the confusing area for most people with cholesterol. They have this idea that this keto will increase my bad cholesterol. So I'm going to avoid it.Well, please, before you avoid it, get all the details. We have tons of videos on this topic. Try to make it simple. There's a couple of different types of LDL. It's not just one LDL.

There's one that's more pathogenic, the one that can be, that can go into the cells. And unless you do like an advanced lipid profile test, you won't be able to pick up the difference. You're just going to look at total LDL. It doesn't tell you what's going on. I mean, even just think about the purpose of LDL, this so-called bad cholesterol. It delivers cholesterol into the tissues. Now don't we need cholesterol for cell membranes to make hormones, to make vitamin D, to make bile.

So unless we have that delivery system, how are we going to do that? So we need LDL. And especially if someone's going through an infection stress or a menopause, their demand for the cholesterol and those hormones are going to be higher. So it's going to go up. Is that a bad thing? No, we just have to look at the whole picture. And so to base cardiovascular risk on this one little biomarker is really, it's kind of like saying, okay, Steve, you're at the number of ashtrays you have in your house puts you at risk for lung cancer because we have this correlation is people that die of lung cancer have a lot of ashtrays in the house. So therefore ashtrays cause lung cancer.

## Does Human Growth Hormone Hgh Help With Tightening Loose Skin And If S 704871

# Does Human Growth Hormone (HGH) help with tightening loose skin, and if so, how does it contribute to skin elasticity and firmness?

**HGH is considered the anti-aging hormone. One of its key functions is anything to do with protein: prevention of muscle mass loss, improvement of the collagen surrounding your joints, and providing a healthy glow to your skin.**

Some people actually get it injected, which I don’t recommend because of the side effects. And it’s expensive, about $1,500 per month. Don’t buy it! Your body makes it in the pituitary gland, and activates it through the liver.

**There are a number of things that will decrease your human growth hormone, including:**

● Stress, with its high levels of cortisol

● Sugar

● High levels of insulin, the result of frequent eating, excessive protein, being diabetic or pre-diabetic

● Overtraining, if you’re exercising too much without enough sleep

● Alcohol

**Now, I’ll explain what increases HGH. They include:**

● Exercise, which can trigger a 400 to 700 percent increase. The key is to do short bursts of high intensity training such as sprints or spin bike intervals.

● Intermittent fasting can increase HGH by up to 1,300 percent in women and 2,000 percent in men. It’s the most potent stimulator of human growth hormone.

● Going on keto, because you decrease insulin

● Getting better quality sleep

● Having a healthy liver. If your liver is fatty or you have cirrhosis, that inhibits the production of HGH.

When you take action to stimulate your own human growth hormone, you can help tighten your sagging skin.

## Is Cantaloupe Juice Beneficial

# Is cantaloupe juice beneficial?

While cantaloupe juice contains valuable nutrients, its high sugar content, especially when juiced, poses concerns. Juicing removes the fiber that helps regulate sugar absorption, leading to a direct intake of fructose, which may not be ideal, particularly for those managing blood sugar levels. I’ve learned from personal experience—once juicing large amounts of carrot juice until noticing a skin color change—that moderation is key. Cleanses involving sugary juices or glucose can prevent full adaptation to ketosis, making fasting more challenging and intensifying cravings. For effective cleansing and fasting, it's crucial to consider the impact of sugar and opt for methods that support metabolic balance.

## What Are The Key Nutritional Benefits Of Fiber And How Does It Contrib 34566A

# What are the key nutritional benefits of fiber, and how does it contribute to overall health and digestive function?

When I’m talking about fiber, I’m talking about vegetable fiber, not grain fibers, like bran, for example. On the healthy keto diet, I believe it’s important that a person consumes a lot of vegetables as a part of the healthy keto lifestyle. But, there are times that a person wouldn’t want to consume large amounts of vegetables, for example, if they have SIBO.

**10 benefits of fiber:**

1\. It has zero effect on insulin

2\. It contains phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals

3\. It binds to bile and helps regulate the amount of bile in the body

4\. It can help feed the microflora

5\. Small-chain fatty acids (blood sugar control and more)

6\. It may help regulate pH

7\. It may help regulate transit time

8\. It may help regulate lipids

9\. It may have anti-cancer effects

10\. It can help buffer the blood sugar response

## What Do I Need To Eat To Lose Belly Fat

# What do I need to eat to lose belly fat?

**Ten foods that help you lose belly fat:**

1\. Eggs

2\. Salmon

3\. Cod liver and cod liver oil

4\. Sauerkraut

5\. Cruciferous vegetables

6\. Hamburger

7\. Avocados

8\. Broccoli sprouts

9\. Asparagus

10\. Nutritional yeast (non-fortified)

**Cortisol is a stress hormone that turns protein into sugar. It causes your liver to make new sugar out of non-carbohydrate sources, such as fat, ketones and protein. If your cortisol is really high, your body will make a lot of sugar. This increase in sugar will elevate insulin, and insulin makes belly fat. Consuming a high-carb diet and sugar, or eating too frequently can also cause your insulin to spike, leading to belly fat.** **You'll typically notice belly fat after the liver is already fatty because a lot of the visceral fat around the organs comes from a spill-off of fat from the liver.**

## What Are Kidney Stones And What Effective Strategies And Treatments Ca 51Ddb4

# What are kidney stones, and what effective strategies and treatments can be employed to eliminate them and prevent their recurrence?

To prevent kidney stones, maintain hydration by drinking 2-3 liters of fluids daily, ideally with electrolytes like potassium citrate. Limit oxalate-rich foods such as almonds and spinach, especially on a ketogenic diet. Increase dietary calcium from sources like cheese to bind oxalates in the gut.

If fat malabsorption is an issue, additional calcium may help reduce oxalate absorption. Supplementing with citrates—like lemon juice or potassium, magnesium, and calcium—can lower oxalate levels. Balance urinary pH by increasing vegetable intake or using potassium citrate, especially for uric acid stones.

Support gut health with probiotics and ensure sufficient magnesium and vitamin D intake. Additionally, consider adding salt and vitamin K2 to help prevent calcification.

## Am I Potentially Consuming An Excessive Amount Of Dietary Fat

# Am I potentially consuming an excessive amount of dietary fat?

Let's just talk about dietary fat. If you were to eat fat, let's say you ate so much fat per day, and with that fat you had some carbohydrates, now we're going to just go storage, storage, storage. Because your body's only running on glucose, and you can't tap into that reserve. When you're in keto, now you can actually burn the fat. Now does that mean you can just eat unlimited fat and it's all going to get burned? No.

Here's various factors. Number one, your age, your metabolism, how much insulin resistance you have, which will determine how much fat you'll have actually being burned. So it's kind of, there's just, it's hard to give you more of an answer than that.

That's just the general concept. But if you do this and you notice, wow, not losing weight, even though you're in ketosis, because those ketones could be coming from dietary fat, it really, probably the best way to determine if it's being stored is if you're gaining weight, which is going to be very unlikely. You just might not be losing as much weight.

So there is a point of like too much fat. So does fat get stored like a carbohydrate would get stored because of a carbohydrate? No. What determines whether it gets stored is two things. One is how much of that fat you're using as energy or not, and then also what's going on with your insulin levels. It really depends on if you're doing carbs with that fat, right? That's really the key. If you keep your carbs really, really low, I mean like if you like, if it's zero and you're doing fat, it's very unlikely you're going to be burning that fats.

A good amount of it will be eliminated through the digestive system as well, but it's not(4:51) just going to be converted over there because the pathway of the metabolism of fat is actually (4:59) very different than glucose.

## Are Heart Healthy Whole Grains Safe To Consume

# Are heart healthy whole grains safe to consume?

The American Association of Cereal Chemists defines whole grains as “any mixture of bran, endosperm, and germ in proportions one would expect to see in an intact grain”.

**There are 3 parts of an intact grain:**

• Bran- outer layer containing fiber, trace minerals, and B-vitamins

• Germ- B vitamins, vitamin E, trace minerals, phytonutrients, healthy fats

• Endosperm- All of the carbohydrates and a few B-vitamins

According to the FDA, all you need is 51% of these three elements to call a product whole grain. This means that the other 49% could be refined grains, sugars, sweeteners, or other additives.

Refined grains are made by removing the bran and the germ, leaving only the endosperm. There aren’t many vitamins in the endosperm, so the grains are typically enriched with synthetic vitamins and iron. Whether something is made from whole grains or refined grains, it’s still very high on the glycemic index and unfit for a ketogenic diet. The American Association of Cereal Chemists expanded their definition of whole grains to include grains that have been ground. When you grind whole grains, the grinding process exposes them to oxygen, which destroys vitamin E, part of the vitamin B complex, and many of the phytonutrients and healthy fats. Ground grains are more susceptible to going rancid when they’re exposed to air and other things like mold, so chemicals are added to the grains to preserve them.

## What Common Mistakes Should Be Avoided When Dealing With Acne To Preve Bcd8Fa

# What common mistakes should be avoided when dealing with acne to prevent worsening the condition and promote clearer skin?

**The biggest mistake you can make when you're trying to get rid of your acne is trying to wash the acne off of your face.** Blackheads and acne are not dirt that you can simply wash off. When you use detergents, cleansers, alcohol wipes, antibacterial creams, you are literally destroying your microbiome on the surface of your skin.

Your skin contains millions of microbes that act as a barrier, which is involved in your immune system. When you remove that layer of good bacteria, you lose the bacterial diversity. In turn, this increases the inflammation on the skin—it can even cause acne.

This is also why one of the side effects of antibiotics is acne. Acne involves the sebaceous glands. These glands secrete an oil called sebum. Acne is essentially inflammation of these glands with excess amounts of sebum as well as pus and bacteria formation.

**Acne comes from high levels of androgens, which are hormones.** Your androgen levels spike when you're a teenager. In turn, this causes a problem with your sebaceous glands. What causes excess levels of androgens? Insulin. High levels of insulin can throw off your hormone balance. The cause of high insulin is a high-carb diet.

**If you cut the carbs out, the acne will go away. The healthy keto diet and intermittent fasting are the two best ways to promote healthy insulin levels. Try going keto, and let me know how that works for you in the comments below.**

## What Strategies Can Effectively Remove Kidney Stones And Excess Oxalat A859A6

# What strategies can effectively remove kidney stones and excess oxalates to improve kidney function and health?

**Signs your oxalate levels are high:**

• Kidney stones

• Gout

• Headaches

• Eye pain

• Urinary pain

• Genital pain

• Muscle pain

• Intestinal pain

**Foods high in oxalates:**

• Almonds

• Peanuts

• Spinach

• Chocolate

• Kiwi

• Strawberries

• Beets

• Tea

• Bran

Dietary oxalates aren’t correlated with oxalates in your urine. Just because you consume foods high in oxalates doesn’t mean you will develop any problems. But, preexisting damage to your kidneys, liver, or metabolism can cause you to be unable to process oxalates like you should. Diabetes, prediabetes, insulin resistance, and carb consumption can lead to kidney problems. A lack of certain microbes can also prevent you from breaking down oxalates, causing them to end up in the kidneys. Many people who go on the ketogenic diet no longer have a problem dealing with oxalates. But if you’re still experiencing issues, you can try these tips.

**What to do if you have high oxalate levels or are prone to kidney stones:**

1\. Limit foods high in oxalates or consume them with cheese

2\. Take a probiotic with a mixture of lactobacillus

3\. Maintain higher levels of magnesium and citrates (by consuming magnesium and lemon)

4\. Get plenty of vitamin D

5\. Drink at least two and a half liters of fluid a day

## What Are The Health Benefits Of Avocados

# What are the health benefits of avocados?

**Avocado: A Nutritional Powerhouse**

Avocados pack a serious nutritional punch. Here's what you get in an average avocado:

- **Potassium Power:** 500-800 mg of potassium for energy, healthy blood sugar, and a happy heart. It's also a natural relaxant, potentially aiding sleep and blood pressure.

- **Essential Vitamins:** Folate, vitamin C, vitamin K, B vitamins, vitamin E, and more!

- **Fat-Soluble Boost:** Avocados are rich in fat-soluble vitamins, which help your body absorb other nutrients.

**Keto-Friendly Goodness**

- **Low Net Carbs:** Just 2g net carbs per cup fit within a keto diet.

- **Healthy Fats:** About 77% of an avocado is fat, primarily the heart-healthy monounsaturated kind.

**Fiber-Rich for Gut Health**

- **Insoluble Fiber:** Avocados are 75% insoluble fiber, speeding up digestion (but go easy, too much can cause issues!). This fiber is also a feast for those beneficial gut bacteria.

**Plant Power: Phytonutrients**

- **Anti-Everything:** Enjoy anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antimicrobial benefits.

- **Blood Sugar Support:** Certain phytonutrients may help manage blood sugar levels.

- **Types:** Avocados boast fat-soluble carotenoids and phytosterols.

## What Are The Key Benefits Of Vitamin B5 Pantothenic Acid For Energy Me 486934

# What are the key benefits of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) for energy metabolism, skin health, and hormone production?

The name of the B5 vitamin is pantothenic acid and it is a cofactor of energy metabolism, specifically for the enzymes that help you break down fat. When you are converting from sugar- burning to ketosis by burning fat, you need vitamin B5 big-time.

The Greek word for this vitamin is “Pantothen” which means “from all quarters” indicating that it is very easy to get from all your foods. When you read about this vitamin you are going to find that it is almost impossible to be deficient in it, because it is everywhere, but actually a lot of people are deficient in it.

B5 allows macronutrients (fats, carbs, protein) to be converted to energy.

**Benefits**

- Vitamin B5 is needed to support enzymes for energy metabolism from carbs, protein and especially fat

- Supports during keto adaptation

- Supports the production of melatonin (sleep hormone)

- Supports the production of acetylcholine (to help you feel awake during the day)

- Is a key nutrient for adrenal function

- Is needed to make cortisol

**Symptoms of deficiency**

- Stress

- Neuro pain

- Inflammation

- Insomnia

- Keto fatigue

**Where to get it**

Typically, B5 is in our foods, but if your gut flora, the friendly bacteria, are incomplete, there will be fewer B vitamins made. Your gut flora also need vitamin D3 to function and low D3 will lessen the number you have of these microorganisms, which are needed to make B5—leading to a deficiency.

**Best foods for vitamin B5:**

• Mushrooms

• Liver

• Avocados

• Cauliflower

• Eggs

## What Strategies Can Be Employed To Relieve Joint Stiffness During Menopause

# What strategies can be employed to relieve joint stiffness during menopause?

To relieve stiff joints during menopause, consider the following professional advice:

1\. Ketogenic Diet: Adopt a ketogenic diet to reduce inflammation by increasing ketone levels and reducing glucose. Avoid grains and sugars to minimize inflammatory responses.

2\. Oxalate Intake: Be mindful of high-oxalate foods like spinach, chocolate, almonds, and nuts, which can contribute to joint stiffness even on a ketogenic diet.

3\. Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Ensure sufficient intake of omega-3 fatty acids by consuming more fish, sardines, and seafood, which are essential for joint health and reducing inflammation.

These steps can help alleviate joint stiffness and improve overall well-being during menopause.

## How Can I Maintain Weight Loss After Ozempic

# How can I maintain weight loss after Ozempic?

Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of Ozempic is crucial when considering how to manage your weight after stopping this medication.

As a GLP-1 Agonist, Ozempic mimics a hormone in your small intestine that helps regulate insulin levels, control appetite, and slow down gastric emptying. While this can aid in weight loss, it can also lead to adverse side effects.

**These side effects may include:**

• Nutrient deficiency

• Gastroparesis

• Constipation

• Gallbladder problems

• Thyroid tumors and cancer

**To help maintain your weight after Ozempic, it’s crucial to make certain lifestyle changes, such as:**

1\. Follow a ketogenic diet to keep insulin levels low and promote fat-burning.

2\. Do intermittent fasting to control appetite and improve hormone balance.

3\. Incorporate weight training to build and preserve muscle mass.

Additionally, ensuring adequate protein intake is crucial for maintaining muscle mass, especially for those who have already lost a significant amount of muscle while on Ozempic. This can be achieved through consuming bioavailable proteins such as red meat, eggs, and fish. Monitoring your hormone levels and ensuring proper cholesterol intake is also important, as cholesterol is a building block for many hormones, including testosterone and estrogen.

## Is There A Common Keto Ingredient That Stops Keto

# Is there a common Keto ingredient that stops Keto?

Keto is a low-carb diet. Most people know that, on keto, they need to cut out sugar and grains. But, it’s also important to cut out grain oils, or more specifically, seed oils. Many people call grain oils vegetable oils, but they’re really not vegetable oils. They don’t get the oil from vegetables—they get it from the seed of the plant. The problem with grain oil is omega-6 fats. Omega-6 fats are highly inflammatory. They can actually trigger insulin resistance just as much as sugar or refined grains. Grain oils can also get stuck in the body and clog up the liver and brain. Not to mention that many grain oils are GMO.

**Oils and foods higher in omega-6 fats:**

• Soy

• Cottonseed

• Canola

• Corn

• Safflower

• Sunflower

• Almond flour

• Peanut butter

I’m not saying you can’t have some things higher in omega-6 fats like almond flour and peanut butter, but you might want to balance it out by getting omega-3 fats. An average person in America has 15 times more omega-6 than omega-3.

**Top sources (some are keto, some are not)**

1\. Chicken

2\. Grain desserts

3\. Salad dressing

4\. Chips

5\. Nuts/seeds

6\. Pizza

7\. Bread

8\. Fries

9\. Pasta

**The definition of keto is low-carb, and it doesn’t really emphasize the type of fat you should be consuming. I believe healthy keto is the best way to go.**

**Healthier oils:**

• Coconut oil

• Butter

• Olive oil

• Avocado oil

If you’re plateauing on keto, you may be consuming too many grain oils, or you could be using too much almond flour or peanut butter.

**Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids:**

• Fish

• Cod liver oil

• Grass-fed beef and other animal products

• Walnuts

• Chia seed

• Brussels sprouts

**Do not use:**

**• Soy oil**

**• Cottonseed oil**

**• Canola oil**

**• Corn oil**

**Limit:**

• Safflower oil

• Sunflower oil

**Reduce these if you have a problem with inflammation or you’ve hit a plateau:**

• Almond flour

• Peanut butter

## What Strategies And Interventions Are Most Effective For Improving Res 9A4C86

# What strategies and interventions are most effective for improving respiratory function and optimizing breathing efficiency?

There’s something called the respiratory quotient, which is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO2) that happens in your body. Fat has the lowest RQ at .7, meaning you’ll get the lowest amount of CO2 but the most amount of oxygen. This is why a lot of people report that they’re breathing better on the ketogenic diet, even if they have COPD, asthma, or emphysema. Plus, they can go longer when they exercise.

Depending on the amount of ketones in your body, the RQ may even be a little lower; potentially as low as .66 then ranging to .73. Protein has a slightly higher RQ at .8. But check this out: carbs are 1.0, meaning they give off the most amount of C02 and the least amount of oxygen.

Now, that being said, I want to bring up the concept of ketoacidosis.

When your body is in an acidic state, you have a difficult time breathing. More CO2 than oxygen is being produced, but for a different reason than I described earlier in this video. If you're concerned about ketoacidosis, I’ll define what it is.

Not only does the pH drop by a slight degree, but your blood glucose will be very high; on the order of 300 or more. When you’re on the ketogenic diet and you’re not a diabetic, your blood sugars are going to be more like 80, 70, 0r 60. In other words, quite low. You’d have to be a diabetic type 1 for it to be as high as it would be in ketoacidosis.

And this situation of extremely high blood sugar occurs when you have no insulin going on. So you’d have to be a type 1 diabetic, who hadn’t taken their insulin, for your blood glucose to get so out of control. Add in a very high level of ketones plus acidic blood, and the dangerous condition of ketoacidosis will result. So I just want to clear this up because sometimes people are confused and concerned that ketoacidosis is a common risk on keto. It’s not.

Another type of acidosis is lactic acidosis; which, ironically, is a side effect of the diabetes drug metformin. If you experience this, take vitamin B1 and calcium.

To summarize, the keto diet has the benefit of generating less CO2 and more oxygen to help you breathe better.

## What Stops Me From Losing Belly Fat

# What stops me from losing belly fat?

**One of the top things that will stop you from losing belly fat is alcohol consumption. You may have heard of keto-friendly wine or that pure alcohol is keto-friendly. Pure alcohol is not a carb or sugar and doesn’t directly increase your blood sugar or insulin. However, indirectly, it can create severe insulin resistance.**

Liver cells treat alcohol like poison and try to get rid of it. The toxicity of the alcohol injures the liver cells and can even kill them. During this process, you develop fat in the liver cells, which can lead to a fatty liver.

**With a fatty liver, you can also experience inflammation and scarring in the liver.** Chronic inflammation and scarring can then cause cirrhosis and increase your risk of liver cancer and other liver problems. Alcohol also blocks your ability to burn fat. Don’t expect to burn fat for 48 to 72 hours after alcohol consumption. It’s a source of empty calories and depletes important nutrients.

You’ve probably heard that there are certain benefits of drinking alcohol in moderation. But, recently, they’ve found that was only a marketing tactic, and there are no benefits to drinking alcohol.

**Alcohol also has negative effects on other parts of the body, including:**

• The brain

• The endocrine system

• The gut microbiome

• The heart

• Estrogen production in men (increases estrogen and decreases testosterone)

It’s crucial to realize the negative effects of alcohol and consider the real reasons you’re drinking alcohol, like stress. Many natural things can help you reduce stress. If you can’t give up alcohol, try diluting it with sparkling water. If you take milk thistle before drinking, it can help protect the liver against poison and can help support the liver. Kombucha tea with low amounts of sugar is also a great alternative to alcohol and gives you a nice, relaxed feeling.

## What Common Factors Or Habits Might Be Preventing My Metabolism From I E3231F

# What common factors or habits might be preventing my metabolism from increasing?

Here are the top mistakes dieters make:

1\. Misunderstanding Metabolism: Trying to boost metabolism can lead to burnout. A slower metabolism often reflects efficiency rather than dysfunction.

2\. Low-Calorie Diets: Long-term low-calorie diets can hinder metabolism and lead to weight regain.

3\. Frequent Eating: Eating frequently can spike insulin levels, hindering fat burning. Opt for quality over quantity in meals.

4\. Overtraining: Excessive exercise without adequate recovery prevents effective fat burning.

5\. Processed Protein Shakes: Low-quality protein shakes high in refined ingredients and insulin-raising factors can hinder weight loss. Opt for high-quality animal proteins instead.

Focus on improving overall health to facilitate sustainable weight loss, including adopting a ketogenic diet to shift to fat metabolism and incorporating high-intensity interval training with adequate recovery, while managing stress and prioritizing sleep.

## What Strategies Can Be Employed To Naturally Boost Growth Hormone Leve 386175

# What strategies can be employed to naturally boost growth hormone levels as you age?

In adults, growth hormone is essential for muscle building, fat burning, and overall health, including joints and bones. Aging leads to declining levels, affecting muscle, cognition, mood, and metabolic health.

Factors hindering growth hormone include insomnia, sleep apnea, high blood sugar, insulin, chronic stress, and liver issues. Rather than synthetic replacements, supporting natural production through methods like intense exercise, milk thistle for liver support, a Healthy Keto® diet, and intermittent fasting is recommended.

For ketogenic dieters experiencing muscle dehydration, adequate electrolyte-rich hydration and adjusting carb intake to around 50 grams per day from sources like berries can help maintain muscle health without refined carbs and sugars.

## What Are The Primary Causes Of Chronic Inflammation And How Do Factors 930824

# What are the primary causes of chronic inflammation, and how do factors such as lifestyle, autoimmune disorders, and environmental triggers contribute to its development?

Inflammation is a vital immune response but can become chronic due to various factors:

1\. **Vitamin D Deficiency:**

\- **Cause:** Linked to chronic inflammation and autoimmune conditions.

\- **Remedies:** Sunlight exposure, vitamin D supplements, and vitamin K2 for calcium balance.

2\. **Allergies:**

\- **Cause:** Triggered by food or environmental allergens, leading to systemic inflammation.

\- **Remedies:** Identify and avoid allergens, use apple cider vinegar, and manage diet.

3\. **Low Cortisol:**

\- **Cause:** Stress-related adrenal fatigue or cortisol resistance exacerbate inflammation.

\- **Remedies:** Support with vitamin B1, improve sleep, manage stress, and consider adrenal support supplements.

4\. **High Insulin:**

\- **Cause:** Insulin resistance from excessive carb intake leads to systemic inflammation.

\- **Remedies:** Adopt Healthy Keto® diet, intermittent fasting, and potassium-rich foods.

5\. **Infection:**

\- **Cause:** Viral or bacterial infections can sustain inflammation if immune response is compromised.

\- **Remedies:** Boost immune system with vitamin D, intermittent fasting, and natural antibiotics.

6\. **Omega-6 Fatty Acids:**

\- **Cause:** Overconsumption promotes inflammation; replace with omega-3 sources.

\- **Remedies:** Avoid omega-6 rich oils and foods, opt for high-quality fish oil and grass-fed products.

7\. **Liver or Gallbladder Issues:**

\- **Cause:** Impaired bile production affects fat absorption and aggravates inflammation.

\- **Remedies:** Intermittent fasting, Healthy Keto® diet, purified bile salts, and avoiding alcohol and sugar.

8\. **Free Iron/Oxidants Damage:**

\- **Cause:** Excess free iron or oxidative stress can trigger inflammation and tissue damage.

\- **Remedies:** Avoid synthetic iron supplements and oxidant-rich foods, consider nutrient-rich sources like grass-fed organ meats.

Additional measures include intermittent fasting, probiotics for gut health, antioxidant-rich foods, and avoiding GMOs and processed foods. Addressing these factors can help manage and reduce chronic inflammation effectively.

## What Types Of Protein Sources Are Least Likely To Trigger Gout Symptoms

# What types of protein sources are least likely to trigger gout symptoms?

Uric acid, a protein byproduct, can crystallize in joints, causing inflammation, notably in gout. Key points include:

1\. Majority of uric acid (over 60%) originates internally, not from dietary sources.

2\. In gout, the issue lies predominantly in inefficient uric acid elimination by the kidneys, affecting 90% of sufferers.

On ketogenic diets and intermittent fasting:

\- Temporary spikes in uric acid occur during initial adaptation but typically normalize as the body adjusts. Uric acid serves as a potent antioxidant aiding in body healing and cleanup processes.

## What Are The Potential Health Benefits And Therapeutic Advantages Of C 8Abf22

# What are the potential health benefits and therapeutic advantages of chromium picolinate supplementation?

Chromium is a trace mineral needed in tiny amounts.  Insulin resistance is a situation where the receptors for insulin are resisting insulin; this then tells the pancreas to make more insulin. So, now you have high levels of insulin, but the insulin is ineffective. 

**There are a lot of side effects of having high insulin, such as:**

• Prediabetes

• Diabetes

• Belly fat

• Artery problems

• Eye problems 

• Kidney problems

• Heart problems

• Brain problems

• And more

**A few things chromium can do:** 

1\. Increase glucose transporters

2\. Decrease stress in endoplasmic reticulum

3\. Inhibit inflammation and oxidative stress 

4\. Increase glutathione 

**Benefits of chromium picolinate:**

1\. It can decrease cravings 

2\. It can help get you into keto faster 

3\. It can be beneficial for those with PCOS

## Does Eating Fat Lower Cholesterol

# Does eating fat lower cholesterol?

Your body makes 3000 milligrams of cholesterol each day. That’s the equivalent of 14 eggs or a pound of butter every single day. If you lower your dietary cholesterol, your body will make more to compensate.

**High-fat diets are often associated with high cholesterol, but fat isn’t the problem! Low-fat diets are also high in carbohydrates, which spike insulin and raise cholesterol. A high-fat diet like keto is an ideal diet for a healthy cholesterol level.**

On keto, it is still important to avoid unhealthy fats like trans fats, hydrogenated oils, soy oils, and deep-fried foods. Instead, opt for healthier fatty foods.

**Here are a few examples:**

•Avocado

•Nuts

•Grass-fed meat

•Grass-fed dairy

•Grass-fed butter

•Wild-caught fish

•Cod liver oil

These healthy fats are not harmful to your cholesterol or your heart. A low-carb, high-fat diet can prevent insulin spikes and help lower cholesterol. The majority of the population will experience lowered cholesterol by following a low-carb diet. As fat cells release stored fat, you may notice a temporary increase in blood cholesterol levels when you begin a ketogenic diet, but remember this is only temporary. Try keto for one month and check your cholesterol levels!

## Can Toothpaste Be Considered A Viable Therapeutic Intervention For Acn 26C514

# Can toothpaste be considered a viable therapeutic intervention for acne management?

Toothpaste is formulated for your teeth, not your skin. There are actually several ingredients in toothpaste that are not good for your skin.

**A few of these ingredients are:**

1\. Sodium bicarbonate This is very alkaline and can irritate your skin. It can also disrupt the natural bacteria of your skin.

2\. Sodium lauryl sulfate This can be too harsh on the skin. It can remove the oil layer and can cause irritation or even a rash.

3\. Triclosan This may make your bacteria resistant to antibiotics.

4\. Fluoride This could create a condition called fluoroderma, which actually looks like acne. If you want nice skin, don’t put toothpaste on it.

**Instead, try these four things:**

• Lower your carbs (get on the healthy keto diet)

• Do intermittent fasting

• Take probiotics

• Avoid dairy

## What Are The Primary Causes Of Low Testosterone And How Do Factors Suc A375F1

# What are the primary causes of low testosterone, and how do factors such as age, hormonal imbalances, and medical conditions contribute to this issue?

Low testosterone in men mainly is caused by the excess amount of other hormones in your body that counter testosterone. These hormones are cortisol, insulin and especially estrogen. The main remedy is to decrease the amounts of these hormones, which should greatly improve this condition.

**Symptoms:**

- Decreased libido

- Decreased erections

- Decreased vitality

- Weight gain (midsection)

- Can’t build muscle mass

- Skin thinner and softer

- Voice higher

- Prostate enlargement

- Breast tissue (man boobs)

- Loss of body hair

- Loss of collagen

- Reduction of sperm

**Cause #1: High estrogen**

High amounts of estrogen (the female hormone that is also produced in small amounts in a male body) can greatly lower the amounts of testosterone in your body. Consuming foods that are high in estrogen (like soy or GMO foods) can do that. If you have high amounts of body fat, it can do that too, as human body fat contains certain proteins that convert testosterone to estrogen.

**Remedies:**

- Consume foods that will lower estrogen levels:

    - cruciferous vegetables (natural estrogen blockers)

    - DIM (concentrated cruciferous)

    - white button mushrooms

    - mushrooms in general

    - celery

    - parsley

    - olive oil

- Avoid foods that will increase estrogen:

    - soy

    - vegetable oils

    - GMO foods

    - alcohol

    - soy-fed chicken

    - soy-fed beef

**Cause #2: High insulin**

One of the effects of insulin (the fat-storing hormone) is to lower testosterone in your body. If you are on a high-carb diet, this will increase the amount of insulin produced by your body to lower the blood sugar spikes after meals. Consuming snacks too often will raise insulin level after each of those snacks, too.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid refined sugar and carbs

- Avoid snacking

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

**Cause #3: High cortisol**

Your body is producing the stress hormone called cortisol to help you adapt to stressors from your environment. Cortisol in itself will lower testosterone levels in the body. If the stress is constant, or chronic, this can overwork your adrenals--making them produce excess cortisol too often.

**Remedies:**

- Take vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast • benfotiamine

- Improve your sleep

    - avoid blue lights (computer/phone) before going to bed

    - disconnect electronic devices from the outlets before going to bed

    - take naps if needed

    - try to go to bed before 10:30 p.m.

- Avoid watching news (bad news can keep you in a bad mood)

- Take magnesium

- Take vitamin D

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Take long walks outside (at least 45 minutes)

- Regularly exercise (don’t overtrain)

- You can also take my Adrenal & Cortisol Support

- You can also take my Adrenal Stress Advanced Formula

**Cause #2: High amounts of stress**

General remedies to raise the level of testosterone in your body

Once you’ve eliminated and remedied the main causes of low testosterone, the remedies below might not be needed. Your body should be producing enough testosterone by then, since there is nothing lowering it or converting it to something else. But you can apply the remedies below as additional ways to elevate your testosterone levels.

**Remedies:**

- Consume more cholesterol (helps to make testosterone)

- Consume moderate amounts of protein (6 to 8 oz of protein in meal)

- Full-body exercise

- HIIT exercise

- Improve sleep

- Consume zinc (100 mg / day)

- Consume korean red ginseng

- Take L-arginine

- Take D-aspartic acid

**Other causes:**

- Aging

- Fatty liver

- Too much iron

- Medications:

    • statins

    - high blood pressure meds

    - medications for diabetes

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Skin Discoloration And How Do Factors 8D1087

# What are the potential causes of skin discoloration, and how do factors such as sun exposure, medical conditions, and hormonal changes contribute to this issue?

Discolored skin patches commonly develop in a certain part of the body due to a difference in melanin levels (melanin is a substance that gives color to the skin and protects it from the sun). Sometimes you may have darkened skin spots, or whitened. Each of these has its own causes and remedies.

**If you have dark skin spots**

There are few different hormonal causes for the irregular work of melanin resulting in darkened skin spots. Usually this means that melanin is overproduced in a certain area of the skin.

- Insulin is responsible for lowering the blood sugar levels in your body. Additionally, insulin increases the level of certain hormones called androgens, which are responsible for dark spots on the skin and for acne.

- If your body has excess estrogen that can be the reason for skin discoloration or dark spots, especially if intermittent fasting and a Healthy Keto diet didn’t resolve the skin condition.

- Cortisol is a hormone that is being produced when you are undergoing stress, whether mental or physical. If you have chronic stress, this will cause too-high cortisol, which can result in dark spots on your skin.

**If you have white skin spots (tinea versicolor)**

White skin patches are caused by the type of fungus that is called tinea versicolor. This fungus causes white/lighter spots on the skin, mainly on the chest and back. It does it by blocking melanin (the substance that is responsible for skin coloration).

## What Underlying Factors Could Lead To Elevated Blood Sugar Levels Even Edd8Bc

# What underlying factors could lead to elevated blood sugar levels even in the absence of sugar consumption?

Even if you don't consume sugar, you can still have high blood sugar due to your liver and kidneys producing glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis. This process generates sugar from non-carbohydrate sources like fat and protein, and is regulated by insulin. If your insulin levels are too low or if you have insulin resistance, gluconeogenesis may not be properly turned off, leading to elevated blood sugar levels. Addressing insulin resistance could help manage and lower your blood sugar more effectively.

## What Are The Most Common Factors And Dietary Habits That Contribute To C8A81C

# What are the most common factors and dietary habits that contribute to flatulence, and how do they affect digestive health?

**#1 Low stomach acidity:** Flatulence is hydrogen and methane gas created by microbes in the process of carbohydrate and fiber fermentation. Your stomach pH should be between 1 and 3—this is highly acidic. Without high stomach acidity, your digestive process is put under stress, causing many digestive issues.

The best remedies for low stomach acidity:

• Betaine hydrochloride

• Apple cider vinegar

**#2 Food intolerance:** Another cause of gas is food intolerance. Lactose intolerance is a common problem that happens when your body lacks the enzymes that break down lactose. In turn, this causes excess gas. You can avoid lactose or take enzymes that help break down lactose. Gluten intolerance is also common—if you’re on Healthy Keto®, you don’t have to worry about gluten or grains. Probiotics can help fortify your microbes and potentially increase enzyme production.

**#3 Gas-producing foods:** Avoid these common gas-producing foods:

• Fruit

• Beans

• Legumes

• Starches (like potatoes and rice)

• Sugar

• Certain cruciferous vegetables (Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage)

• Onions Instead, consume more:

• Lettuce

• Tomato

• Zucchini

• Olives

• Avocado

**#4 Sugar alcohols and fiber:** Keto-friendly low-calorie sweeteners, sugar alcohols, and fiber can cause digestive discomfort when consumed excessively. If you begin to experience gas, reduce your intake of these keto treats.

**#5 Chewing gum:** Chewing gum and chewing with your mouth open can cause you to swallow excess air. Avoid chewing with your mouth open.

**#6 Carbonated Soda:** Carbonated drinks can increase gas in your system, leading to flatulence.

## What Factors Might Contribute To Experiencing Salt Cravings At Night

# What factors might contribute to experiencing salt cravings at night?

**If you crave salty foods like popcorn, peanuts, or chips, especially at night, this video is for you. I believe it’s because you’re deficient in sodium.** But why would you crave those junk foods and not just regular salt? It’s like when a pregnant woman craves ice cream, or how some people crave dirt. They may be deficient in calcium, or iron. Apparently when you’re deficient your body will initiate a craving for that particular mineral or nutrient you’re missing.

The World Health Organization (WHO) advises people to lower their salt intake to the equivalent of about one teaspoon per day. Most Americans consume one thousand times more than that! It’s coming from foods with hidden salts like refined carbs, bread, and deli meats, and not from the salt shaker.

But maybe it’s not the salt but the other ingredients in these foods. Before refrigeration, we salted foods to preserve them and the risk of heart attacks and high blood pressure was lower than now.

If you look at it logically, you add more salt, have more fluid, have higher blood pressure, have more heart attacks, right? But check out the links below to some studies I recommend you read. If you go on a low salt diet your risk of stroke, heart problems, and insulin resistance actually increases. Another study shows that when you increase sodium in your diet your risk of these conditions plummets. Why? Because people increasing their sodium were also increasing their potassium. Potassium protects your heart.

**The focus is on a low salt diet but hardly any emphasis on increasing potassium or, more importantly, removing refined carbs from the diet. In other words, to consume salt-free refined carbohydrates**. Your body has a hormone called aldosterone, which has one purpose: to hold sodium. Without sodium your nerves can’t conduct nerve impulses, your muscles can’t contract, and your fluids would be out of balance. You wouldn’t be able to transport calcium and other nutrients. A low salt diet triggers aldosterone, which has a cascade effect on your body. The side effects of not enough sodium are worse than having too much.

**The combination of a salt-free diet, diuretics, and drinking a lot of water is dangerous for your heart. When you’re on a ketogenic diet you need more salt. Add it back in. Consume one to one and one/half teaspoons per day of sea salt. Increase your vegetable intake. This should banish your salt cravings.**

## What Steps Should Be Taken If Youre Experiencing Unexplained Back Pain

# What steps should be taken if you're experiencing unexplained back pain?

First try the techniques in the video, and see if your lower back pain resolves. If not, then this could be why you still have lower back pain:

**You could have kidney stones.** They often occur only on one side. You can get them if you’re consuming a lot of spinach and nuts, and not drinking enough lemon juice in water. An excellent remedy for either oxalate stones or uric acid stones is hydroxy-citrate. I don’t recommend any particular brand, but you can research it yourself. It’s a very powerful compound that helps dissolve stones. I believe it’s more effective than potassium citrate.

**To prevent kidney stones, drink lemon juice in your water. Apple cider vinegar is another good remedy.**

**You could have endometriosis,** which is excess tissues growing in your abdomen. There’s a high level of estrogen involved. You could have fibroids, which is also a condition of estrogen dominance, or ovarian cysts. Another possibility is poly cystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which is a condition of high levels of androgens. If you have any of these, increase your intake of cruciferous vegetables, eliminate dairy, increase your intake of sea kelp, and do intermittent fasting.

**You also want to go low carb if you have PCOS.** High carbs increase your insulin, which in turn increases your androgens. In other words, do healthy keto.

**You may have an enlarged prostate**, in which case do keto and intermittent fasting, but also avoid dairy.

**Repetitive exercises** may also be the cause of your lower back pain. If possible, reverse the direction of the exercise to balance it out. If you’re a cyclist, the muscles you build up in your legs can throw off your lower back.

**Finally, you may be sitting too much!** Get a foam roller and put it under your back to create the arch it needs.

## What Effective Strategies And Approaches Can Be Employed To Address Fe E6520A

# What effective strategies and approaches can be employed to address feelings of weakness?

Weakness in simple words means lack of energy. Additional symptoms of weakness can include fatigue, feeling tired, etc. If you have any of the above symptoms, let’s find and remedy the most common causes for weakness.

**Cause 1: High-carb diet**

When you are on a high-carb diet you may often feel weak and tired. The reason behind this is that when you consume carbs, your blood sugar goes high. Although you may feel energetic, the feeling will go away very fast. Your body will produce insulin, which in its turn will lower the blood sugar, causing you to crave food and feel weak.

Additionally, consuming sugar in general will instantly make your body weaker! You can watch this video and try the experiment.

**Cause 2: Stress**

If you have chronic stress, it can wear your body out. Lack of sleep or vitamin B1 deficiency can lead to poor tolerance of stress and the inability of stress-regulating organs to work properly. These can definitely cause weakness.

## Can The Brain Function Effectively Without Carbohydrates

# Can the brain function effectively without carbohydrates?

Dr. Berg talks about the fuel source of the brain. Your brain can run on alternative fuel sources and you do not have to consume carbs or glucose to get energy. It can run on ketones, which is the byproduct of fat. If it needs glucose, it can make it from protein (dietary) and fat.

## What To Do Before During And After A Workout

# What to do before, during and after a workout?

It’s no surprise that there is an association between a lack of exercise and many different health concerns. One of the biggest benefits of exercise is that it increases the mitochondria. Various diseases are related to mitochondrial dysfunction, including cancer. Exercise also increases stem cells, which can turn into just about anything your body needs.

Exercise helps reduce stress, balance blood sugar levels, supports sleep, and has many other incredible health benefits.

**The four variables of exercise:**

1\. Duration

2\. Intensity

3\. Recovery

4\. Frequency

You need to give your body time to recover, not just between workouts but also during workouts. It's important to rest between four to five minutes between each set. This will allow your body to replenish ATP and help you train with maximum power. Intensity is key with exercise. Focus on higher intensity with more sets and lots of recovery. Many of the benefits of exercise also occur one to two days later during sleep.

Just a small amount of refined carbs can nullify the benefits of exercise. However, if you have diabetes or insulin resistance and are trying to build muscle on the keto diet, you can increase your carbs to 50 grams per day. The type of carbohydrates you can consume are berries and protein.

Other essential tips to increase the benefits from your workouts and support recovery:

1\. Do high-intensity interval training (HIIT)

2\. Come to a full stop vs. active recovery during HIIT workouts

3\. Put more focus on eccentric motions (elongating the muscles)

4\. Do contrasting therapy after you exercise

5\. Build up to exercising during a fasting state (eat one to two hours after a workout)

6\. Consume enough salt and electrolytes (consume electrolyte powder if needed)

7\. Consume red meat, eggs, and high-quality cheese

8\. Don’t exercise over soreness and focus on sleep instead

9\. Take copper before bed to enhance sleep

## Does Gluten Free Count As Keto

# Does gluten-free count as Keto?

I believe gluten is harmful, and a person should try to avoid it. However, just because something is gluten-free, this doesn’t mean it’s not going to raise your insulin.

For example, grains like wheat might be gluten-free, but it’s still going to affect your blood sugars. Gluten-free grains are better, in my opinion, than grains with gluten. But, it’s important to consume a low-carb diet (20-50g of carbs per day). A person could consume gluten-free grains in small amounts as long as they stick to only having 20-50g of carbs per day.

## Can I Drink Diet Coke Or Coke Zero On Keto

# Can I drink Diet Coke or Coke Zero on Keto?

Diet coke, coke zero and coke zero sugar have the same ingredients except for other sweeteners. It has aspartame which affects the gut, increase the risk for insulin resistance and diabetes. It also has caramel coloring where they heat sugar with an ammonia compound to produce an end product called AGE or Advanced Glycation Endproducts, which creates sticky proteins in the body.

## Why Are My Feet Shrinking On Keto

# Why are my feet shrinking on Keto?

This condition is called fluid retention. Glycogen is the storage of sugar in the body and when you are consuming a lot of carbohydrates, you are running your body out of the stored sugar. Each gram of glycogen is bonded to 2 grams of water. When you are doing a healthy ketogenic diet plan and intermittent fasting, it is very normal that you will dump a lot of the fluid.

• Glucose holds H2O

• Water follows glucose

• Glucose retains sodium

• Glucose rids excessive amounts of potassium

## Keto Kale Shake Without Fruits Or Berries

# Keto Kale Shake without Fruits or Berries

I want to tell you about making kale shakes without berries or fruit since some people don’t want the carbohydrates those items contain. First, blend the kale. I use the organic frozen kale from Trader Joe’s, and fill the blender about two-thirds full with the frozen kale.

Next, I add water to the same level as the kale, then blend for four minutes. Make sure you use a high-powered blender, or else the kale doesn’t come out smooth. The reason I blend the kale first is that otherwise, it foams up too high if you put in other ingredients before blending it.

Then add the rest of the ingredients, blending briefly after you add each one: one to three teaspoons of lemon juice, which helps prevent kidney stones and calcium deposits. One scoop of raw wheatgrass juice powder, lemon-flavored, which contains stevia and adds some sweetness without the carbs. One teaspoon of electrolyte powder, to get the benefit of its trace minerals and extra potassium.

Be sure to blend only briefly! If you do it too long, the shake will foam and overflow the blender. If you want to consume this shake as a meal, add one teaspoon of coconut oil. You can add more if you want. This gives you some seriously good fat. I love 100 percent organic, virgin, cold-pressed, and unrefined coconut oil.

There aren’t many carbs in the kale and low in protein. This is a very low-glycemic drink. If you’re on a two-meal per day schedule, you can drink this shake during your eating window, or in the morning when you wake up. What I do is drink half of it with a meal, wait an hour, then drink the rest. I store the shake in mason jars.

This shake is sometimes my entire salad for the day! It doesn’t really matter exactly when you drink it, it’s a matter of how much you can consume with a meal without feeling stuffed. If you need to, break it up into portions and consume a little at a time.

# Are Konjac noodles keto-friendly?

Other names for konjac noodles are miracle noodles or shirataki noodles. Konjac noodles are keto-friendly. They are 97% water and 3% fiber. Fiber is a carb, but it doesn’t have any effect on insulin. 

**This type of fiber can have some interesting effects, including:**

• It may act as a detox 

• It may help support weight loss

• It may help loosen mucus 

Something to keep in mind about these noodles is that they are flavorless. So, you’ll have to add things to them to make them flavorful. These noodles do not have the same texture as pasta noodles, but they’re similar. You may also get very thirsty if you consume these noodles. 

**Benefits of konjac noodles:**

• They can decrease hunger

• They may help stabilize your blood sugars

• They may help decrease constipation 

• They don’t have any calories 

**Other keto pasta alternatives:** 

• Spaghetti squash 

• Zucchini noodles

## What Dietary Choices Can Be Beneficial For Individuals With Parkinsons 1D7375

# What dietary choices can be beneficial for individuals with Parkinson’s disease?

There are proteins in the brain that can protect it against the oxidation that can lead to degenerative diseases. But there is also a protein in the brain that inhibits these protective proteins. Fortunately a compound called farnesol can deactivate the protein that inhibits the protective proteins. This allows the protective proteins to help prevent or slow down Parkinson’s disease and other degenerative diseases. Farnesol is in certain types of foods.

The best foods containing farnesol for Parkinson’s disease:

- Berries

- Vegetables (especially tomatoes, which are OK in moderate amounts on keto)

- Herbs (lemongrass, chamomile, rose and musk)

- Essential oils (citronella)

***Please keep in mind that the above information is not a medical advice. You should consult with your doctor first before making any dietary changes.***

## What Preventive Measures Can Be Taken To Reduce The Risk Of Blood Clot 74D865

# What preventive measures can be taken to reduce the risk of blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks?

Your body constantly forms and dissolves clots as part of its healthy functioning. A clot, called a thrombus, is made up of 96 percent protein and only 4 percent cholesterol. Yet many people believe cholesterol is the culprit, even though consuming cholesterol won’t form clots leading to strokes and heart attacks.

A clot can become a problem when it doesn’t dissolve. Your body produces a compound that blocks your ability to dissolve clots — and when this compound is elevated so too is your risk of a thrombus. Keeping the compound low is key, and can be done by avoiding four specific triggers that elevate it: glucose, insulin, cortisol, and estrogen.

Estrogen as a trigger explains why women who take hormone replacement therapy are at increased risk of a stroke. If you believe saturated fats are the culprit in blood clots, you can be assured they’re not. Saturated fats aren’t one of the triggers of the compound that prevents your body from dissolving clots as it normally would. This is good news if you’re already on or considering going on the keto diet, and were hesitant because you wondered if eating saturated fats might increase your risk of heart attacks and strokes. It won’t.

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## What Are The Underlying Factors That May Contribute To A Childs Overwe 83Cb6A

# What are the underlying factors that may contribute to a child's overweight status?

**Consuming too many carbohydrates might be number two, but the number one reason is snacking.** 

The problem with snacking is that you have various hormones that are secreted in your stomach and small intestine that will stimulate insulin after you eat. Snacking in-between the meals could keep insulin high. Insulin actually prevents the loss of fat, as well as causes the storage of fat. 

**The most common snacks kids are fed:**

1\. Flavored yogurt—3.5oz has about 13g of sugar

2\. Popcorn—very high on the glycemic index

3\. Applesauce—very high on the glycemic index

4\. Energy bar—a granola bar could have 19g of net carbs 

5\. Juice—very high on the glycemic index

6\. Crackers and peanut butter—can be very high on the glycemic index

7\. Apples—on average contain around 19g of sugar 

**What you could do:**

• Don’t keep any snacks that are high in carbohydrates in the house.

• Make a transition to no snacking using healthier snacks first. 

• Ideally, don’t give the child any snacks. Give them 3 nutrient-dense meals, with enough calories and healthy fats.

## Are Cheat Days On A Diet Beneficial

# Are cheat days on a diet beneficial?

Some weight loss plans have cheat days built into the program. But this isn’t a good idea because it can severely affect your results. Once you go off of a diet plan, it’s really hard to get back on it.

That said, sometimes it can be encouraging to go off keto just to see how much better you feel when you’re on keto and doing it correctly. The goal is to create enough health and discipline that you can go off of the keto plan very temporarily and then go right back on. The best way to tell if someone is cheating on keto or staying healthy is to look at their A1C. An A1C test measures how much glucose is stuck to the protein in your blood.

The more sugar in your body, the higher percentage of your hemoglobin is affected by glucose. You would want your A1C percentage to be below 5.7. The best way to know that the keto program is working and you’re in ketosis is a loss of appetite. But, all it takes is a very small amount of carbohydrates to take you out of ketosis for a couple of days—even half a glass of wine will have this effect.

**This means a cheat day will knock you out of the program for a good amount of time. If someone is cheating every other day or every third day, they're not going to make very good progress.**

**How to support healthy blood sugar:**

1\. Consume nutrient-dense foods on keto (Healthy Keto®)

2\. Consume apple cider vinegar in water

3\. Consume berberine

## What Are Top Foods To Lose Belly Fat

# What are top foods to lose belly fat?

Cortisol, a stress hormone, converts protein into sugar, prompting the liver to produce sugar from non-carbohydrate sources like fat, ketones, and protein. High cortisol levels lead to increased sugar production, which elevates insulin, and in turn, contributes to belly fat. Consuming a high-carb diet, sugar, or eating frequently also spikes insulin, leading to belly fat.

Belly fat typically appears after the liver becomes fatty, as visceral fat around the organs often results from fat spill-off from the liver. Therefore, the best foods to reduce belly fat are those that lower insulin, decrease cortisol, or support liver health.

Ten foods that help reduce belly fat:

1\. Eggs

2\. Salmon

3\. Cod liver and cod liver oil

4\. Sauerkraut

5\. Cruciferous vegetables

6\. Hamburger

7\. Avocados

8\. Broccoli sprouts

9\. Asparagus

10\. Nutritional yeast (non-fortified)

## Can Eating Salad Contribute To Weight Gain

# Can eating salad contribute to weight gain?

Hidden carbs from croutons, dried fruit, or salad dressings can cause weight gain, but if you're following keto and intermittent fasting, they are likely not the issue.

Increased salad intake may lead to digestive issues if your body lacks the necessary microbes and enzymes. Vegetables contain two types of fiber: soluble (retains water) and insoluble (does not). Inadequate fiber breakdown can slow digestion and cause water retention, leading to weight gain.

To prevent this, try:

1\. Steaming vegetables to break down fiber.

2\. Choosing easier-to-digest vegetables like squash, cauliflower, broccoli, and asparagus.

3\. Gradually increasing vegetable intake to build up gut microflora.

This approach helps reduce bloating and water retention while your body adjusts to digesting fiber efficiently.

## Can Adrenal Fatigue Lead To Weight Gain

# Can adrenal fatigue lead to weight gain?

Adrenal fatigue, particularly chronic stress, can lead to weight gain, exacerbated by poor dietary habits. Cortisol, released during stress, increases energy (sugar) storage as fat when unused, and can degrade muscle mass by converting it into sugar. Additionally, cortisol inhibits fat burning, making ketosis difficult.

Addressing stress sources is crucial. Implementing Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting can help, along with ensuring adequate intake of vitamin D, vitamin C, and potassium.

## Whats The Relation Between Extreme Hunger And Intermittent Fasting

# What's the relation between extreme hunger and intermittent fasting?

Hunger is a great indicator of whether you are doing intermittent correctly. If the hunger is too high and severe WITH additional blood sugar issues (dizziness, lightheadedness, irritability, sugar cravings, and brain fog), then you need to cut back and add a meal or add more fat with a meal.

The other thing to do is add electrolytes to your fasting period and some bone broth as this will make it easier to go from 1 meal to the next. If you just have some hunger and it's not too severe - ride the wave and keep going.

## What Causes A Stinky Odor After Urination

# What causes a stinky odor after urination?

If you are not on a ketogenic diet and you’re not doing intermittent fasting, but you’re getting a stinky urine odor, it could be a urinary tract infection, liver damage, eating the wrong foods, or not having enough vegetables.

If you are on a keto diet, it could also be ketones that aren’t being burned. This often happens if you’re still adapting to keto. Keto adaptation can take several weeks. Over time, you will burn those ketones, and they won’t cause an odor.

If you have an ammonia smell, it could be that you’re consuming too much protein, or you have liver damage.

**Here’s what you can do for a strong urine odor:**

1\. Liver support - consume plenty of healthy vegetables (beet tops and dandelion greens)

2\. Fluids - drink plenty of water throughout the day

3\. Adjust proteins - lower your protein (3-6 oz is plenty)

4\. Chlorophyll - wheatgrass juice powder is a great source of chlorophyll

## Is There A Time Period That I Should Be Following Keto And Intermitten 97D6F3

# Is there a time period that I should be following Keto and Intermittent Fasting?

**The ketogenic diet is a lifelong commitment. Healthy keto with intermittent fasting will work while you do it, but the benefits will stop if you stop. You might see some awesome keto diet results, or intermittent fasting results and think it’s ok to stop. But, the long term effects of keto are so beneficial, you really don’t want to stop.**

The purpose of doing the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting is for so much more than just weight loss. Doing keto long term is a way of eating to minimize health problems.  You will eventually build up your health reserve, and you will be able to go off of the program here and there. But, there are no phases of the ketogenic diet. After you reach your keto weight loss goal, instead of adding in carbs, you can add in more calories and more fat.

There are multiple incredible benefits of healthy keto, ketosis, and intermittent fasting. Ketones are a more efficient fuel that your brain and heart prefer. But, one of the biggest problems out there right now is high insulin.

**Healthy keto with intermittent fasting will help you reduce your insulin, which will benefit your:**

• Heart

• Liver

• Brain

• Hormones

• Immune System

• Nerves

• Kidneys

• Eyes

## What Are The Potential Health Risks Associated With The Presence Of Gl D19B13

# What are the potential health risks associated with the presence of glucose in urine?

It means that your blood sugars or the glucose in your blood are minimally at 225 or more – this is one of the ways that the body is trying to get rid of the toxic glucose by peeing it out and it is called Osmotic Diuresis.

The complication of having this is it pulls out minerals specifically potassium, sodium, chloride, and more that cause dehydration.

**Low Minerals Symptoms:**

• Headache

• Fatigue

• Confusion

• Purple nails

• Heart problems

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies For Stress Management

# What are the most effective strategies for stress management?

1\. Increase your sleep - If you aren’t getting enough sleep at night, you’re not going to be able to be patient and stress-free throughout the day. Avoid blue light before bed and get 7-8 hours of quality sleep.

2\. Get plenty of vitamin B1 - Vitamin B1 directly affects your tolerance to stress. Get vitamin B1 from a natural source, like nutritional yeast.

3\. Lower your carbohydrates - A high-carb diet will cause significant blood sugar and insulin fluctuations, which can cause significant irritability and boost your stress.

4\. Avoid the news - The news can be overwhelmingly negative, and it can add unnecessary fear and stress to your life.

5\. Exercise - Exercise increases the oxygen in your blood and lowers your stress naturally. Long walks are especially good for lowering your stress levels.

6\. Magnesium - This mineral is great for lowering your stress levels. 7 cups of vegetables and a bottle of mineral water a day will give you plenty of magnesium.

7\. Vitamin D - Get plenty of sunlight or supplement vitamin D. Vitamin D helps reduce stress and anxiety as well as support healthy sleep.

8\. Ketones - Ketones elevate your mood and promote healthy stress levels. Get on keto and intermittent fasting.

9\. Change your environment - Get outside and enjoy nature. This can really help slow down your pace and get rid of stress.

## What Are The Most Effective Natural Methods To Enhance Testosterone Levels

# What are the most effective natural methods to enhance testosterone levels?

1\. Increase your cholesterol intake - Do not go on a low-fat diet! Cholesterol is a precursor to testosterone.

2\. Moderate protein - High amounts of protein can cause insulin to spike, which can disrupt a healthy hormone balance. 6-8 oz of meat per meal should be plenty.

3\. Lower your carbs - Carbohydrates boost your insulin levels, which can lower your T level. A low-carb diet such as keto is ideal for boosting your testosterone naturally. Add intermittent fasting for an extra boost.

4\. Exercise - High-intensity interval training (HIIT) will help stimulate testosterone.

5\. Sleep - Getting enough sleep is vital to normal and healthy hormone levels. Poor quality and duration of sleep can cause an increase in cortisol, which can throw off your testosterone level. Long walks are great for getting better sleep and lowering cortisol.

6\. Lower your estrogen - Testosterone and estrogen oppose each other. If you have high estrogen, you will have lower testosterone. Avoid soy and non-organic products.

7\. Supplements - Zinc, Korean red ginseng, L-arginine, and D-aspartic acid are great supplements for supporting healthy testosterone levels.

The last couple of things I want to mention is that a fatty liver, high iron levels, and statin drugs may also cause low testosterone levels. Make sure you talk with your doctor about these potential problems.

## Can Excessive Calcium Intake Lead To Kidney Stones

# Can excessive calcium intake lead to kidney stones?

Studies show that taking around 500mg of calcium carbonate will increase your risk of developing kidney stones. Massive doses of vitamin D over many months can also cause hypercalcemia, which can contribute to kidney stones. However, neither of these are the primary causes of kidney stones.

**The most common reasons for kidney stones are:**

1\. Kidney damage - years of bad dieting can cause poor kidney function. Try a healthy keto diet.

2\. Excess oxalates - avoid oxalate-rich foods, including almonds, spinach, swiss chard, and chocolate.

3\. Low citrates - take citrates or lemon juice.

4\. Low fluid - stay hydrated! At least 2.5 liters each day.

5\. Poor microbiome - improve your microbiome with probiotics and prebiotics (fiber).

6\. Low bile - take purified bile salts if you have low bile or a missing gallbladder.

## What Causes Palpitations After Eating

# What causes palpitations after eating?

Palpitations, irregular heartbeats such as skipped or extra beats, can stem from various causes related to cardiac function:

1\. **Digestive Issues (Gallbladder Problems)**: Address with intermittent fasting and avoiding refined carbs and vegetable oils, opting for a healthy keto diet.

2\. **Alkalinity**: Manage through healthy keto practices and incorporating apple cider vinegar to balance pH levels.

3\. **Low Potassium**: Causes include diuretics, diarrhea, antacids, and insufficient dietary intake of potassium-rich foods (7-10 cups of vegetables daily).

Managing these factors can help alleviate palpitations and promote heart health.

## What Potential Health Advantages Does Chromium Provide

# What potential health advantages does chromium provide?

Chromium is a trace mineral needed in tiny amounts. 

Insulin resistance is a situation where the receptors for insulin are resisting insulin; this then tells the pancreas to make more insulin. So, now you have high levels of insulin, but the insulin is ineffective. 

**There are a lot of side effects of having high insulin, such as:**

• Prediabetes

• Diabetes

• Belly fat

• Artery problems

• Eye problems 

• Kidney problems

• Heart problems

• Brain problems

• And more

**A few things chromium can do:** 

1\. Increase glucose transporters

2\. Decrease stress in endoplasmic reticulum

3\. Inhibit inflammation and oxidative stress 

4\. Increase glutathione 

**Benefits of chromium picolinate:**

1\. It can decrease cravings 

2\. It can help get you into keto faster 

3\. It can be beneficial for those with PCOS

## Why Is It Difficult To Sleep Without Carbohydrates

# Why is it difficult to sleep without carbohydrates?

It can take a long time to fix insulin resistance, even once you make the switch to a ketogenic diet. With insulin resistance, you have higher amounts of insulin. With keto, you consume lower amounts of carbohydrates. But, you're still going to have high insulin despite cutting out the carbs because of the resistance problem.

Higher amounts of insulin can push the blood sugars down too low in the middle of the night. With low blood sugars, you have counter hormones that keep your blood sugars from going down too low. The two main ones are cortisol and adrenaline. These two hormones are behind many sleeping problems.

**What to do if you can't fall asleep without carbs:**

1\. Time (as you fix insulin resistance, this problem will get better)

2\. Take electrolytes (potassium, magnesium, and calcium)

3\. Take apple cider vinegar before bed

4\. Adjust the amount of protein you consume as your last meal

5\. Consume more vegetables

6\. Take vitamin B1

7\. Limit caffeine consumption

8\. Take exogenous ketones before bed

9\. Get more vitamin D by being in the sun or by taking vitamin D

## Why Would Triglycerides Elevate On Keto

# Why would triglycerides elevate on Keto?

Normally, your triglycerides should be low, but if they’re high, there could be several reasons why. 

Your fat is a storage place for triglycerides. When you do keto, the triglycerides are mobilized, and they come out of the fat cell. They’re there to be used as energy. 

I believe fasting 12-14 hours before you get your triglycerides tested is very important. This way, the test isn’t affected by what you just ate or drank that may have temporarily caused your triglycerides to be higher. Consuming alcohol or carbs two days before the test can also cause your triglycerides to be temporarily high. 

**A few potential causes of high triglycerides:** 

• A hypothyroid condition 

• A problem with the gallbladder 

• The transitional phase of keto 

• Hidden carbohydrates 

• Hidden fats

## How Long Does It Typically Take To Reverse Fatty Liver Disease

# How long does it typically take to reverse fatty liver disease?

To effectively alleviate fatty liver symptoms, consider these key strategies:

1\. **Healthy Keto Diet**: A low-carb, low-sugar approach like Healthy Keto, emphasizing vegetables and moderate protein, can significantly benefit fatty liver conditions.

2\. **Intermittent Fasting**: Adopting intermittent fasting, gradually extending fasting periods to promote liver healing and enter autophagy, a state where damaged proteins are repaired.

3\. **Choline Supplementation**: Incorporate choline-rich foods or supplements like vitamin B complex with nutritional yeast to support liver function and aid in fat metabolism.

4\. **Cruciferous Vegetables**: Increase intake of organic cruciferous vegetables and fermented foods to enhance gut health, which is linked to liver health improvement.

These remedies can help mitigate fatty liver symptoms over time, depending on the chronicity and extent of liver damage and the consistency of dietary improvements.

## How Can Fatty Liver Disease Contribute To A Slowdown In Thyroid Function

# How can fatty liver disease contribute to a slowdown in thyroid function?

Fatty liver disease can stem from excessive alcohol consumption or a diet high in sugars and refined carbohydrates, leading to insulin spikes and insulin resistance. This condition, known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), causes liver inflammation and scar tissue formation.

Common signs include abdominal obesity and can be diagnosed via ultrasound, revealing diminished liver function and reduced bile production. A fatty liver impairs cholesterol regulation and interferes with thyroid hormone conversion (T4 to T3), potentially leading to hypothyroidism and metabolic slowdown.

Addressing these issues with a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting can alleviate insulin resistance symptoms. Increasing intake of cruciferous and other vegetables, along with choline supplements, supports the removal of fat from the liver, aiding in the reversal of fatty liver disease over time.

## Does Fiber Make Me Fat

# Does fiber make me fat?

Fiber is a carbohydrate, however, it doesn’t have a direct effect on blood sugars and you can’t even digest it.

The benefit of vegetable fiber is turning the microbes into a healthy fat called butyrate. Butyrate reduces insulin resistance which can help you lose weight.

Low amounts of microbes cause you to gain weight and the combination of low microbes in the gut and fiber could cause bloating, gas, and other issues. He also talks about several causes of low microbes and the condition called SIBO or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

**Vegetable Fibers Benefits:**

• Vitamins

• Minerals

• Trace minerals

• Butyrate

• B Vitamins

• Buffer pH

• Phytonutrients

**Functions of Bile:**

• Helps prevent fatty liver

• Helps with lowering blood sugars and improving insulin resistance

## What Steps Should Be Taken If Conventional Acne Treatments Prove Ineffective

# What steps should be taken if conventional acne treatments prove ineffective?

Let's say you've tried everything to get rid of acne, including the healthy version of keto and fasting, but you still have acne. What can you do? If you haven't tried healthy keto and fasting yet, this combination may be very beneficial to help clear up acne.

A spike in androgens, a spike in estrogen, or a spike in both of these hormones could be what's behind your acne. Stress is one thing that can spike androgens and cause acne. It's important to do what you can to lower your stress levels.

DHT is something that can trigger acne. A few potential remedies for acne in this situation are saw palmetto, stinging nettle root, or black cohosh. A spike in estrogen (estrogen dominance) can be behind acne, especially cystic acne. There is an enzyme called aromatase that converts testosterone into estrogen. A few potential natural remedies for acne in this situation are stinging nettle root, cruciferous vegetables, and DIM.

Your liver regulates excessive amounts of hormones, especially estrogen. There could be something going on creating a buffer. A powerful natural remedy for this situation is milk thistle. Of course, the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting may be beneficial too.

High levels of insulin can potentially cause acne and many other symptoms. Consuming a high-carb diet could cause high levels of insulin.

Dairy may also cause high estrogen. If you have a problem with acne, cutting out dairy may clear it up.

**Tips to get rid of acne:**

• Avoid dairy

• Avoid sugar and refined carbs

• Lower your stress

• Take certain herbs based on your situation

• Take zinc

• Take cod liver oil

• Avoid fluoride

## How Can One Effectively Overcome Addiction And Implement Strategies To D55C30

# How can one effectively overcome addiction and implement strategies to prevent relapse for long-term recovery?

**Addiction to substances like nicotine, alcohol, and drugs can be incredibly difficult to overcome. These addictions harm our mental and physical health and deplete essential nutrients in the body, particularly NAD.**

**NAD is a crucial coenzyme involved in over 500 different chemical reactions in the body.** It plays a vital role in energy production, DNA repair, and maintaining proper cellular functioning. However, addiction to substances like nicotine, alcohol, and drugs can significantly deplete NAD levels in the body.

**Symptoms of NAD deficiency include fatigue, muscle soreness, weight gain, difficulty sleeping and concentrating, brain fog, and decreased stamina. These symptoms can make it even harder for someone to overcome an addiction.**

**WHAT TO DO**

To combat NAD deficiency, consider taking vitamin B3, also known as niacin. Niacin helps increase NAD levels in the body, improving energy, helping to reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings, and aiding in addiction recovery.

Some people may experience a flushing response on their skin when taking niacin, which can be uncomfortable. In this case, no-flush niacin can be used instead. In addition to supplementing with niacin, there are other ways to increase NAD levels in the body, such as intermittent fasting, following a healthy ketogenic diet, and regular exercise. These lifestyle changes can support addiction recovery and overall well-being. In some cases, clinics offer IV therapy for NAD to help with addiction recovery. However, this can be expensive and not accessible to everyone.

## What Are The Potential Effects On The Body When Electrolyte Levels Bec E7A06B

# What are the potential effects on the body when electrolyte levels become depleted?

Electrolytes power the nervous system, muscles, and cells. They also control fluid balance within the cells and outside of the cells.

**Warning signs of an electrolyte deficiency:**

1\. Arrhythmias or heart palpitations

2\. Fatigue or weakness

3\. Dizziness and dehydration

## What Are The Common Causes Of Bedwetting

# What are the common causes of bedwetting?

Bedwetting is a common problem in children, but many adults can have accidents or near accidents too. Getting up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night has the same root cause as bedwetting.

**Cause #1: High insulin**

Bedwetting is caused by high levels of insulin. And that results from a high-carb diet. Carbohydrates spike your insulin levels. Over time, this causes the cells to develop a resistance to insulin--which then causes higher insulin production by your body. As you know, Insulin lowers blood sugar. When the blood sugar goes down your body lets go of excess liquid. This can happen at night.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid sugar and refined carbs

- Avoid grains

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

- Do a Healthy Keto® diet

- Consume vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)

- Consume vegetable shakes

**Get plenty of insulin-regulating nutrients**

• chromium
• potassium
• B vitamins (nutritional yeast)

## Is It Advisable To Take Niacin And Tudca Together And What Are The Pot 1Cc099

# Is it advisable to take niacin and TUDCA together, and what are the potential benefits or interactions between these two supplements?

Niacin and TUDCA should only be taken together if there is a specific concern. TUDCA, a bile salt containing choline, aids digestion and breaks down cholesterol. If you follow a healthy ketogenic diet with low carbs and intermittent fasting, you typically don't need to worry about cholesterol. Issues arise when the diet is not followed strictly, or if carbohydrates are still being consumed.

## What Are The Primary Causes Of Hepatitis C

# What are the primary causes of Hepatitis C?

Hepatitis C is a viral infection that targets liver cells, leading to inflammation and potentially severe complications like diabetes, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Symptoms include fatigue, flu-like symptoms, dark urine, abdominal pain, and jaundice.

Causes and remedies:

\- **Infection:** Hepatitis C is transmitted through blood contact. Strengthening the immune system is crucial. Adopting the Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting can reduce liver inflammation and aid recovery. Limiting iron intake starves the virus.

\- **Supporting Liver Health:** Consume antioxidants like parsley, cruciferous vegetables, milk thistle, and vitamins (C, E, B complex). Enhance immune function with oregano oil, garlic, and vitamin D. Avoid liver-damaging substances such as alcohol, vegetable oils, and omega-6 fatty acids.

\- **Medications:** Reduce medication intake under medical supervision as some medications can strain the liver.

Managing these factors supports liver recovery and overall health when dealing with hepatitis C.

## What Are The Main Causes Of High Androgen Levels

# What are the main causes of high androgen levels?

Excess androgens, male sex hormones present in both men and women, lead to symptoms like facial hair, hair loss, and PCOS in women, and hair loss and prostate issues in men.

**Causes and Remedies:**

1\. **Conversion to DHT:**

Enzymes convert testosterone to DHT, exacerbating symptoms:

\- Use spearmint tea, red reishi mushroom, licorice, green tea, black cohosh, chaste tree, and DIM supplements.

2\. **Estrogen Conversion Blockage:**

Glyphosate in non-organic foods inhibits enzyme activity:

\- Avoid GMOs and choose organic foods.

3\. **High Insulin:**

Refined carbs and sugar spike insulin, increasing androgens:

\- Avoid refined carbs, sugar, and snacking; follow Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting.

4\. **High Stress:**

Stress boosts adrenal androgen production:

\- Take vitamin B1, manage stress, improve sleep, and take walks.

\- Supplement with calcium, potassium, and magnesium.

\- Consider adrenal support supplements.

These steps help regulate androgen levels, alleviating associated symptoms and supporting overall health.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Joint Pain

# What are the potential causes of joint pain?

Joint pain is a problem that can be resolved by nutrition and proper diet. Certain foods and nutrients can reduce the inflammation and speed the recovery process of your joints and bones.

**Cause #1: Nutritional deficiencies**

When you are lacking certain vitamins in your body it can cause a lot of joint pain. This is because these certain vitamins are required for the healthy functioning of your joints and body tissues.

**Vitamin D3** is one of the most powerful natural anti-inflammatory vitamins. It will help with joint pain and reduce inflammation.

**Vitamin K2** is a vital nutrient that helps to move excess calcium deposits from your joints into your bones.

**Vitamin C** helps to develop and repair bones and joints in your body by making collagen (proteins for bones and joints). If you have fatigue in addition to joint pain that’s a good indicator of vitamin C deficiency.

Colostrum is a great anti-inflammatory and a good supplement for joint pain.

**Vitamin D3 (get 20,000 to 40,000 IU daily):**

- Consume cod liver oil

- Get more exposure to the sun

- Take a vitamin D3 supplement

**Vitamin K2** (get 300 to 400 mcg daily):

- Consume vitamin K2-rich foods:

    - grass-fed milk

    - cheese

    - butter

    - goose liver

    - grass-fed organic egg yolks

- Get vitamin K2 supplement (MK-7 version)

**Vitamin C:**

- Consume vitamin C-rich foods:

    - sauerkraut

    - bell pepper

    - berries

    - raw lemons

- Take natural vitamin C complex (not ascorbic acid)

- Avoid refined carbs and sugar

- Avoid snacking

- Consume colostrum for joint pain

**Cause #2: Mycotoxins**

Mycotoxins are various poisons which are released from mold and fungus that can affect your joints and your immune system in a bad way. One thing to know is that consuming refined carbs and sugar will worsen the problem as mold and fungus live on sugar and carbs.

**Remedies:**

- If you have mold in your house, locate and get rid of it

- Avoid antibiotics

- Avoid GMO foods

- Avoid sweets and carbs

- Consume grapefruit seed oil

- Consume bentonite clay

- Consume garlic

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

**Cause #3: Omega-6 fatty acids**

When you consume certain oils that contain omega-6 fatty acids, they can greatly spike the inflammation in your body and this alone can cause you to have joint pain. The solution would be to avoid foods with omega-6 fatty acids and to consume more foods with omega-3 fatty acids (these are anti-inflammatory).

**Remedies:**

- Avoid foods containing omega-6 fats:

- corn oil

- soy oil

- canola oil

- cottonseed oil

- sunflower oil

- vegetable oils in general

- too many nuts

- Substitute with these oils containing omega-3:

- butter

- olive oil

- coconut oil

- cod liver oil

- high-quality fish oil

- Consume fatty fish

- Consume sardines

**Other causes:**

- Muscle compensation

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- DJD (degenerative joint disease)

- Gallbladder problem (indicated by right shoulder pain)

- Injuries

- Sacroiliac (S-I)

## When Should Magnesium Not Be Taken For Sleep And Anxiety And What Are  29Bb1C

# When should magnesium not be taken for sleep and anxiety, and what are the potential risks or contraindications to consider?

Sometimes, low magnesium is not the cause of your anxiety or sleep problems, and taking it can even worsen your symptoms. The second part of sleep is called REM sleep. People with higher levels of adrenaline and cortisol tend to wake up around 2:00 am during REM sleep. Magnesium will not fix this problem because the high cortisol levels are not caused by low magnesium.

Stress and lack of exercise can cause poor sleep. Exercise, long walks, and physical labor can reduce stress and improve sleep. If you find that you have difficulty getting to sleep because of racing thoughts and overthinking, you may be low in vitamin B1. Carbs, sugar, and caffeine can deplete vitamin B1. Taking B1 before bed can provide an immediate sense of calmness. Always choose a natural B1 supplement, not synthetic.

Instead of taking a melatonin supplement, it can be more beneficial to address why you do not have enough melatonin in the first place. Melatonin is inhibited by blue light. Darkness and infrared light recharge melatonin, so try getting sunlight or sitting by a fire. Vitamin D before bed can help you sleep. Magnesium will not work if you're very low in vitamin D and vice versa.

If you're new to fasting and you go to bed hungry, it can interfere with your sleep. If fasting triggered your sleep problem, scale back, and begin fasting more gradually over time. Try incorporating more carbs at your last meal and increasing your carb intake to 50 grams per day. Having plenty of sea salt on keto and intermittent fasting is vital. Salt causes your body to retain fluid, so not only will it help you sleep, but it can also help prevent waking to use the bathroom. If you do need magnesium, try taking magnesium glycinate to help support sleep and reduce anxiety.

    - vitamin B2

    - vitamin B3

    - vitamin B5

    - folate

    - manganese

    - magnesium

    - potassium

    - trace minerals

4. Rich in phytonutrients (healthy substances found in plants):

5. sulforaphanes

6. glucosinolates

7. carotenoids

8. flavonoids

9. Contains DIM

    - balances estrogen ratios

    - supports natural detoxification

10. Low in carbs

**How to consume it**

You can eat it raw with dip or include it in your salad. Or cook it in a dozen ways.

There are many ways to prepare cauliflower. One favorite is to make it into pizza crust. Or you can find pre-made cauliflower crusts at the grocery store. Just be sure to check the label because sometimes the manufacturers slip in the ingredients like tapioca starch, dextrin and other things that aren’t keto-friendly.

Then there’s cauliflower rice. Nowadays you can find it at any grocery store because it’s become a mainstream product. It tastes almost identical to rice but without the starch.

Keep in mind that the longer you cook cauliflower, the more you destroy its nutrients. 3 minutes of boiling, for example, equals ten minutes of steaming. So steam it for just 5 minutes. Sauteing it is another recommended method. Ultimately, even if you cook it for a relatively long time, you still get the benefits of cauliflower’s low carbs and its fiber.

**Where to get it**

You can get it at any grocery store.

## What Are The Potential Reasons And Considerations For Avoiding The Use A1D155

# What are the potential reasons and considerations for avoiding the use of valerian root before sleep?

**Valerian Root: Helps with Anxiety, Not So Much with Sleep**

Valerian root is a natural herb with calming effects. It works similarly to medications like Valium by influencing GABA, a neurotransmitter that reduces stress and promotes relaxation. This can be helpful for anxiety, but there's a catch:

- **Valerian's Sedative Effects:** While it calms anxiety, valerian can cause drowsiness, sluggishness, even insomnia for some. It's NOT a reliable sleep aid.

**Getting to the Root Cause**

Anxiety and sleep problems are often symptoms of deeper imbalances:

- **Hormones:** High cortisol (the stress hormone) is a major culprit.

- **Melatonin/Serotonin Connection:** Low melatonin affects sleep, and can also contribute to low serotonin, linked to depression.

**Natural Solutions: Beyond Supplements**

While you CAN supplement melatonin, it's best to support your body's own production. Here's how:

1. **Exercise:** Gets your body primed for healthy sleep cycles.

2. **Sunlight:** Infrared rays naturally boost melatonin.

3. **Vitamin B1:** Found in nutritional yeast, sunflower seeds. Supports overall nervous system health.

4. **Gut Health:** Probiotics support the production of calming neurotransmitters.

5. **Diet:** Healthy keto and intermittent fasting can benefit hormone balance.

**Important:**

- Valerian may interact with medications. Talk to your doctor before using.

- Lifestyle changes take time but have lasting benefits.

## What Are The Potential Causes Of Charley Horses

# What are the potential causes of charley horses?

A muscle cramp or charley horse is an uncontrolled muscle contraction that is sudden and painful. It often occurs during exercise or at night. Muscle cramps commonly occur in the calf muscle, but they can also occur in the foot and, occasionally, in the thigh.

**Cause #1: Magnesium and potassium deficiency (electrolytes)**

Magnesium and potassium are the electrolytes (electrically charged minerals) that are very important for correct muscle work and relaxation.

Magnesium is the relaxation mineral. Having enough of it will prevent cramps from occurring as your muscles will be naturally relaxed.

Potassium is responsible for high cellular energy as well as relaxation of the body in general-- along with many other functions. Your body needs 4,700 mg of potassium daily, which is about 7 to 10 cups of vegetables a day.

**Remedies:**

- Consume magnesium-rich foods

- Consume vegetables (7 to 10 cups daily)

- Consume magnesium and potassium supplements

- Take apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water) to improve the absorption of calcium and magnesium

**Cause #2: Too much calcium**

Too much calcium in the diet can cause a lot of calcium residue in your muscle tissues as well as in your joints. Calcium does cause contraction of the muscles, and if you have an excess of it, it can cause cramps. Additionally, sometimes you may consume moderate amounts of calcium and still get cramps; this could be because calcium is not absorbed properly and not mobilised to the bones once it is absorbed. In this case you can take vitamin D and K2.

**Remedies:**

- Avoid calcium carbonate

- Consume vitamin D3 and K2

- Consume natural sources of calcium (like european cheese, kefir, etc.)

**Cause #3: Alkalosis**

If you have too alkaline a body pH it can result in muscle cramps. The reason behind it is that when your body pH is higher than normal it can result in inability to utilize the free calcium that is in your body. Calcium, in the right amounts and correctly utilized by your body, is needed for healthy muscle contractions. The solution would be to acidify your body.

**Remedies:**

- Take apple cider vinegar (1 to 2 teaspoons stirred into about a cup of water, with your meals)

- Take betaine hydrochloride

- You can also drink these acidifiers:

    - kombucha tea

    - pickle juice

- Take potassium

- Avoid antacids

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do an intermittent fasting plan

- Avoid tap water (use a filter if needed)

**Other causes:**

- Medication for high blood pressure

- Medication for high cholesterol

- Prednisone

## What Are The Possible Reasons For Insufficient Muscle Growth

# What are the possible reasons for insufficient muscle growth?

Lack of muscle growth can have several underlying reasons; however it has simple and effective remedies.

**Cause #1: Lack of workout intensity**

To be able to have muscle growth you have to do higher weights and lower reps. This is because your muscle tissues need to be damaged from the exercise for your body to heal them and make them bigger. Make sure your technique is correct to avoid injuries and gradually increase the intensity.

**Remedies:**

- Hire a personal trainer to help you with the workouts and technique

- Put enough weights so you can barely do 5 to 7 reps (make sure you gradually increase the weights)

- Do more compound exercises that affect several muscles:

deadlifts

squats

overhead push

power clean

**Cause #2: Lack of recovery**

Your muscles grow when you sleep. This is because after the exercises your body has to heal the damaged muscle tissues and grow them. If you have high-intensity exercises and you eat correctly but don’t recover this can definitely cause inability to gain muscle mass. The best way is to improve your recovery.

Additionally, if you undergo high amounts of stress, this will cause your body to produce too much cortisol (stress-regulating hormone). Cortisol could break down your muscle tissues and turn them into blood sugar.

**Remedies:**

- Sleep 8 to 9 hrs per day (take naps if needed)

- Let your muscles recover fully before training the same muscles again

- Consume potassium (4,700 mg / day)

- Consume more vitamin B1:

• nutritional yeast

• benfotiamine

- Avoid things and people that stress you out

- Take long walks outside daily (at least 45 minutes).

**Cause #3: Low amounts of human growth hormone and testosterone**

There are two main hormones that help us grow and retain muscles. These are testosterone and human growth hormone. If you lack these hormones it can result in muscle loss and inability to grow it.

Human growth hormone (HGH) is an anti-aging hormone. It burns fat as well as building muscles and regenerating the body. The best way to increase HGH is to do intermittent fasting and high-intensity full body training.

Testosterone is a male hormone that is also needed for women in smaller amounts. Having normal amounts of testosterone in addition to exercises can build your muscles. One way to improve testosterone is by avoiding things that cause it to go low.

**Remedies:**

- Increase human growth hormone by doing these things:

    - do intermittent fasting

    - consume 7 to 8 oz of protein per meal

    - improve sleep

- Increase testosterone by doing the following:

    - consume more cholesterol (helps to make testosterone)

    - consume moderate amounts of protein (6 to 8 oz in meal)

    - consume zinc (100 mg / day)

- consume korean red ginseng

- take L-arginine

- take D-aspartic acid

- consume cruciferous vegetables (natural estrogen blockers)

- consume DIM (concentrated cruciferous)

- consume white button mushrooms

- consume mushrooms in general

- consume celery

- consume parsley

- consume olive oil

**Cause #4: Insulin resistance**

Consuming a lot of refined carbs and sugars will spike your insulin high in order to lower the blood sugar level that results. Eventually your cells become resistant to insulin. The connection between insulin resistance and lack of muscle growth requires an understanding of insulin.

Insulin acts like a key to the cells, allowing them to absorb vital nutrients. If your cells are resistant to insulin they don’t absorb protein well, causing slow muscle growth or inability to grow muscle.

If you do the Healthy Keto® diet as well as an intermittent fasting plan your body cells will be less resistant to insulin--allowing them to absorb more protein and therefore grow more muscle mass.

**Other causes:**

- Avoid snacking (spikes insulin)

- Avoid refined carbs and sugar

- Do the Healthy Keto® diet

- Do intermittent fasting

- Keep your carbs under 50 g/day

- Consume moderate amounts of protein (6 to 8 oz per meal)

## What Factors Contribute To The Presence Of An Ammonia Odor During Ketosis

# What factors contribute to the presence of an ammonia odor during ketosis?

Ammonia is a chemical byproduct of protein metabolism. When your digestive system functions normally, ammonia converts to less toxic byproducts. If you have excess ammonia levels, it means that something is not functioning right. As a result you may develop a strong ammonia body odor that comes out in your breath, urine, or sweat.

**Cause #1: Acidosis**

An ammonia odor can be caused by acidosis. Acidosis occurs when your body is too acidic. To alkalize the blood, your body can compensate with ammonia, which is highly alkaline. This situation may happen when you’re adapting to ketosis.

**Cause #3: Excess protein consumption**

Sometimes a strong ammonia odor can simply be due to consuming excess protein, because ammonia is a byproduct of protein. Consuming more moderate amounts of protein should help.

## Can A Ketogenic Diet Provide Benefits For Individuals With Alzheimers Disease

# Can a ketogenic diet provide benefits for individuals with Alzheimer's disease?

**Alzheimer’s and ketosis:**

As well as the rest of the human body, our brain runs on fuel. Alzheimer’s disease (whether caused by genetics or brain damage) makes the brain unable to efficiently utilize sugar/carb fuel (glucose), resulting in brain starvation. However, our brains love ketones (fat-burning fuel) more than sugar/carb fuel anyway. Although the damaged brain parts of Alzheimer’s disease patients can’t utilize glucose efficiently, they can successfully utilize ketones.

## What Are The Underlying Factors Contributing To Adrenal Fatigue

# What are the underlying factors contributing to adrenal fatigue?

**Cause #1: Chronic stress**

Chronic stress can cause your adrenal glands to work without rest at producing stress hormones (like cortisol). Over time, chronic stress causes adrenal glands to burn out and not function properly. Therefore, your body can’t handle stress effectively anymore because your cells become resistant to stress hormones being overproduced.

 [See Video/Image/Document](https://hls-player.drberg.com/asset?path=migrated-assets/treating-adrenal-fatigue-with-sleep-most-important-action-for-adrenal-fatigue-drberg)

**Cause #2: Low vitamin B1**

Vitamin B1 (thiamin) is vital for normal functioning of the nervous system and for regulating stress levels in the body. Low vitamin B1 can reduce your ability to handle physical and mental stress. If you are deficient in B1 your adrenal glands can eventually wear out, resulting in the adrenal fatigue symptoms mentioned above.

**Remedies:**

- Take vitamin B1

- nutritional yeast

- benfotiamine

- Avoid alcohol

## What Are The Key Techniques And Approaches For Stroke Recovery And Reh Ceb5F7

# What are the key techniques and approaches for stroke recovery and rehabilitation?

## **Understanding Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Techniques**

[Recovering from a stroke](https://www.drberg.com/blog/what-to-do-after-a-stroke-important) is a complex process that requires a personalized approach. There's no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to stroke rehabilitation.

The most effective strategies involve a multifaceted approach that addresses both brain health and motor recovery. Let's explore some key techniques that can help optimize the stroke recovery process.

### **The Role of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Healing Brain Damage**

[Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-benefits-of-hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy) is a promising treatment for stroke recovery. It involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized chamber, which allows the lungs to gather more oxygen than possible at normal air pressure.

This increased oxygen supply can help heal damaged brain tissue by reducing inflammation, promoting new blood vessels' growth, and stimulating stem cell release.

While more research is needed, HBOT shows potential as a complementary therapy for stroke rehabilitation.

### **Ketones as an Alternative Fuel for Brain Recovery**

The brain typically relies on glucose for energy, but after a stroke, the brain's ability to use glucose may be impaired. This is where ketones come in.

[Ketones](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-t-get-your-ketones-high-enough) are an alternative fuel source for the brain when glucose is unavailable. They can be obtained through a low-carb, high-fat diet, exogenous ketone supplements, [MCT oil](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-15-benefits-of-mct-or-medium-chain-triglyceride-oil), and intermittent fasting.

By providing the brain with an alternative energy source, ketones may help support brain function and recovery after a stroke.

## What Noodles Can I Eat On Keto

# What noodles can I eat on keto?

Konjac noodles are keto-friendly. They are 97% water and 3% fiber. Fiber is a carb, but it doesn’t have any effect on insulin. Other names for konjac noodles are miracle noodles or shirataki noodles.

**This type of fiber can have some interesting effects, including:**

- It may act as a detox

- It may help support weight loss

- It may help loosen mucus

Something to keep in mind about these noodles is that they are flavorless. You’ll have to add things to them to make them flavorful. These noodles do not have the same texture as pasta noodles, but they’re similar. You may also get very thirsty if you consume them.

**Benefits of konjac noodles:**

- They can decrease hunger

- They may help stabilize your blood sugars

- They may help decrease constipation

- They don’t have any calories

**Other keto pasta alternatives:**

- Spaghetti squash

- Zucchini noodles

## How Can I Prevent Muscle Loss Im A Senior.

# How can I prevent muscle loss? I’m a senior.

Sarcopenia, or age-related muscle loss, can worsen due to immobility, nutritional deficiencies, lack of exercise, and certain diseases. To combat it, focus on routine exercise, especially resistance training, and consider supplements like vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, amino acids (especially leucine), and HMB (B-hydroxy B-methylbutyrate).

## Can I Eat Spinach On Keto

# Can I eat spinach on keto?

Most definitely. It’s rich in iron, magnesium, vitamins K and C, folic acid, B2 and B6. It supports the eyes, preventing macular degeneration, and it’s good for inflammation. The health benefits of spinach are huge.

However, spinach has oxalates, which can cause kidney stones.

To counter oxalates, you can steam your spinach, you can add lemon juice and potassium citrate. You can also consume some calcium-rich food together with the spinach (in the same meal, not separately); this will allow calcium to bind with oxalates in your digestive system so they are prevented from forming stones in the kidneys.

Make sure spinach is organic to avoid unwanted chemicals.

## Can I Have Avocado On A Keto Diet

# Can I have avocado on a keto diet?

Yes. Avocados are great to have on the ketogenic diet because they are high in fat, low in carbs, and have hardly any sugar at all.

- The quantity of nutrients in avocado is very high

- An average avocado has between 500 and 800 mg of potassium which is good for energy, blood sugars and the heart

- Potassium is also a physiological relaxer that helps with your sleep and blood pressure

- Avocado contains folate, vitamin C, vitamin K, B vitamins, vitamin E, manganese, magnesium, zinc and vitamin A

- It’s loaded with fat-soluble vitamins which also enhance the absorption of other nutrients

## What Yogurt Can I Eat On Keto

# What yogurt can I eat on keto?

One that’s recommended is a special type of yogurt called Trimona. A few reasons why Trimona is recommended:

- It’s grass-fed

- Its producers use milk from cows that generate A2 protein versus A1 (less allergies)

- It’s organic

- It’s whole fat

- It’s fermented for 30 hours

- It’s not strained

- There are no thickeners or additives

- It’s plain, so it has less sugar

- It’s non-GMO

A serving of Trimona contains:

- 10 g carbs

- 6 g sugar

- 8 g protein

- 8 g fat

Trimona also contains friendly bacteria, including lactobacillus bulgaricus. A few potential benefits of lactobacillus bulgaricus:

- Could help improve lactose intolerance

- Stimulates the immune system

- Supports the liver

- Could help decrease diarrhea

- Could help decrease inflammation in the gut

- Could help decrease constipation

## What Sardines Can I Eat On Keto

# What sardines can I eat on keto?

Always check the package to make sure that your sardines are in olive oil or water. Soybean oil is full of omega-6 fatty acids. This can nullify the benefits of the omega-3 fatty acids naturally found in sardines.

Soybean oil is the most used oil in America today. It’s also the second most used oil in the world.

Soybean oil is used in everything from fast food to animal feed to canned foods.

Research shows that soy oil can induce obesity and diabetes more than fructose. Soybean oil can also contribute to insulin resistance and fatty liver disease.

Soybean oil affects the hypothalamus, reduces oxytocin and influences over 100 genes in the brain.

Because soybean oil is so heavily processed, it acts as a powerful oxidizer, it is estrogenic, and it can induce inflammation–especially in your arteries.

If all of that isn’t bad enough, soybeans are also GMOs. This means they are exposed to the chemical glyphosate.

In summary, make sure that your sardines do not contain soybean oil. Instead, choose sardines in water or olive oil.

## Can I Drink Alcohol On A Ketogenic Diet

# Can I drink alcohol on a ketogenic diet?

It’s not recommended. A lot of people think that alcohol is keto-friendly. They say “I drink hard liquor like whiskey, vodka, brandy, tequila, a dry martini – alcohol has no carbs, it has antioxidants and doesn’t turn to sugar, etc. so it’s okay, right?”

Most people do not drink pure ethanol. They consume beer, wine, mixed drinks and coolers that have added carbs.

Alcohol has 7 calories/gram and carbohydrates have 4 calories/gram. These calories have to go somewhere. Despite the fact that alcohol doesn’t turn into sugar or raise your insulin, the alcohol calories will turn into fat. Within one minute, alcohol is already in your bloodstream, up to your brain and to your liver.

Alcohol is a solvent. Your liver considers it to be a toxin. In the liver you have this enzyme that breaks alcohol down into a highly toxic chemical called acetaldehyde. It acts as a poison, killing brain cells and liver cells, causing oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis – and it leads to a fatty liver that is difficult, even impossible, to reverse.

Alcohol depletes your vitamins, dehydrates you, and blocks fat burning. Additionally, ethanol takes priority over burning fat. The liver focuses on ridding the body of alcohol instead.

There are no health benefits to drinking. It actually increases death. If you are okay with these risks, and understand that alcohol will also slow your weight-loss progress, then at least do not drink frequently, and do things to make up for the damage.

If you need a healthy alcohol substitute, you can consume kombucha tea.

---

## Can I Eat Watermelons On Keto

# Can I eat watermelons on keto?

Yes, in small amounts.

There are two factors you need to know. One is the glycemic index, which is the speed at which your blood sugars are elevated after you eat the food item. The second is the glycemic load, which is a measurement of the quantity of carbohydrate in a given food.

A glycemic load of less than ten is on the low side. Watermelon is four, which is good. But its glycemic index is fairly high at 72. If you consume larger amounts of watermelon (or any food) the glycemic load multiplies. If you eat a small amount of watermelon on a keto diet, you’ll be okay as long as you keep within your net carbs.

If your metabolism is really slow, you want to avoid watermelon and even berries. But if your metabolism is good, you’ll be fine with a little bit of watermelon.

## What Keto Ice Cream Can I Eat On Keto

# What keto ice cream can I eat on Keto?

Let’s look deeper at a few keto ice cream brands. Most of them contain sugar alcohol called erythritol.

- Enlightened – 7 g sugar alcohol (also has regular sugar)

- Keto – 8 g sugar alcohol / tapioca fiber (which is not keto-friendly)

- Rebel – 9 g sugar alcohol

- Halo – 10 g net carbs (contains wheat flour and sugar)

Most of these brands use a sugar alcohol called erythritol. What’s good about erythritol is that it’s zero on the glycemic index. What’s bad about it is that unless it’s non-GMO, it could be made from GMO ingredients. None of the major brands that advertise keto ice cream have stated that their product was non-GMO.

For something to be keto, it needs to be low-carb. But even that is a loose term with no legal definition.

Some of the other ingredients in keto ice cream:

- Dairy – Is it organic?

- Sugar – You don’t want any sugar

- Wheat – You don’t want any wheat

- Tapioca – You don’t want any tapioca

- Egg yolk – Is it organic?

The biggest problem with every single one of these so-called keto-friendly ice cream brands is an ingredient called MPC (milk protein concentrate). Another name for this would be milk protein isolates. MPC is a group of dehydrated proteins that come from milk. It is a combination of casein, whey protein and other proteins. These proteins have been linked to inflammation in the liver. Something many people don’t realize is that almost all milk-protein concentrates are imported from China and Mexico. These imported products are also not regulated.

You can consume keto ice cream, although it is not recommended to consume on a regular basis or in large amounts. Preferably find an organic one without any sugar (sugar alcohol is okay) and without tapioca, flour or MPC.

## Can I Consume Agave Nectar On Keto

# Can I consume agave nectar on keto?

No. Agave nectar is 90% fructose and 10% glucose. It’s not recommended.

Fructose is metabolized very differently in the body compared to glucose. Concentrated fructose puts tremendous stress on the liver because the liver is the only part of the body that can deal with fructose. Where the liver is concerned, metabolizing fructose is almost identical to consuming alcohol.

Fructose can potentially lead to:

- A fatty liver

- Insulin resistance

- Bad cholesterol (high LDL)

- High uric acid (gout)

When you consume fruit, the fiber and nutrients in the fruit help buffer the fructose. This means fruit doesn’t have near the effect that concentrated fructose (like agave nectar) has on the liver.

The main problem with fruit is that it can potentially slow down weight loss.

---

## Can I Eat Salmon On Keto

# Can I eat salmon on keto?

Yes, you can. Wild-caught salmon is one of the best protein/fat sources that you can consume on keto. It has amazing amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, and contains great protein that is easy to digest.

Make sure it is wild-caught (Pacific) and not farm-raised (Atlantic), because the chronic consumption of farm-raised salmon has been proven to dramatically increase visceral fat, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. It has been detected that pesticides, dioxins, and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls, which are highly toxic industrial compounds) in farm-raised salmon were the cause.

Also, an important point is that salmon has a good amount of selenium, a trace mineral involved in the key enzymes that detoxify heavy metals – including mercury. Selenium-based enzymes protect the brain and nervous system.

---

## Can I Consume Berries On Keto

# Can I consume berries on keto?

Yes, in moderate amounts.

Berries are loaded with phytonutrients. These phytonutrients have some really interesting potential health properties.

A few potential health benefits of berries:

- They’re antioxidants

- They can help blood sugars

- They’re high in fiber

- They’re high in vitamin C

- They can help reduce inflammation

The best berries to have on keto (1 cup):

- Strawberry – net carbs 8.1 g, sugar 7 g

- Blueberry – net carbs 17.4 g, sugar 15 g

- Blackberry – net carbs 6 g, sugar 7 g

- Raspberry – net carbs 7 g, sugar 5 g

Dried berries can have as much as 132 g of net carbs and 80 g of sugar per cup. So fresh and frozen berries are keto-friendly, but dried berries are not keto-friendly and should be avoided.

## Can I Consume Coconut Oil On Keto

# Can I consume coconut oil on keto?

Some people are a little nervous about consuming coconut oil, based on false information. By the way, it’s not bad for your heart, nor is it a poison. It’s been used for hundreds of years by many cultures without problems. In fact, there are some cultures whose diet is 60 percent coconut-based, who are quite healthy. Coconut oil will boost HDL, the so-called good cholesterol.

The coconut is the largest seed on earth. It takes 3 years to break the soil it is in, so that the seed can actually grow.

The three significant benefits of coconut oil are:

- Supports your brain. A significant part of coconut oil is what’s called MCTs, or medium chain triglycerides – a type of fat that turns into ketones. Your brain cells love ketones. Ketones protect the nerves and brain cells against stress. They’ve been shown to boost cognitive function and to help people with dementia as well as Alzheimer’s.

- It’s antibacterial and antimicrobial. Its 3 main fatty acids are caprylic, capril and lauric, and they’re responsible for these properties, along with being antifungal, anti-candida, anti- yeast and antiviral. Monolaural, the precursor to lauric acid, has the capacity to dismantle the fatty layer around certain viruses. So it’s beneficial for your immune system.

- Provides you with more energy, because MCT oil doesn’t require digestive enzymes. It gets absorbed directly into your body. You get fatty acids and ketones for fuel, which are much more efficient than glucose. You’ll get more of what’s called ATP, the body’s energy currency, than you do from carbs.

## Can I Consume Olives On A Ketogenic Diet

# Can I consume olives on a ketogenic diet?

Yes you can.

Features of olives:

- High in vitamin E, iron, copper and calcium

- Keto-friendly: 74% oleic acid (monounsaturated fat)

- 4% to 6% carbohydrates, fiber 70%, net carbs 1.5 g per 10 olives

- Phytonutrients: anti-inflammatory, anticancer, good for heart support and repairing liver damage

One of the drawbacks of olives is that they contain lectins, which are large protein molecules that are a defense mechanism in plants, nuts, seeds, etc. They can go into our bodies and create a lot of inflammation. The way to lessen lectins is through fermentation and most olives are fermented.

Olive leaf extract is a good remedy for viruses. It has antihistamine properties which are good for rhinitis or sinus congestion.

---

## Can I Consume Beets On Keto

# Can I consume beets on keto?

Yes. beetroot and beet tops themselves are great for the diet. Although beets contain more sugar than some vegetables, the fiber they contain binds to the sugar, which helps prevent blood sugar spikes.

You can consume beets in your salads and beet tops in your smoothies. They are fantastic for promoting a healthy body.

- Beets are amazing for boosting your liver detoxification process. They help with the enzymes that break down and eliminate toxins. If you have a fatty liver, it’s a good idea to add plenty of beets to your diet.

- Beets can support healthy testosterone levels and estrogen levels.

- Beets promote a healthy cardiovascular system by helping support healthy blood pressure levels.

## Can I Eat Chocolate On Keto Diet

# Can I eat chocolate on Keto diet?

Yes, in small amounts. Always consume chocolate that is organic and doesn’t contain sugar. A couple of brands are Lily’s Sweets and Choc Zero. Cacao and dark chocolate are high in oxalates. So if you’re at risk for kidney stones, you may not want to consume either one.

Potential health benefits of dark chocolate and cacao:

• Decreased blood pressure

• Increased HDL and decreased LDL (especially oxidized LDL)

• Decreased risk of heart disease (decreased endothelial dysfunction)

• Decreased cortisol and adrenaline

• Decreased risk of certain cancers

• Decreased insulin (may improve insulin resistance)

• Decreased risk of strokes

• Better mood and increased serotonin (it can act as an antidepressant)

• Increased physical performance

• Increased skin circulation, texture, hydration

• Decreased metabolic syndrome

## Can I Consume Rice On Keto

# Can I consume rice on keto?

**Not really. Different types of rice and their features:**

**White rice**

• No hull, no bran, no germ (pure carbohydrate)

• Glycemic index: 77

• It’s enriched with synthetic vitamins – B1, B2, B3, folic acid, iron

One of the problems with consuming white rice is that you’re at risk of potentially developing a condition called Beri Beri (vitamin B1 deficiency). This is a neurological disease that can create all sorts of problems with the nerves, pulse rate, memory and blood sugars.

**Brown rice**

• Has no hull

• Has bran and germ (less refined)

• Glycemic index: 68 Wild rice

• It has the hull, the bran and the germ

• It has a lot more nutrition than other rice types

• Glycemic index: 52

## Can I Eat Hummus On Keto Diet

# Can I eat hummus on Keto diet?

Yes you can. It’s an amazing combination of six ingredients:

1\. Olive oil has anti-inflammatory properties, supports the heart, and contains vitamin C.

2\. Lemon helps prevent the formation of kidney stones and contains vitamin C.

3\. Garlic is an antimicrobial.

4\. Sea salt has 75 minerals.

5\. Chickpeas (garbanzo beans), low on the glycemic index, help improve insulin resistance.

6\. Tahini has omega-3. And high methionine, an insoluble fiber that can support the gallbladder and counteract gray hair and depression.

Also, the fat from the olive oil and tahini buffer any type of spike in insulin.

## Why Can I Not Quit Chocolate

# Why can I not quit chocolate?

Chocolate contains over 380 chemicals, with three main ones creating pleasure sensations:

1\. **Phenylalanine**: Builds dopamine, enhancing mood, and producing endorphins for euphoria. Also increases noradrenaline for alertness.

2\. **Theobromine**: Similar to caffeine, it boosts mental clarity, acts as a diuretic and vasodilator. Not ideal if you have liver issues as it may disrupt sleep due to slower clearance.

3\. **Tryptophan**: Precursor to serotonin, promoting calmness, reducing stress, and lifting mood. Often consumed when feeling down.

Enjoy chocolate in moderation, preferably sugar-free with sweeteners like erythritol, stevia, or monk fruit. Avoid consuming it late in the day to prevent sleep disturbances.

## What Are The Potential Reasons For A Slow Metabolism

# What are the potential reasons for a slow metabolism?

Various factors can contribute to metabolic issues, including aging, menopause, pregnancy, dieting, high-carb diets, chronic stress, hypothyroidism, fatty liver, obesity, snacking, alcohol consumption, early childhood infection, and certain medications.

---

## Is It Possible To Stop Snacking

# Is it possible to stop snacking?

The snacking and grazing cycle can lead to fluctuations in blood sugar and insulin levels, potentially contributing to insulin resistance over time. Here's what to consider:

1\. Eating in response to emotions like depression, fatigue, boredom, or stress can exacerbate these feelings and perpetuate the snacking cycle.

2\. Constantly consuming carbohydrates for pleasure may lead to dopamine resistance, impacting mood regulation.

3\. Mindless eating, such as eating out of habit or availability, can keep you trapped in the snacking cycle.

4\. Fasting, when done correctly, can help break this cycle by promoting the body's use of stored fat for energy, leading to reduced hunger and cravings.

5\. Proper fasting may result in improved mood, cognitive function, and overall well-being.

6\. Strategies to break the snacking cycle include skipping breakfast, understanding the relationship between eating and hunger, avoiding junk foods, staying physically active, and minimizing carb intake during meals.

## Is Yacon Syrup Keto Friendly And Safe To Consume

# Is Yacon syrup keto-friendly and safe to consume?

It is definitely not keto-friendly! Though certain people will say that you can have it on keto and that it will help you lose weight, they are way off with this one. Yacon syrup is extracted from the roots of the yacon plant in Peru.

50% of yacon is made up of FOS, or fructooligosaccharide, which is a prebiotic fiber. If you use yacon and you have any problem with candida, SIBO, leaky gut, or any gut inflammation, you’re going to feel bloated.

30% of yacon is fructose sugar. Fructose can overwhelm the liver and lead to insulin resistance and a fatty liver. There was a study that showed that yacon could help you lose weight. However, this was based on a low-fat / low-calorie diet, which is not best for your health. Overall, yacon will spike your blood sugars enough to throw your body out of ketosis and stop fat burning. There are better sweetener alternatives, like allulose, monkfruit, swerve, stevia. Try those instead.

## What Factors Might Explain Why You Feel Worse After Consuming Meat

# What factors might explain why you feel worse after consuming meat?

**There are several reasons why it can happen. Let’s take a look at two:**

1\. You may not have enough hydrochloric acid in your stomach to digest the protein. This is a common problem and it’s easy to fix. All you need to do is to take some betaine hydrochloride and apple cider vinegar before your meal. This will help increase your stomach’s acidity so you can properly digest red meat. Many people have this problem as they get older.

2\. If you feel bad after eating red meat, it could stem from too much iron. While iron is essential for a healthy body, too much can be a problem. The thing is, our bodies don’t have
a natural mechanism to get rid of iron. If you are not on keto and consume grains, this can increase iron in the body drastically. If you have too much iron you can develop problems that include liver issues, headaches, joint pain, fatigue and insomnia.

---

## Why Do I Feel Nauseous On Keto

# Why do I feel nauseous on Keto?

This is usually a sign of liver or gallbladder problems. Try to consume purified bile salts and see if that helps.

Also, various kinds of sugar alcohol could cause digestive problems. Try to cut back on them and only use a small amount.

Adjust the vegetables you eat; maybe you need to switch to different ones due to sensitivity. You can consume fermented vegetables in this case as it may help.

Avoid dextrose and maltodextrin.

Sometimes people add too many fats on a ketogenic diet without getting used to the quantity gradually. This can cause nausea as well.

## What Are The Best Snack Foods For Low Blood Sugar

# What are the best snack foods for low blood sugar?

A person with low blood sugar might be accustomed to snacks like protein bars and an apple with peanut butter. There is so much hidden sugar in these snacks that such snacks are nor recommended; with them, every time you snack you are worsening the problem of low blood sugar. You can become a real hypoglycemic which is almost a pre-diabetic situation. Normal blood sugars are between 80 to 90, but not over 100.

When you eat a snack, no matter what you snack on, you elevate your sugars. Once the sugar goes high it triggers the hormone insulin to drive the sugar down, so you end up with a low blood sugar situation. Snacking keeps the blood sugar levels going up and down, up and down, and perpetuates the problem.

The way out of this is to change what you eat at your meals. Watch Dr. Eric Berg’s videos about the Healthy Keto® and intermittent fasting plan; this diet will help you keep your blood sugars under control.

## What Health Benefits Does Consuming Macadamia Nuts Offer Considering T A2C77D

# What health benefits does consuming macadamia nuts offer, considering their nutritional profile and physiological impact?

Macadamia nuts have a great amount of fat, a low amount of carbs and a lower amount of protein. Macadamia has more fat than any other nut and can be beneficial for the keto diet.

**Benefits**

- High in fat

- Low in carbs

- High in nutrition

    - omega-7 fatty acids

    - vitamin B1

- vitamin B6

- copper

- manganese

- magnesium

- iron

**How to consume them**

Having a small handful of macadamia nuts right after a meal could help you feel more satisfied.

**Where to get them**

You can get them at a grocery store. You really want to make sure you buy fresh macadamia nuts. They are toxic to dogs, so keep that in mind.

## Will Vegetables Slow Down Ketosis

# Will vegetables slow down ketosis?

They will not, especially if you avoid things like corn, carrots and potatoes. If you eliminate those you don’t have to worry about the vegetable part of your diet slowing down ketosis.

Most ketogenic diets recommend 20 to 50 g of carbs per day without differentiating the types of carbohydrates. Dr Berg recommends that you get those carbs from your vegetable sources.

## Can I Do Keto Even If I Dont Like Vegetables

# Can I do keto even if I don’t like vegetables?

Not healthily, and here’s why.

The problem is that you will be burning a lot of fat, and you need to keep the fat going through the liver and gallbladder. Vegetables are going to provide you with needed nutrients and they are going to help organs like the liver to work better.

Dr. Berg recommends 7 to 10 cups of vegetables a day. Without vegetables it will be hard to flush out those organs.

If you aren’t in love with veggies you can try kale shakes with added berries to hide the taste, or take wheatgrass juice; you can use dips, fermented veggies, green powders, food concentrates, steamed spinach with protein, etc.

Health benefits from consuming a lot of vegetables will support your body while in ketosis and will prevent any potential keto side effects.

## What Happens When I Overeat

# What happens when I overeat?

Overeating can lead to increased stress on the digestive system, causing gas, bloating, nausea, and constipation. Regularly elevated insulin levels can result in insulin resistance (prediabetes) and an overworked pancreas. Poor digestion and excess food intake can also decrease sleep quality and cause the body to convert surplus food to body fat. The following day, you may experience increased cravings, moodiness, inflammation, and a slowed metabolism.

## Is Depression A Disease

# Is depression a disease?

Depression is a mental state. When someone is depressed you can’t take an x-ray to see depression or a blood test to see depression. Depression is subjective. Diseases are objective and they are diagnosed based on some medical test. Depression as an emotion is real and can be caused by many things – like vitamin D deficiency, for example. Also, a lack of sleep can cause chronic fatigue, which can mimic depression.

**\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.**

## Why Does Fasting Lower Your Thyroid Hormone T3 A Little Bit

# Why does fasting lower your thyroid hormone T3 a little bit?

Sometimes, going on a fast can lower a thyroid hormone called T3. This is the active form of the thyroid hormone. 

The pituitary communicates to the thyroid through a hormone called the thyroid stimulating hormone. One of the main ways hypothyroidism is diagnosed is by looking at the thyroid stimulating hormone. When you’re fasting and doing the healthy keto diet, you won’t see a change in the thyroid stimulating hormone. So, you are not going to have a true hypothyroid condition. 

The thyroid releases T4, which is the inactive form of the thyroid hormone. To become activated, it has to work through the liver and into the kidney. It converts from T4 to T3 (the active form). There is also something called reverse T3, which is the inactive version of T3. What determines the rate and ratio of this conversion of T4 to T3 or reverse T3 is the metabolic need. 

When you do a fast, you may see a slight decrease in T3. But, you will see an increase in the reverse T3. You’re body is becoming more efficient with its fuel, so the need for the active form of the thyroid hormone is going to be slightly less. The body will then put some of that hormone into a reserve until you need it.

## What Mechanisms Explain How Elevated Cortisol Levels Can Lead To Weight Gain

# What mechanisms explain how elevated cortisol levels can lead to weight gain?

Cortisol increases your energy in stressful situations by converting energy into sugar. However, when this energy isn't used—such as in a sedentary job—it gets stored as fat. Worse, cortisol can convert muscle into sugar, reducing muscle mass. Additionally, cortisol prevents fat burning, making it difficult to achieve ketosis. To manage cortisol effectively, identify and reduce sources of stress. Follow a Healthy Keto® diet and practice intermittent fasting. Ensure you get plenty of vitamin D, vitamin C, and potassium to support overall health.

## What Are The Primary Risk Factors And Underlying Causes Of Breast Cancer

# What are the primary risk factors and underlying causes of breast cancer?

**Two Common Triggers of Breast Disease:**

• Excessive Amounts of Estrogen

Recommendation: High-Quality Source Sea Kelp and Cruciferous Vegetables Avoid Soy/GMO Products and Go Organic

• High Levels of Insulin – It can make the cells grow, divide and multiply

Recommendation: Do Ketogenic Diet and Intermittent Fasting Sugar and Refined Carbohydrates trigger insulin

**Mammograms**

• Mammograms can be traumatic because you are putting the breast on the plate and you are creating compression.

• Inflammatory Oncotaxis – a term that describes a condition where cells travel in the areas of inflammation in trauma. They use Ionizing Radiation, these little wave particles that go through and disrupt the electrons and certain molecules in your cells.

\*The above information is not intended for diagnosis. If you have any health concerns you should consult your physician.

## What Are Some Effective Natural Alternatives To Adderall For Enhancing 01Cb06

# What are some effective natural alternatives to Adderall for enhancing focus and cognitive function without the use of pharmaceuticals?

There is an interesting natural adderall alternative that has virtually no side effects. It’s called Mucuna Pruriens or velvet bean. Mucuna Pruriens increases L-dopa, which turns into dopamine (a body chemical that triggers feelings of pleasure).

**Benefits**

- Increases focus and concentration

- Decreases brain fog

- Increases ability to learn

- Increases memory

- Increases mood

- Decreases stress

- Neuroprotective

**How to consume it**

You may want to cycle consumption of this substance by taking it for four days in a row and then not taking it for three days in a row or so forth. Follow the directions on the label for the proper dosage.

If you are trying to substitute velvet bean for adderall, consult with your medical doctor prior to undertaking it.

It will work a lot better if you also correct your diet by doing Healthy Keto® and intermittent fasting. Mucuna pruriens may help with symptoms, but you really want to correct the root cause of brain fog and lack of focus by fixing your diet.

**Where to get it**

You can get it at a health food store or order it online.

## What Factors Related To The Menstrual Cycle May Contribute To Hair Loss

# What factors related to the menstrual cycle may contribute to hair loss?

On day 15, when you’re ovulating, you get a huge spike in estrogen. In the next two weeks, you’re going to get a huge spike in progesterone and androgens.

The time of the month you’re losing your hair can give us clues as to which hormone is involved. Most women tend to lose hair during the second half of the menstrual cycle when there is a spike in androgens. But, even a female in menopause may continue to lose their hair to some degree.

**If you’re pre-menopause** and you’re experiencing hair loss in the second half of your cycle, you may need to lower your androgens. The best way to lower your androgens is to lower your insulin. You can lower your insulin by lowering your carbohydrates. You would want to go on the Healthy keto diet and do intermittent fasting.

**If you’re post-menopausal** and your hair is falling out, you may be low in progesterone, androgens, and estrogen. In this situation, taking DHEA may be beneficial. But be sure to only take a small amount (10-30mg a day), or it may have an opposite effect causing hair loss.

What if you’re postpartum and you’re experiencing hair loss because of a severe drop in estrogen? In this case, 10mg of DHEA may help. For PCOS, your androgens are too high. In this situation, you could try doing keto and intermittent fasting, as well as taking inositol.

For a heavy period, you would not want to take DHEA. Instead, you can try taking DIM and get plenty of iron. It’s possible to have a slow thyroid because of an increase in estrogen. In this situation, DIM may be beneficial as well as bile salts and selenium.

If you’re losing your hair after you stopped taking birth control pills, this could be from a decrease in estrogen. Taking inositol may be a great remedy in this case.

**Two additional causes of hair loss to keep in mind are:**

1\. A trace mineral deficiency

2\. A B vitamin deficiency

## What Are The Most Effective And Scientifically Supported Strategies Fo C7175D

# What are the most effective and scientifically supported strategies for addressing and mitigating Candida overgrowth in the body?

A good portion of the microbes in your gut are fungi, and candida is one type of fungi. Friendly fungi support the body in many different ways. It’s not until we change the environment that our friendly bacteria and fungi live in that they can become a problem. For example, one of the biggest side effects of antibiotics is candida overgrowth.

If the ratio of candida to bacteria is incorrect, this can lead to health issues. But bacteria release certain things to help keep candida in check. If candida does turn unfriendly, you need to know what you can do. One important thing to remember to support a healthy microbiome is to take probiotics if you have to take antibiotics.

**The best candida home remedies:**

1\. Take a probiotic and consume probiotic foods

2\. Avoid sugar and dairy

3\. Avoid carbs (do Healthy Keto®)

4\. Avoid sugar alcohols

5\. Consume capric acid (coconut oil or MCT oil)

6\. Consume vegetable fiber

7\. Consume natural herbal antibiotics (garlic, oregano oil, thyme, sage, or turmeric)

## How Will Fasting Affect Diabetes

# How will fasting affect diabetes?

**The difference between type-1 and type-2 diabetes is that type-1 diabetes is characterized by a lack of insulin due to pancreatic damage.**

Type-2 diabetes is characterized by a lack of insulin sensitivity. When you have insulin resistance, your body creates far too much insulin. However, this insulin isn't effective because your insulin receptors can't pull in the insulin. Over time, type-2 diabetes can exhaust the pancreas, causing a reduction in inulin production. In turn, some severe types of type-2 diabetes may require insulin shots.

**Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) has similar side effects as high insulin. Both can cause damage to your nerves and blood vessels—especially in your eyes, kidneys, arteries, heart, and brain.**

An interesting study on three people found that fasting has the potential to reverse insulin resistance and restore insulin's effects on blood sugar levels. All three patients were able to stop taking insulin. Two of the three patients were able to eliminate all medications, and the other patient eliminated 3 out of 4 medications. These results seem to be due to the fact that lowering your consumption of carbs lowers your need for insulin. Keto and intermittent fasting combined may decrease the need for insulin even further. Make sure you do not stop taking your prescription medications without your doctor's approval. Work with your doctor to get healthier by doing keto and intermittent fasting.

## Im Feeling Weak And Fainting After 20 Hours Of Fasting   What Do I Do

# I'm feeling weak and fainting after 20 hours of fasting - what do I do?

**Realize this: you’re going from glucose metabolism to running on ketones and fatty acids, which takes time. And it will take a lot longer if you already have diabetes or insulin resistance. It could take months.**

Let’s say you’re at two meals. Your first meal is at 2pm and your second at 6pm, then you fast for twenty hours. If you’re having a hard time with this schedule, and you feel weak and faint, back up a little to eighteen hours of fasting. Eat at 12pm and 6pm. You haven’t given your body enough time to adapt. You want to let how you feel dictate how quickly you should go from, say, thirteen hours or so of fasting, eating three meals per day at 7am, 12pm, and 6pm. If you feel good, then go to eighteen, and then when you feel good, to twenty.

When you’re at three meals per day, avoid snacks and add more fat to your meals until you’re comfortable and your cravings go away. You also want to feel energetic and have good cognitive function.

**Fainting and feeling weak could be low sodium. Make sure you’re consuming at least one teaspoon of sea salt per day. If you’re exercising you may need a teaspoon and a half. You may also need to increase your B vitamins, especially B1, as well as your electrolytes: potassium and magnesium. Your B vitamins and electrolytes are involved in your metabolism, which helps you to make energy so if you're not taking them that could be why you feel weak and faint. You can add MCT oil to your diet, which gives you more ketones to run on.**

You may not be able to get into ketosis without some help if your insulin resistance is severe enough. Other people are using my fasting tea, which seems to help because it has certain phytonutrients to help their blood sugar.

The main point is to reduce your fasting window if you’re feeling weak and faint after twenty hours of intermittent fasting then gradually increase it.

## Does Intermittent Fasting Affect Eyes And Vision

# Does intermittent fasting affect eyes and vision?

Diabetes is a major cause of poor vision, affecting the kidneys, heart, nervous system, and eyes, and can lead to diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, macular degeneration, and cataracts. These eye issues stem from insulin resistance, so addressing this can improve eyesight. Intermittent fasting is effective for reducing insulin resistance, normalizing blood sugar, and promoting autophagy, which helps clean up damaged proteins in the eyes. If vision worsens initially on keto and intermittent fasting, it indicates your body needs more time to adapt.

## Why Do Low Blood Sugars Occur On Keto

# Why do low blood sugars occur on Keto?

**When I look deeper at this problem there are 3 things I see often:**

1\. Not doing it correctly not enough vegetables, proteins, or even fat.

2\. Not doing it consistently. Instead, they are "sort of" doing it.

3\. They do not do it long enough for it to work. This can create lots of mood issues - irritability and moody. In other words, you have to do it correctly, long enough to fully keto adapt.

## Are Celery And Nut Butter Good On Keto

# Are celery and nut butter good on Keto?

Absolutely, yes! Celery and nut butter can be a good alternative to salad for some people. It’s hard for some people to consume the amount of salad that they need, but eating celery with peanut butter is easier. 

The peanut butter or nut butter should be organic and shouldn’t have any added sugar. There also shouldn’t be any extra oils in the peanut butter other than peanut oil. If you do choose celery with peanut butter instead of salad, you may want to consume a good amount of it.  Celery is low carb, but high fiber. Fiber is a carb, but it doesn’t affect your blood sugar. 

**A few celery nutrition facts:**

• Starch—0 

• Potassium (per cup of celery)—262mg

• Sodium (per cup of celery)— 80mg

**A few benefits of celery with nut butter:**

1\. An alternative to salad

2\. It can help pH and reduce the risk of gout

3\. It can help reduce hunger (because of the fat in the nut butter)

4\. It can help lower stress 

5\. It can help a person sleep

6\. It can help support healthy blood pressure levels

## How Much Is Too Much Fat On Keto

# How much is too much fat on Keto?

This is a balance of enough versus too much and getting your sweet spot (no pun intended).

If you have hypoglycemia (low blood sugars) you will need a bit more to go from one meal to the next. However, you also need to make sure you do not have too much, thus overloading the gallbladder and causing (bloating, right shoulder pain, etc). Also, if you consume too much fat, esp. between meals or after meals, you will end up burning dietary fat and NOT your own fat despite being in ketosis.

This is why I recommend always doing intermittent fasting with ketosis. So in other words - you'll have to adjust your fats until it's just right - no gallbladder issues, but allowing you to go from one meal to the next. If you are new to this, you may want to get my booklet or even my bigger book either on the website - drberg.com or amazon. On my website - you can get both as a discount, but not on amazon.

## How Much Alcohol Will Stop Weight Loss And Ketosis

# How much alcohol will stop weight loss and ketosis?

Depending on how much alcohol you drink, it can literally block fat burning for two days or more and most alcohol has added carbohydrates.

**Ethanol: 7 cal/grams**

• It does not spike the insulin directly.

• It is not stored in the body

• It has to be removed by enzymes made by the liver.

• It is highly oxidative (it creates a lot of stress in the liver) – it also causes inflammation that could lead to cirrhosis and a fatty liver.

• The body considers it a toxin.

• It BLOCKS fat burning. \*if there’s alcohol in the body, it is going to stop burning the fat and it switches focus to the danger situation through the use of enzymes.

## How To Choose Protein Correctly On Keto

# How to choose protein correctly on Keto?

In nature, protein never comes as a complete protein—it comes with fat. There is something called the insulin index, which looks at the protein effect on insulin. The leaner the protein, the higher the spike in insulin. You would want to consume fattier proteins and avoid lean proteins to get into deeper ketosis.

The calories in your keto diet should consist of about 10% carbs (5% of your carbs should be from vegetables), 20% protein, and 70% fat. This is about 3.5 times more fat than protein. But, really, we have to look at the weight because there is more condensed energy in fat than protein. Now, we’re looking at 1.56g of fat and 1g of protein. Having a higher fat to protein ratio can have many benefits.

**A closer look at fat to protein ratios:**

Egg: (add fat) Fat — 1 Protein — 1

Hamburger: Fat — 2 Protein — 1

Steak: (add fat) Fat — 1 Protein — 2

Chicken: (eat the skin on the chicken) Fat — 1 Protein — 2

Bacon: (add fat) Fat — 1 Protein — 1

Pecans: (a tiny bit of carbs) Fat — 7 Protein — 1

Peanuts: (a tiny bit of carbs) Fat — 2 Protein — 1

Cod liver: Fat — 5 Protein — 1

Summer sausage: Fat — 2 Protein — 1

Macadamia nuts: Fat — 11.5 Protein — 1

Sardines: Fat — 1 Protein — 2

Salmon: Fat — 1.5 Protein — 1

## When Should You Consider Lowering Your Dietary Fat Intake On A Ketogenic Diet

# When should you consider lowering your dietary fat intake on a ketogenic diet?

A high-fat diet is only bad if you are also consuming a lot of carbs. Keep in mind that the keto diet is not primarily a high-fat diet—it’s a low-carb diet. A diet that is high in fat and high in carbs is not a keto diet. I’ve also found that low-carb and low-fat diets are hard on the liver (especially with lean protein), which causes a lot of digestive issues.

You may want to lower your fat temporarily if you have gallbladder issues or a bile deficiency. Bile is vital to fat digestion. Taking purified bile salts, choline, or lipase can help with fat digestion. Another reason why you may want to lower your fat is if you’ve been on keto and your weight has plateaued. In this case, you can lower your fat to 75 grams per day. This will allow your body to tap into your own fat reserves.

## What Are The Most Important Benefits Of Coconut Oil

# What are the most important benefits of coconut oil?

It’s been used for hundreds of years by many cultures without problems. In fact, there are some cultures whose diet is 60 percent coconut-based, which is quite healthy. (Side note: coconut oil will boost HDL, the so-called good cholesterol.)

The coconut is the largest seed on earth. It takes 3 years to break down the soil it's in, so that it can grow.

**The three significant benefits of coconut oil are:**

● Supports your brain. A significant amount of coconut oil is what’s called MCT, or medium-chain triglycerides. This is a type of fat that turns into ketones. Your brain cells love ketones. They protect the nerves and brain cells against stress. They’ve been shown to boost cognitive function, and help people with dementia as well as Alzheimer’s.

● It’s antibacterial and antimicrobial. Its 3 main fatty acids are caprylic, capril, and lauric, and they’re responsible for these properties, along with being antifungal, anti-candida, anti-yeast, and antiviral. Monolaurin, the precursor to lauric acid, has the capacity to dismantle the fatty layer around certain viruses. So it’s beneficial for your immune system.

● Provides you more energy, because MCT oil doesn’t require digestive enzymes. It gets absorbed directly into your body. You get fatty acids and ketones for fuel, which are much more efficient than glucose. You’ll get more of what’s called ATP, the body’s energy than you do from carbs.

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies Or Therapeutic Interventions Fo Acdd03

# What are the most effective strategies or therapeutic interventions for managing and alleviating the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)?

One theory is that too much testosterone can cause an enlarged prostate. This is false. In fact, your risk of an enlarged prostate increases with age, and you also have less testosterone (DHT) as you age. High estrogen is the real cause of an enlarged prostate.

Testosterone and estrogen oppose each other. So when you have high estrogen, your testosterone levels lower.

The most common reasons for high estrogen are consuming foods high in estrogen, adrenal fatigue, and having too much body fat.

**The best ways to reduce estrogen are:**

• Get on healthy keto to reduce your body fat

• Consume cruciferous vegetables

• Avoid estrogenic foods (GMOs, foods with added hormones, soy, etc.)

• Sea kelp

• Stinging nettle root (to reduce aromatase, which converts testosterone into estrogen)

## Why Does Protein Help With Low Blood Sugar

# Why does protein help with low blood sugar?

With hypoglycemia, insulin lowers high blood sugar, often too much, resulting in low blood sugar. This happens because people with hypoglycemia have high insulin levels and lack counteracting hormones. While glucose, fat, and ketones are common fuels, protein can also be converted into glucose via gluconeogenesis, providing energy and helping stabilize blood sugar.

Consuming protein helps balance blood sugar by stimulating both insulin and glucagon, unlike carbohydrates, which can cause a temporary spike followed by a drop. We recommend adopting a Healthy Keto® diet and intermittent fasting for those with hypoglycemia.

## What Are The Most Effective Strategies For Significantly Boosting And  6E48Af

# What are the most effective strategies for significantly boosting and sustaining energy levels?

**Coffee doesn't give you energy. I**t gets rid of the fatigue molecule so that you don’t feel tired. Glucose and sugar might seem to give you an energy boost, but they actually make you tired!

**Here are 7 ways to raise your energy levels naturally without a crash.**

**1\. Magnesium**

Magnesium is a cofactor to make ATP, which is like the battery source for the body. The #1 symptom of low magnesium is fatigue. Magnesium-rich foods include spinach, almonds, avocado, and fish.

**2\. Sodium-potassium pump**

The sodium-potassium pump in your cells allows you to generate an electrical charge that powers your muscles and your nervous system. Adequate sodium and potassium intake is crucial for healthy energy levels. Electrolyte powder can help if you’re not consuming enough sodium and potassium from your diet.

**3\. Mitochondrial biogenesis**

Creating more mitochondria through consistent exercise can boost energy levels. Fasting, intermittent fasting, cold therapy, and polyphenols can also increase mitochondria. Polyphenols are found in certain vegetables, herbs, berries, and dark chocolate.

**4\. Ketones**

If you follow a keto diet, you can get your body running on ketones. Ketones produce more energy than glucose.

**5\. Carnitine**

Carnitine is a compound that can help transport fat into the mitochondria. Carnitine helps increase exercise endurance, delays the fatigue factor, and acts as an antioxidant to decrease damage in the muscles. Red meat is the best source of carnitine.

**6\. Apple cider vinegar**

Apple cider vinegar can be used by the mitochondria as fuel. Add one tablespoon to a glass of water each day.

**7\. B vitamins**

B vitamins are intimately involved with every part of your mitochondria that generates ATP from your food. Nutritional yeast is one of the best sources of B vitamins.

## Is It Possible To Regulate Blood Sugar Levels Without Consuming Sugar

# Is it possible to regulate blood sugar levels without consuming sugar?

When you are eating sugars and carbs often, your body and brain use glucose as it's main form of energy. But the body can also convert foods into ketones, which serve as an excellent source of energy for both the brain and body. If you want to control your blood sugar levels without eating sugar, try switching to a low-carb diet like Healthy Keto® as this will reduce insulin spikes while also ensuring you have plenty of energy.

## How Does Prolonged High Blood Sugar Impact Nerve Health

# How does prolonged high blood sugar impact nerve health?

Suffering from sustained high blood sugar can cause damage to your motor or sensory nerves. The condition is called peripheral neuropathy. You can also have problems with the autonomic nerves and even the nerves to the eye. High blood sugar can also affect the blood vessels that innervate your nerves.

Taking more B-vitamins in the form of nutritional yeast supports the myelin sheath around the nerves. In addition, switching to a low carb diet like Healthy Keto® can be helpful in negating the side-effects of high blood sugar on the nerves.

## What Are Some Less Obvious Factors That Can Contribute To High Blood Pressure

# What are some less obvious factors that can contribute to high blood pressure?

9 reasons your blood sugar may be high:

1\. Cortisol: A morning cortisol spike can raise blood sugar.

2\. Low Blood Sugar: Hormonal overcompensation for low blood sugar can lead to high blood sugar.

3\. Late-Night Snacks: Carb-rich snacks can increase blood sugar.

4\. Previous Day's Sugar: Sugar consumed the day before can affect blood sugar the next day.

5\. Low Blood Pressure: Medications for low blood pressure can raise blood glucose.

6\. Stress: Stress and anxiety can elevate cortisol and blood sugar.

7\. Missed Meds: Forgetting medications can disrupt blood sugar levels.

8\. Nighttime Exercise: Exercising late may cause your body to overcompensate.

9\. Additives: MSG and artificial sweeteners can spike blood sugar. Addressing insulin resistance with healthy keto and intermittent fasting may help.

## Is Apple Cider Vinegar Effective Against Blood Sugar Problems

# Is apple cider vinegar effective against blood sugar problems?

If you have blood sugar issues, adding apple cider vinegar (ACV) to your diet can be highly beneficial. The acetic acid in ACV provides a potent anti-glycemic effect, helping to lower the glycemic index of the foods you eat. This can stabilize blood sugar and insulin levels, leading to reduced insulin production. Lower insulin levels can help decrease liver fat, promote weight loss, and reduce hunger and cravings.

## What Are Some Natural And Effective Methods To Enhance The Production  Dd7E57

# What are some natural and effective methods to enhance the production of Human Growth Hormone (HGH)?

Sprinting is an explosive form of HIIT and has the potential to drastically increase human growth hormone.

**Sprinting can be described as a short bout of full-speed running. Sprinting puts your body under maximum stress, but only for a short amount of time. Try sprinting for about 20 to 30 seconds at a time with 90 seconds of rest in between your sprints, working up to 8 sprints.**

Sprinting can be twice as effective as injecting human growth hormone. If you also decrease your stress levels, increase your sleep quality, and do keto and intermittent fasting, you can really boost HGH naturally.

**To best stimulate human growth hormone, you’ll want to do a short-duration, high-intensity workout with lots of rest. Growth hormone is stimulated by high-intensity exercise but decreases with the duration of exercise. If you have any issues like knee problems that may inhibit your ability to sprint, you can do this same type of exercise on a bicycle or while swimming.**

## What Factors Contribute To Elevated Blood Sugar Levels In The Morning

# What factors contribute to elevated blood sugar levels in the morning?

This condition, known as the dawn phenomenon, can affect those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or severe insulin resistance. Elevated morning blood sugar can be caused by:

1\. Cortisol spike: Peaks between 6 and 9 am, increasing glucose production.

2\. Type 1 diabetes: Growth hormone spikes can raise blood sugar.

3\. Type 2 diabetes: The liver produces glucose, and hormones like glucagon and epinephrine may elevate blood sugar.

4\. Evening carbs: Consuming high-carb meals the night before.

To manage high morning blood sugar, try adhering to a healthy ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. Exercising, avoiding carbs at night, and drinking diluted apple cider vinegar before bed can all help as well.

## How Can I Determine Whether My Dietary Supplements Include Maltodextri Eb8B0F

# How can I determine whether my dietary supplements include maltodextrin as an ingredient?

**Iodine mixed with water is a golden color. If you combine iodine with starch, it turns blue. When you add iodine to bread, for example, it turns blue. Or, if you put maltodextrin in water and add a few drops of iodine, the water will turn blue.**

**My brand of electrolyte powder doesn’t have any sugar or maltodextrin in it. However, when we look at a competitor’s electrolyte powder that also claims it doesn’t have sugar or maltodextrin, it turns blue when iodine is added.**

Maltodextrin behaves like sugar, spiking insulin, but can be classified on a label as a carb and not a sugar. On the glycemic index, table sugar is at 65, and glucose is at 100—maltodextrin is between 105 and 185.

Maltodextrin is the most common starch added to supplements and other products. If there is less than one gram of maltodextrin in a product per serving size, the company doesn’t even have to state it. Maltodextrin can also be found in flavorings, energy gels, sports powders, and even baby formulas. It’s important to be aware that some so-called keto-friendly products can also contain maltodextrin.

## What Are The Most Effective Treatments To Reduce An Enlarged Prostate  6Dbeee

# What are the most effective treatments to reduce an enlarged prostate naturally?

**Symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia:**

• Frequent urination (especially at night)

• A weak stream

• Dribbling after urination

• A sensation that you can’t fully empty your bladder

Excess estrogen increases the size of the prostate. Estrogen also increases prolactin, which can increase the size of the prostate. Estrogen is a byproduct of testosterone in both females and males. To convert testosterone to estrogen, you need an enzyme called aromatase. The testicles and fat cells make aromatase.

Phytoestrogens can mimic estrogen, but not very much. To shrink the prostate naturally, we want to inhibit aromatase to decrease estrogen production.

**Top things that increase aromatase:**

• Age

• Body fat

• Insulin

• High-carb diets

• Alcohol

• Whole grains

• Hormone replacement therapy

• Birth control pills

**Things that decrease aromatase:**

• Cruciferous vegetables

• White button mushrooms (sautéed)

• Flaxseed

• Green tea

• Citrus peel

In addition to losing weight with Healthy Keto®, reducing insulin, and consuming cruciferous vegetables, you can try a fantastic natural remedy for an enlarged prostate that involves citrus peel.

**The best natural remedy to support prostate health:**

Add a whole lemon and a glass of water to a blender, and blend it for about 30 seconds.

Then, blend again with about five to ten drops of liquid stevia or 1/2 to 1 cup of blueberries. You can have this at any time of day—enjoy!

## What Are The Health Benefits Of Supplementing With Lactobacillus And B A49C03

# What are the health benefits of supplementing with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains?

Many times people will see a doctor because of depression, and the doctor will want to load them up on prescription medications. The problem is that in some situations, the person can never come off of the medication, and the medication can cause serious side-effects.

If you have depression, it may be beneficial to look at your diet and see what could be improved. You may want to consider the heathy keto diet and intermittent fasting. Vitamin D may also be beneficial. Something else that could be very important to do is to fix your gut. There is a huge connection between what’s going on in your large intestine and your overall mood.

It has been found that with major depressive disorder, there are high levels of certain microbes and low levels of other microbes in the gut. These microbes could have a huge influence on your overall mood. There is one microbe in particular that could have many different benefits for someone who is depressed. This microbe is called lactobacillus bifidobacterium.

Lactobacillus bifidobacterium can be found in foods like:

1\. Bulgarian yogurt (high-quality and high-fat yogurt)

2\. Kimchi

3\. Sauerkraut

4\. Cheese

5\. Kefir

6\. Pickles

This microbe could be beneficial because it helps make certain neurotransmitters like GABA and serotonin. Microbes like this one also make vitamins, including B1 and other B vitamins. If you can’t consume these foods on a regular basis, you could try taking a probiotic with lactobacillus in it.

## What Are The Potential Health Benefits Of Incorporating Lupin Flour In 2360E4

# What are the potential health benefits of incorporating lupin flour into the diet?

Lupin flour comes from the lupin bean, which is a legume similar to a peanut. It’s non-GMO, and it has a neutral taste. It also has a great texture that’s very similar to other flours. It has been consumed in certain parts of the world for a very long time, and it’s loaded with antioxidants. Lupin flour is even very low on the glycemic index.

It should be noted that lupin flour does have some lectins and phytic acid, which some people are sensitive to. But most people shouldn’t have a problem with it.

**Benefits**

- High in fiber

- High in protein

- Doesn’t have starch

- Could be used in making a keto-friendly pasta, bread and cookies

- Rich in nutrients:

    - vitamin B1

    - magnesium

    - phosphorus

    - iron

## What Are The Therapeutic Benefits Of Inositol In The Management Of Pol C29Db8

# What are the therapeutic benefits of inositol in the management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)?

PCOS occurs when the androgen male sex hormones are too high in a women’s body. Symptoms include growing facial hair, developing belly fat, and hair loss on your head. You might get a deeper voice.

High levels of androgen are caused by high levels of insulin. So of course you want to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to lower your insulin levels. But there’s a little more to it.

There’s a vitamin called inositol that’s part of the vitamin B family. Interestingly, if you suck on it, it tastes sweet. Inositol is involved in sugar metabolism. Inositol is actually nine different vitamin B compounds, Two of the nine versions are called MYO and D-chiro. I and others believe that in women with PCOS, the MYO doesn’t convert to the d-chiro. So on top of the high levels of insulin and androgens, this contributes to the problem.

When you give women with PCOS a 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, their symptoms improve, as does their fertility, weight loss, acne, and the quality of their eggs. Find an inositol supplement that has this 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, to further enhance the benefits of keto and intermittent fasting. Inositol alone won’t completely help. You’ve got to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to get your insulin levels low enough to stop driving up your androgen levels.

## How Can I Address Body Odor While On Keto

# How can I address body odor while on Keto?

There are a few things that could cause an odor in your urine or breath, like:

- Liver damage

- Infection

- Dehydration

- Asparagus

- Too much protein

As you transition to keto and intermittent fasting your ketones are going to go up. There
are three types of ketones, but the one that creates the most detectable odor on breath and in urine is acetone. If your urine is darker, cloudy, and has a strong odor chances are it’s going to be acetone (not the nail polish remover; that is different). Your sweat and breath can also have a strong odor as a result.

Your body actually makes acetone as a natural consequence of consuming more fat and less carbohydrate. It is a normal thing and not a concern at all.

To get rid of the odor, increase chlorophyll in your diet. It is a deodorizer that comes from leafy greens. Increase your fluids, and not just by drinking water, but using electrolytes with your water to become more hydrated.

Lastly, as long as you are consistent with your diet, the odor will go away as your body gets adapted to ketosis.

We also recommend trying Dr. Berg's Electrolytes Powder drink. This drink is a perfect keto-friendly beverage! Here is the link: [https://shop.drberg.com/electrolyte-powder-raspberry-lemon-100-servings](https://shop.drberg.com/electrolyte-powder-raspberry-lemon-100-servings)

## I Experience Headaches On Keto. What Do I Do

# I experience headaches on keto. What do I do?

This is usually a problem with low blood sugar. Your brain has not fully adapted to ketosis quite yet. Add one more meal for a while until your body adapts more efficiently and can go longer without the drop in blood sugars. We also recommend taking Dr. Berg's course on How to Burn Fat & Get into Healthy Ketosis WITHOUT Any Side Effects!

## What Can I Do To Address Sleep Problems While Following A Ketogenic Diet

# What can I do to address sleep problems while following a ketogenic diet?

If you aren’t following Healthy Keto®, you may be lacking sleep-promoting nutrients like B vitamins, magnesium, calcium, and potassium. This deficiency can occur during the transition phase as your body adapts to burning fat for energy—a process that initially leads to increased alertness since fat provides more than double the energy storage potential compared to carbohydrates. As a result, you might feel more awake, while carbohydrates can cause fatigue, often making you feel sleepy after consumption.

To improve your sleep and expedite the transition to ketosis, consider increasing your intake of minerals, particularly potassium, as well as B vitamins, and incorporating more daily exercise to utilize excess energy. Other factors that may contribute to sleeplessness on a ketogenic diet include excessive coffee consumption, not practicing intermittent fasting, low calcium levels, bloating from kale, or waking up due to fluctuations in blood sugar levels. Addressing these issues can help enhance your overall sleep quality while adapting to the ketogenic lifestyle.

## What Can Help Battle Fluid Retention On Keto Diet Or Any Diet

# What can help battle fluid retention on Keto diet or any diet?

Let's discuss water retention and weight gain in the context of the ketogenic diet.

Water retention, characterized by an excessive buildup of fluid in the circulatory system, can be influenced by various factors in the ketogenic diet. It's important to note that the weight gain observed is typically related to water rather than actual fat.

Let's discuss water retention and weight gain in the context of the ketogenic diet. Water retention, characterized by an excessive buildup of fluid in the circulatory system, can be influenced by various factors in the ketogenic diet. It's important to note that the weight gain observed is typically related to water rather than actual fat. Causes of Water Retention:

1\. Low Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): A deficiency in Vitamin B1 can lead to fluid retention and ankle edema. Adding nutritional yeast to your diet can help address this deficiency.

2\. Low Potassium: Inadequate vegetable consumption can result in low potassium levels. However, if you're still experiencing fluid retention despite consuming many vegetables, it could be due to an inability to digest excessive fiber. Leafy greens are an excellent source of potassium.

3\. Fiber: Both soluble and insoluble fiber can contribute to fluid retention. Fiber demands fluid to bulk up and facilitate the passage of stool through the digestive system.

4\. High Salt Intake: Excessive salt consumption can contribute to water retention.

5\. High Carbohydrate Intake: Consuming too many carbs is associated with fluid retention because carbohydrates have the ability to retain fluid.

It's crucial to understand that on the ketogenic diet, any observed weight gain is predominantly water weight, not fat. Adjusting your diet to address specific nutrient deficiencies and moderating fiber intake can help manage water retention and promote a healthier balance.

## How To Get Rid Of Sebaceous Filaments

# How to get rid of sebaceous filaments?

Many people mistake sebaceous filaments for blackheads and try to remove them by using tweezers or other methods. However, this can damage the skin. The presence of sebaceous filaments and blackheads is often linked to the overproduction of sebum. This production is regulated by a hormone called androgens, which can increase during puberty, pregnancy, or other hormonal imbalances. So, how do we address the root cause of sebaceous filaments? One way is to regulate and balance our androgen levels through dietary changes. Consuming foods high in vitamin A, D, and omega-3 fatty acids while reducing the intake of seed oils found in processed foods can help decrease sebum production. Another way to reduce and balance androgen levels is through intermittent fasting and the keto diet, which helps lower insulin levels. High levels of insulin can also contribute to the overproduction of sebum. Additionally, zinc deficiency has been linked to raised sebum production. Consuming zinc-rich foods such as shellfish and red meat can help address this deficiency. Managing stress levels is also essential, as chronic stress can deplete our zinc levels.

## How Beneficial Is Resveratrol

# How beneficial is resveratrol??

People who think they have a slow metabolism actually have an efficient metabolism. This means their body requires less fuel. To lose stubborn fat, you must get your body to waste more fuel. The mitochondria are the body's “energy factories,” turning food into stored energy, known as ATP. Uncoupling occurs when the mitochondria make less ATP and more heat.

Resveratrol is a natural mitochondrial uncoupler. It’s found in grapes, cranberries, blueberries, dark chocolate, pistachios, and Japanese knotweed. Resveratrol is also made into a powder supplement. One tablespoon per day can help reduce belly fat by encouraging mitochondrial uncoupling.

Ketones can cause mitochondrial uncoupling and improve the function of the mitochondria. Cold therapy, exercise, fasting, green tea, saunas, and jacuzzis also cause mitochondrial uncoupling.

## Nutrient Optimization During Fasting

# Nutrient Optimization During Fasting

While intermittent fasting can be a powerful tool for improving health, ensuring you're still meeting your body's nutritional needs during your eating windows is crucial.

Keeping an eye on consuming adequate amounts of some often-overlooked heroes – namely magnesium, potassium, and B vitamins– is crucial for staying healthy; they’re fundamental for ensuring everything inside us operates correctly.

Fasting may make your body more prone to nutrient deficiencies, particularly if you don't consume a proper diet during your eating windows.

Consider incorporating nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens, nuts, and seeds into your meals to help prevent deficiencies and support overall health.

Additionally, some people may benefit from supplementing with specific nutrients during their fasting journey.

For example, taking a high-quality magnesium supplement before bed can help support restful sleep and reduce muscle cramps, while consuming citrate-rich foods like lemon juice can help counter keto flu symptoms by promoting hydration and electrolyte balance.

## What Steps Should I Take If Ive Plateaued On A Ketogenic Diet And Inte 362Bd8

# What steps should I take if I've plateaued on a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting?

The primary objective is to manage insulin levels effectively while promoting a healthy metabolic state. To achieve this, consider the following strategies:

1. **Avoid Snacking**: Eliminate snacks throughout the day to maintain stable insulin levels.

2. **Adopt a Two-Meal Structure**: Limit your meals to twice a day, ensuring they are sufficiently high in healthy fats. This will help sustain satiety between meals and support metabolic function.

Implementing these changes may help you overcome the plateau and enhance your overall progress on a ketogenic diet combined with intermittent fasting.

## Im Addicted To Sugar But I Feel Great When Im On Keto. I Want To Lose  Af525E

# I'm addicted to sugar but I feel great when I'm on Keto. I want to lose weight - any word of advice?

Now we have to pretend that sugar is scarce. And so you have to do all sorts of things from not buying it, you know, cleaning out your sugar from your house. In fact, I think that would be a really good thing to do.

Go through all your cupboards, your refrigerator and remove all the sugar, get it out because, that late night when you're craving and you're going to your fridge and you're debating whether you're going to drive to the store or not, but you got to drive. So that will discourage you.

But the other thing too, is that once you get off sugar, okay, it might take a week or two, but then you're going to adapt to fat burning and your cravings will go away unless you eat them again.

And the other thing too is just the attitude of being in charge of your body. Because your body will give you all sorts of crazy messages like I want that donut over there.

## What Are Seven Effective Strategies To Significantly Boost Your Energy Levels

# What are seven effective strategies to significantly boost your energy levels?

**Beyond the Caffeine Buzz: Understanding Real Energy**

You're right! Coffee doesn't actually give you energy, it just masks tiredness for a while. And that sugar rush? It leads to an energy crash later. So, what can you do to boost your energy naturally and avoid that slump?

**7 Natural Energy Boosters**

1. **Mighty Magnesium:** This mineral is crucial for making ATP, the energy your body runs on. Think leafy greens, nuts, avocado, and fish for magnesium-rich fuel.

2. **Charge Up Your Cells:** Your cells have a "sodium-potassium pump" that generates power for your muscles and nerves. Make sure you get enough of these electrolytes through food or a supplement.

3. **Mighty Mitochondria:** These are your cells' powerhouses! Exercise, fasting, a splash of cold water, and colorful polyphenol-rich foods (think berries and dark chocolate) can all help you build more mitochondria for extra energy.

4. **Ketone Power:** A keto diet can switch your fuel source to ketones, which burn cleaner and more efficiently than glucose.

5. **Carnitine Kick:** This compound shuttles fat to your mitochondria for fuel. It helps you work out longer and recover faster. Red meat is a great source of carnitine.

6. **Apple Cider Vinegar Advantage:** Your mitochondria can use this tangy tonic as an extra energy source. A tablespoon in water daily might do the trick.

7. **B Vitamin Boost:** B vitamins support your mitochondria, helping them turn food into energy. Nutritional yeast is a tasty source of these power-packed vitamins.

## Can You Have Sheep Milk Cheese On Keto

# Can you have sheep milk cheese on keto?

Yes, the good bacteria that turn sheep milk into sheep milk cheese consume the lactose in the milk. Lactose is milk sugar, so when it’s removed from fermented milk products like sheep milk cheese, the carbohydrate content is drastically reduced.

## Are Brown Rice Cakes Keto

# Are brown rice cakes keto?

No, brown rice cakes aren’t keto-friendly, either. 

While brown rice offers some nutritional advantages over white rice - such as more dietary fiber - these benefits are minimal. Brown rice-based products still contain considerable amounts of carbs that can interfere with fat-burning and push you out of ketosis.

Additionally, brown rice-derived snacks like crackers or chips often include other ingredients such as sugars, flour, or syrups, increasing their net carb content.

Rice cake net carbs:

- White rice cakes: 7g per piece

- Brown rice cakes: 6g per piece

- Caramel rice cake: 11g per piece

Rice cakes aren't a good option for individuals on a keto diet due to their considerable carb content and the adverse effect on glucose levels.

Instead, exploring [keto-friendly snack alternatives](https://www.drberg.com/blog/keto-snacks-guide) that align with your dietary goals is best.

## Nutrition Strategies For Optimal Muscle Gain

# Nutrition Strategies for Optimal Muscle Gain

Macronutrient Balance: Achieving muscle growth requires a careful balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Aim for approximately 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight to support muscle repair and growth. Include healthy fats—like those from avocados, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish—targeting around 0.5 grams per pound of body weight for hormone production and overall health.

Keto, Fasting, and Exercise: Combining ketogenic principles and intermittent fasting with strategic exercise routines enhances muscle development. Brined chicken thighs are a valuable addition, offering lean protein that supports muscle growth and aligns with both keto and fasting protocols.

## Transforming Your Burger Experience On Keto

# Transforming Your Burger Experience on Keto

## **Transforming Your Burger Experience on Keto**

Bibb butter head lettuce isn't just a salad ingredient anymore. Now, this verdant option provides an excellent and crunchy substitute for the usual bread slices surrounding your burger.

Its sturdy leaves can hold up to even the juiciest of burgers, ensuring you get that satisfying crunch with every bite.

But it's not all about texture; choosing lettuce over bread slashes carbs and adds [nutrients like vitamin A](https://www.drberg.com/blog/why-is-vitamin-a-named-retinol) and potassium to your meal. Switching to lettuce isn't just a minor change; it infuses your keto journey with nutritional perks and a burst of taste.

### **Portobello Mushroom Caps**

If you're craving something more substantial than lettuce, roasted portobello mushroom tops are here to save the day. These savory caps provide a meaty base that complements any burger patty perfectly.

The best part? They soak up flavors like nobody’s business—think garlic, herbs, or marinades—that elevate your burger from good to gourmet in minutes.

Moreover, they're scant in [carbohydrates](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-carb-more-deadly-than-sugar-surprising) yet abundant in fiber and protein, offering a dual advantage for those vigilant about their nutritional intake.

### **Napa Cabbage for an Asian Twist**

Napa Chinese cabbage brings something entirely different to the table—an Asian twist with its unique peppery taste and crunchy texture. Just imagine wrapping a spicy pork or beef patty in these crispy leaves.

This choice is exceptionally splendid if you aim to diversify your [keto diet](https://www.drberg.com/blog/when-to-change-your-keto-diet) while keeping carbs at bay. Napa cabbage also boasts impressive amounts of folate and vitamins K and C.

## How To Smoothly Transition To Fasting

# How to smoothly transition to fasting?

Transitioning to intermittent fasting can present challenges, but proper preparation can help ease the process and optimize results.

**Managing Transitional Symptoms**

Common symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, nausea, or dizziness, often referred to as "keto flu," may occur as your body shifts from glucose to ketones for energy. Staying hydrated, getting sufficient sleep, and paying attention to your body's signals are essential for managing these symptoms. If needed, shorten your fasting window or break your fast early to aid adaptation.

**Nutrient Optimization**

Ensuring adequate nutrient intake during eating windows is crucial for overall health. Focus on consuming magnesium, potassium, and B vitamins to support bodily functions. Incorporate nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and whole grains to prevent deficiencies. Consider supplements such as magnesium before bed for restful sleep and citrate-rich foods like lemon juice to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance.

## How Can I Do A Vegetarian Version Of The Keto Diet

# How can I do a vegetarian version of the keto diet?

A vegetarian keto diet is achievable with careful planning. Key nutrients like zinc, vitamin A (retinol), B12, and DHA are challenging but can be sourced from specific foods:

1\. **Zinc and Vitamin A**: Focus on beta-carotene-rich vegetables, though retinol may require supplementation.

2\. **B12**: Consider fortified foods or supplements.

3\. **DHA and Omega-3**: Obtain from algae or spirulina.

For protein, combine sources like:

\- Spirulina

\- Nuts (e.g., walnuts)

\- Sprouted legumes

\- Organic tofu or tempeh

Keep net carbs under 50 grams per day by avoiding grains and focusing on low-carb vegetables and protein sources. With careful planning, a vegetarian keto diet can be both nutritious and effective.

## If I Dont Consume Glucose I Hit A Wall When Running. What Can I Do

# If I don’t consume glucose, I hit a wall when running. What can I do?

I think you just need to kind of study some of the long distance runners that have got into a really good keto adaptation to the point where or fat adaptation, where they can just oxidize fat like way better than anyone else. And because what's happening, you're running up against the loss of glycogen. And now, where's the fuel? Your body just hasn't really been able to tap into the fat because you're not fully converted over yet and that takes some time. That's what I would shoot for as a long term goal.

A couple other things I would recommend. I would maybe as a transition, you do not the glucose but maybe you do some fruit. Try that for a while. Then push that to the side. And then maybe you do maybe a starch.

So it's kind of a stair-step approach because when you do this straight those packs are just pure dextrose synthetic from corn syrup. They're just going to deplete a lot of B vitamins, B1, and that's going to affect your performance as well as deplete other things too. So you're taking this refined sugar. I think they even use maltodextrin. It's just so refined and it's going to be burned as fuel but it's going to come with a package because in order to burn that fuel, you need a lot of other nutrients. So at the very, very minimum, you should be taking B vitamins, electrolytes, not too many but just enough to compensate for that refined sugar that's going to deplete.

## Can I Have Mexican Food On A Keto Diet

# Can I have Mexican food on a Keto diet?

Yes, you can enjoy Mexican food on a keto diet by making a few adjustments. Focus on high-quality ingredients and avoid corn, corn tortillas, and wheat products. Instead, opt for dishes featuring guacamole, almond tortillas, and low-carb sauces.

Avoid rice and beans, and you'll still have plenty of flavorful options. For keto-friendly Mexican recipes, you can visit my YouTube channel, which offers a variety of delicious and compliant dishes. It's crucial to know what's on the "okay" list and what to avoid to maintain your keto lifestyle.

## What Are The Important Factors In Building Muscle Mass Beyond Protein

# What are the important factors in building muscle mass beyond protein?

We often think that increasing protein helps build muscle because muscle is made of protein. But this doesn’t always work. Some people that eat more protein may even suffer from amino acid deficiency. You need sufficient amounts of protein to build muscle, but, more importantly, you need sufficient amino acids.

The general thought is that you need .8 grams of protein per kilogram of lean body mass—not overall weight. This might look like around 50 grams of protein per day. A moderate amount of protein would be between 1.2 and 1.7 grams per kilogram of lean body mass. High protein would be about 2 grams per kilogram of lean body mass.

**It’s essential to focus on consuming quality protein from eggs, meat, fish, and dairy. It’s not ideal to rely on getting your protein from plant sources or protein powder to build healthy muscles.**

**Factors that influence the production of muscle protein:**

**1\. Insulin resistance**

What to do:

• Get on a low-carb diet (Healthy Keto®)

• Do intermittent fasting

**2\. Growth hormone**

What to do:

• Intense exercise

• Get plenty of sleep

• Do intermittent fasting

**3\. Testosterone**

What to do:

• Consume zinc (red meat, shellfish, seafood)

• Avoid refined carbs and sugar

• Lower your stress

• Avoid soy protein isolates, soy milk, beer, and alcohol

**4\. Stress**

What to do:

• Take a look at my other videos on how to lower stress

**5\. The microbiome**

What to do:

• Consume probiotic foods

**6\. Low stomach acid**

What to do:

• Take betaine hydrochloride

**7\. Low enzymes in the pancreas or small intestine**

What to do:

• Consume enzyme-rich foods

• Take an amino acid supplement

**8\. Lean protein**

What to do:

• Consume fattier protein sources

## What Are Effective Methods For Eliminating Blackheads And Sebaceous Filaments

# What are effective methods for eliminating blackheads and sebaceous filaments?

We will also explore the root causes and how to address these issues to achieve long-term results.

**Many people mistake sebaceous filaments for blackheads and try to remove them by using tweezers or other methods. However, this can damage the skin.**

**The presence of sebaceous filaments and blackheads is often linked to the overproduction of sebum. This production is regulated by a hormone called androgens, which can increase during puberty, pregnancy, or other hormonal imbalances.**

So, how do we address the root cause of sebaceous filaments? **One way is to regulate and balance our androgen levels through dietary changes. Consuming foods high in vitamin A, D, and omega-3 fatty acids while reducing the intake of seed oils found in processed foods can help decrease sebum production.**

**Another way to reduce and balance androgen levels is through intermittent fasting and the keto diet, which helps lower insulin levels. High levels of insulin can also contribute to the overproduction of sebum.**

Additionally, zinc deficiency has been linked to raised sebum production. Consuming zinc-rich foods such as shellfish and red meat can help address this deficiency. Managing stress levels is also essential, as chronic stress can deplete our zinc levels.

## Do I Have To Eat More If Im Not Losing Weight

# Do I have to eat more if I'm not losing weight?

The reason that you're not losing weight is that you're not eating enough. So the solution is to just eat more food, right?

This just doesn't make any sense. How could adding more food cause you to lose calories?

**What you do want to do to support healthy weight loss is to increase your nutrients. Vitamins, minerals, and other vital nutrients can help support a healthy body and promote weight loss.**

**The best way to lose weight is to cut out your carbohydrates and eat less frequently.** This doesn't mean you need to lower your calories—just avoid any calories from carbohydrates and eat less often. What this does is decreases insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the cause of a slow metabolism.

**If you can't seem to lose weight, this is a sign of insulin resistance.** Chances are, you are eating way too many carbohydrates. Keep in mind that lowering your calories is not a good idea either. Lowering your calories can deplete the body of nutrients and low down your metabolism further. Avoid low-calorie diets! In summary, Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting are the best ways to lose weight and support a healthy body.

## Can I Consume Cheese Every Day

# Can I consume cheese every day?

**Cheese is a great protein source, has probiotic properties, and is low in lactose.**

**The best cheeses are goat cheese and sheep cheese. These cheeses contain A2 casein, which is easier on your digestive system than lactose. Surprisingly, the oldest people in the world consume sheep cheese and goat cheese!**

Cow's milk is around 4% lactose, while cottage cheese and mozzarella cheese vary from 1% to 4% lactose. Goat cheese and sheep cheese are only about .5% lactose. Goat and sheep cheese are higher in protein, vitamin A, vitamin E, folic acid, B vitamins, calcium, and CLA than cow's milk cheese. CLA helps with exercise performance and weight loss.

Around 20% to 30% of the fat in sheep and goat cheese is MCT fat, which is converted directly into ketones. Sheep cheese and goat cheese generate quick energy with little stress on your digestion.

**Cheese from animals who graze at higher altitudes is higher in polyphenols. When you introduce these polyphenols to your mitochondria, it triggers an uncoupling effect. This means it generates extra energy, which is effective if you’re trying to lose weight. Polyphenols also stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis.**

**Research has shown that people who live longest have more mitochondria uncoupling. Other ways to stimulate mitochondrial uncoupling include exercise, cold therapy, fasting, and consuming other polyphenols like sulforaphane, turmeric, and green tea.**

## Keto Friendly Foods That Will Not Break Your Fast

# Keto Friendly Foods that Will Not Break Your Fast

The ideal fasting process is by only consuming water but the important part is keeping the insulin levels low so if you consume something that would keep the insulin low, it is not going to interfere with the benefits of fasting.

**Things that will NOT affect insulin:**

1\. Fiber (green salad)

2\. Fat (MCT Oil, Butter, Coconut Oil, Whole Cream)

3\. Tea / Coffee

4\. Supplements

5\. Green Powder

## What If I Dont Consume Dairy On Keto   Do You Have Any Tips

# What If I don't consume dairy on Keto - do you have any tips?

I’m going to tell you how to do the keto diet while remaining dairy-free, for those of you who are lactose intolerant or have an allergy to the proteins in dairy. You may also be sensitive to the quality of the dairy since dairy products can contain hormones or come from animals fed with genetically-modified grains.

I personally do well with raw-milk cheese that’s grass-fed and organic. You may want to try dairy products that are grass-fed and organic to see if you tolerate them. Be sure to avoid processed cheese like Velveeta, which is filled with unhealthy ingredients.

If you truly need to adhere to dairy-free eating, there are several healthy alternatives that are totally acceptable on keto. They are coconut products, nuts, and nut butter, olive products and avocados, animal fat, and ghee.

I included ghee, also called clarified butter, even though strictly speaking it’s dairy. But ghee has the milk solids removed, leaving only the fat, which you may be able to eat. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. As you see, there are numerous alternatives.

If you’re sensitive to nuts in addition to adhering to dairy-free eating, that complicates things. You have to remove nuts and nut butter as healthy fats. And if you’re not eating dairy, can’t eat nuts, and are vegan, that really limits your options for healthy fat. However, there are always substitutes. You just have to get creative to be sure you get the correct amount of healthy fat when you’re on keto.

Don’t worry if you avoid dairy. You can be successful on the keto diet by using viable substitutes.

## Easy Keto Candied Pecans Recipe

# Easy Keto Candied Pecans Recipe

My favorite nut is the pecan, and these sugar-free candied pecans are just amazing. If you’re looking for healthy snacks, you can add this to the list. I would put these on a salad or even keto-friendly ice cream. These are incredible. They are really sweet but yet they are low-carb, and there is no sugar in them. Pecans are also loaded with vitamin B6. 

**Keto Candied Pecans Recipe:**

**Ingredients**

• 1 egg white 

• 1 pound pecan halves

• ½ cup sugar substitute (we use Just Like Sugar)

• 3 tsp ground cinnamon

• ½ tsp sea salt

**Directions**

1\. In a large bowl, beat the egg white until frothy but not stiff. Add the pecans into the bowl and mix well so all the nuts are covered with egg whites. 

2\. In a small bowl, combine the cinnamon, salt, and sugar. Sprinkle the sugar mixture onto the nuts and mix bit by bit until all the mixture has been added. Mix well to coat thoroughly. 

3\. Pour candied nuts onto a parchment or silicone mat-lined baking pan and spread them out as evenly as you can. 

4\. Bake at 325°F for 20 minutes, stirring about halfway through. It is vital not to overcook. Let it cool. Break nuts apart a bit with hands. Store in a ziplock bag or airtight container.

## Is Cassava Safe To Consume On Keto

# Is cassava safe to consume on Keto?

Can you have cassava chips on keto? Cassava is very high in carbohydrates. It’s also very high on the glycemic index. Cassava is a starch—it’s a root vegetable. Cassava is also used to make tapioca. Tapioca is not keto-friendly. Another name for cassava is yuca. Cassava or yuca is not keto-friendly.

Cassava also contains very small amounts of vitamin B1 (thiamine). This is a problem because anytime you have something with a lot of carbs and low vitamin B1, you can create a vitamin B1 deficiency. This happens because it takes vitamin B1 to metabolize carbs.

## What Are Some Keto Friendly Foods

# What are some Keto-friendly foods?

Dr. Berg talks about Acceptable Pleasure Foods on the ketogenic diet. These foods are not meant to be consumed as a snack but after the meal as a dessert. These recipes are low carb, however, the bread recipe contains a bit more carb due to a tiny bit of molasses and arrowroot flour, however, it's still a lot smaller than typical bread due to no wheat flour. Also, test the waters with these recipes because some people are sensitive to sugar alcohol and can experience some bloating. Then some people consume excess amounts of these treats and because of the delicious recipes, they eat WAY TOO MUCH- so be careful.

## Keto Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe

# Keto Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe

It’s hard to make chocolate chip cookies that taste good and are still keto-friendly and low carb. Getting the consistency right can be tricky. But, we’ve done it. 

This is a really easy recipe that we actually got off of the almond flour bag we bought, and Karen Berg just changed it a tiny bit. Almond flour is so easy to get, and it’s an excellent flour alternative. Instead of using brown sugar, Karen uses white powder sweetener with a tiny touch of molasses. 

Enjoy these cookies with a meal.  

**How to make Dr. Berg-approved Chocolate Chip Cookies**

**Ingredients:**

½ cup butter, stored under room temperature

¼ cup sugar substitute (I use Just Like Sugar.)

¼ cup brown sugar (as a sugar-free substitute.

I use ¼ cup of Just Like Sugar PLUS 1 tsp of Black Strap Molasses.)

1 tsp vanilla

1 egg, plus

1 egg white

2 ½ cups almond flour

1 ¼ cup sugar-free chocolate chips (I use King Arthur’s brand.)

½ tsp baking soda

¼ tsp salt

**Directions:**

In a medium bowl, mix all wet ingredients and beat until creamy.

In a larger bowl, mix all dry ingredients.

Add water to dry and mix well, into a dough. Make into balls (Choose the size!). Press slightly using your palm, as these do not spread as they bake. But don’t make them too thin, as they have a GREAT consistency when they are about ½ inch thick.

Bake at 350 for about 13-15 minutes, and get slightly brown on top. Do not overbake. 

If necessary, take out one early and let it cool to check consistency. You can always put the cookies back in for a minute to firm them up. Ovens cook differently, so I go for a shorter time and test, and pop back in the oven if I need to.

Enjoy!

## Keto Chocolate Seed Treat

# Keto Chocolate Seed Treat

Nuts are heavy on the gallbladder. So, I wanted to make a healthy treat that had a low amount of chocolate, and I didn’t want to use nuts. So, I used seeds instead. I used sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds.  Both sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds are packed with protein, fiber, healthy fats, and vitamins.

**Only eat these with a meal, NOT between meals.**  

**RECIPE:**

5 cups of seeds.

Use 2 1/2 cups of roasted salted sunflower seeds and 2 1/2 cups of roasted salted pumpkin seeds.

9 ounces of Lily's chocolate chips. You could use Simply Lite Chocolate (3 bars) with maltitol but it can create more digestive gas for some people.

1-3 tbs of coconut oil.

1 tsp of vanilla extract.

Sea salt (pinch) if your seeds are not salted

**Directions:**

Melt chocolate and coconut oil

Mix in chocolate and oil to seed mix 

Add vanilla extract and salt if needed

Spread over a tray with parchment paper

Put in freezer for 15 minutes to 1 hour

**Enjoy!**

## Can I Use Inositol For Pcos

# Can I use inositol for PCOS?

PCOS occurs when the androgen male sex hormones are too high in a women’s body. Symptoms include growing facial hair, developing belly fat, and hair loss on your head. You might get a deeper voice.

High levels of androgen are caused by high levels of insulin. So of course you want to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to lower your insulin levels. But there’s a little more to it.

There’s a vitamin called inositol that’s part of the vitamin B family. Interestingly, if you suck on it, it tastes sweet. Inositol is involved in sugar metabolism. Inositol is actually nine different vitamin B compounds, Two of the nine versions are called MYO and D-chiro. I and others believe that in women with PCOS, the MYO doesn’t convert to the d-chiro. So on top of the high levels of insulin and androgens, this contributes to the problem.

When you give women with PCOS a 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, their symptoms improve, as does their fertility, weight loss, acne, and the quality of their eggs. Find an inositol supplement that has this 40:1 ratio of MYO to D-chiro, to further enhance the benefits of keto and intermittent fasting. Inositol alone won’t completely help. You’ve got to do healthy keto and intermittent fasting to get your insulin levels low enough to stop driving up your androgen levels.

## Does Intermittent Fasting Increase Gallbladder Sludge

# Does intermittent fasting increase gallbladder sludge?

Intermittent fasting can lead to gallbladder sludge due to concentrated bile during periods of fasting, typically peaking around 10 to 15 hours after the last meal. Symptoms include right shoulder and abdominal pain, bloating, burping, and nausea. To mitigate these issues:

1\. Add lemon or apple cider vinegar to water during fasting to help thin bile.

2\. Gradually introduce fats in a ketogenic diet to avoid overwhelming the gallbladder.

3\. Keto and intermittent fasting can lower insulin levels, reducing the risk of gallstone formation typically associated with high insulin.

## What Are The Most Effective Methods For Diminishing Acne Scars

# What are the most effective methods for diminishing acne scars?

If you have scarring from acne, one of the best things you can do is to use vitamin E oil.

When using vitamin E oil for acne scars on your face, you may want to use an organic, hexane-free version of vitamin E oil. Vitamin E can have a significant effect on fibrosis. It may actually help break down scar tissue.

Benefits of vitamin E for the skin:

- It’s a powerful antioxidant

- It’s fat-soluble (it goes into the skin)

- It’s an anti-inflammatory

- It can help break down scar tissue

- It can help with certain wrinkles

To use vitamin E oil for your skin, rub it into the skin for about one or two minutes right before you go to bed every night. Do it for about two or three weeks.

To kick things up a notch, you may want to combine the use of vitamin E oil with the Healthy Keto® diet, intermittent fasting, and periodic prolonged fasting. This combination might give you even better results because consuming a lot of carbs and frequent eating can block the effect of vitamin E and can make the skin age faster.

When you do fasting, especially prolonged fasting, your body goes through autophagy, which is a fantastic anti-aging action. You may want to do prolonged fasting once every two weeks or once a month for at least 72 hours.

## What Should I Do If I Cant Make My Kids Eat Healthy Foods

# What should I do if I can’t make my kids eat healthy foods?

If your child only eats junk food, here’s what you need to know:

1\. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Picky eating often results from deficiencies in nutrients like zinc, DHA, and vitamin B1. These can affect taste, mood, and behavior.

2\. **Common Culprits**: Foods like sugary cereals, french fries, and packaged snacks often contain MSG and refined carbs, which can worsen these deficiencies and increase appetite.

3\. **Healthy Alternatives**: Switch to Healthy Keto® foods. Instead of banning junk food, find healthy substitutes and involve your child in cooking.

4\. **Supplements**: Consider supplements to address nutrient deficiencies and make the transition to healthy eating easier.

## Why Is Dietary Fat Important

# Why is dietary fat important?

There are several reasons why you need dietary fat for a keto diet.

- Fat helps you fast longer (lowers hunger and cravings)

- Fat supplies you with nutrients (essential fats and fat-soluble vitamins)

- Fat stimulates bile

- Fat triggers healthy hormones

- Fat supplies your body with healthy tissue

- Fat slows the absorption of protein

- Fat helps you maintain your weight

The truth is, you don’t necessarily need to consume more fat on keto. Most of all, you need to lower your carbohydrates. Carbs affect insulin, and insulin blocks ketosis. The key is to lower your carbs.

Ketosis is also not a high-protein diet. You want to consume only a moderate amount of protein: 3 to 8 oz is fine. You also don’t want to consume lean protein – low-fat protein can exacerbate insulin spikes. Always consume full-fat foods.

## Can I Consume Salt On Keto

# Can I consume salt on keto?

Yes. Add Himalayan sea salt to your keto regime.

You need around 1 to 2 tsp of salt per day. This depends on your activity level. If you sweat a lot, this can increase your need for sodium. If you’re on keto, you want a bare minimum of 1 tsp of salt a day. This is because, as you lose fat, you also lose water weight and electrolytes. Salt is a vital electrolyte.

Himalayan salt is actually very different from standard sea salt. Here’s why. Although both Himalayan salt and sea salt have trace minerals, generic sea salt also has microplastics. One study found that 90% of sea salt products had small amounts of plastics. However, Himalayan salt has zero microplastics. Why? Himalayan salt is sourced from an ancient sea that existed before humans and pollution.

## Can I Use Cassava Flour On Keto

# Can I use cassava flour on keto?

No. Cassava is very high in carbohydrates. It’s also very high on the glycemic index. Cassava is a starch – a root vegetable. It’s not keto-friendly. Cassava is also used to make tapioca, which is not keto-friendly, either. Another name for cassava is yuca. Cassava or yuca are not keto- friendly.

Cassava also contains very small amounts of vitamin B1 (thiamine). This is a problem because any time you have something with a lot of carbs and low vitamin B1, you can create a vitamin B1 deficiency. This happens because you use up vitamin B1 to metabolize carbs.

# Can I consume butternut squash on keto?

**Yes.**

100 grams of squash is about 3 grams of carbs, 2 grams of sugar, 1 gram of fiber, and 1 grams of protein. It has a low glycemic load which means it has a good amount of fiber to buffer the carbohydrate. Squash is very keto-friendly.

**Nutrients in Squash:**

• Vitamin C

• Vitamin A

• Magnesium

• Manganese

• Potassium

**Types of Keto-Friendly Squash**

• Butternut

• Winter

• Spaghetti

• Acorn

## Why Can Stomach Problems Happen On Keto

# Why can stomach problems happen on keto?

Digestive issues on keto, like bloating and nausea, often stem from sugar alcohols and excessive fiber intake. Erythritol and xylitol can cause diarrhea, while too much fiber from veggies or keto products may overwhelm digestion. Opt for whole foods, avoiding synthetic sugars like dextrose and maltodextrin. Moderating MCT oil intake and gradually introducing new fats can help. Consider purified bile salts and betaine hydrochloride supplements. Apple cider vinegar aids digestion. Intermittent fasting can aid digestion by allowing breaks between meals. Limit nuts, peanut butter, almond flour, and cheese initially.

## What Are Some Examples Of Healthy Keto Meals

# What are some examples of healthy keto meals?

Dr. Eric Berg, the Knowledge DocTM shares with you his own keto eating and intermittent fasting routine. If you’re looking for a sample fasting and keto meal plan, or you’re wondering what to eat on keto, this keto-friendly plan is one that really works for him.

**Intermittent fasting routine:**

- I wake up at 5:00 am, and I go to bed at 10:30 p.m. (with intermittent fasting I need less sleep)

- I try to keep my meals within a 3 to 4 hour window so I have around 20 to 21 hours of fasting

- At 5 a.m. I have a small cup of organic coffee with grass-fed half-and-half or heavy cream and one packet of xylitol

- At 6 a.m. I’ll have around 12 to 16 ounces of water with 1 to 2 ounces of organic lemon juice, and take my vitamins

- I have my first meal between 1 and 3 p.m.

- I have my second meal between 5 and 6 p.m.

**Meal 1 example:**

- 4 pasture-raised organic eggs

- 4 oz of organic bacon

- 3 oz high-quality European organic grass-fed cheese (I like sheep cheese and goat cheese)

- 1⁄4 cup olives

- 1 tomato (in moderate amounts, tomatoes are OK on keto)

**Meal 2 example:**

- A big salad (7 to 10 cups): lettuce, bell pepper, tomato (moderate amounts), cabbage, kale, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, balsamic vinaigrette

- A protein (7 oz): sardines (with bones and skin), shrimp, grass-fed and grass-finished hot dogs, organic grass-fed and grass-finished burger, wild-caught salmon, or steak

- Nuts: pecans or pistachios

## How Can I Fix Water Retention On Keto

# How can I fix water retention on keto?

Possible causes of water retention and their fixes:

- Low in vitamin B1 (thiamine) – vitamin B1 deficiencies will create fluid retention and edema in the ankles. Add nutritional yeast to your diet.

- Low potassium – not consuming enough vegetables can keep potassium low. But if you are consuming a lot of vegetables and still have fluid retention, it’s because you can’t digest all the fiber and that it is too much for the microorganisms that you have. Your potassium source must be from among the leafy greens and it is needed to push out the fluids.

- Fiber – a hidden source of fluid retention. It retains fluid and the body will demand fluid to bulk up the fiber, to make the stool form and go through the system.

- High salt consumption

- High-carb diet – or too many carbs, because carbohydrates retain fluid.

## Why Am I Gaining Weight On Keto

# Why am I gaining weight on keto?

If you're not losing weight on keto, it might be due to frequent eating or hidden sugars, which keep insulin high and store fat. However, if you’re exercising, muscle gain can make you weigh more even as your waist gets slimmer, indicating keto is working.

To optimize keto:

\- Double-check your carb intake

\- Adjust your fasting pattern

\- Reduce vegetable intake if bloating

\- Limit fat to about 75g

\- Exercise regularly

\- Add 30 minutes to 1 hour of sleep

\- Include apple cider vinegar, potassium, vitamin B1, magnesium, and vitamin D

\- Reduce stress

\- Address underlying health issues

## What Cocktails Can I Drink On Keto

# What cocktails can I drink on keto?

Any cocktail, as long as it doesn’t have carbs and alcohol.

Here’s a refreshing keto cocktail that doesn’t have any alcohol or sugar:

This beautiful drink is perfect for a hot summer day. It has muddled blackberries, lime, lime juice, rosemary, ginger, and a splash of Ginger Ale Zevia to give it some bubbles.

Ginger Ale Zevia, is of course, sugar-free. Blackberries are also lowest of all berries on the glycemic index.

Ginger is great for your digestion, and raw lime is packed with vitamin C.
While it’s good to drink plenty of water, it can be nice to switch things up. Give this a try!

## Why Do I Have A Dry Mouth On Keto

# Why do I have a dry mouth on keto?

Adults produce 0.5 to 1.5 liters (2 to 6 cups) of saliva daily. On keto, without starches and sugars, the need for amylase and saliva decreases. Additionally, keto increases the need for electrolytes, especially potassium and magnesium.

Reducing carbs often leads to fewer vegetable intake, causing a mineral deficiency. Consuming 7 to 10 cups of salad daily provides the necessary potassium (4,700 mg). Healthy Keto® emphasizes vegetable intake to maintain electrolyte balance.

To prevent dry mouth on keto, increase vegetable consumption, use a good electrolyte powder, and add Himalayan sea salt for better hydration.

## How Much Protein Is Too Much On A Ketogenic Diet

# How much protein is too much on a ketogenic diet?

To manage insulin, aim for 3-6 oz of protein per meal, adjusting for fitness and metabolism. For regular workouts, up to 8 oz may be okay. For one meal a day, you might need more protein.

Dr. Berg suggests grass-fed beef, pasture-raised chicken (with skin), eggs, and wild-caught salmon. Fattier proteins help lower insulin levels.

Calculate your protein needs: body weight (lbs) x 0.4. Divide by your meals per day (2 or 3).

Example: At 172 lbs, you need 68.8g/day. For 2 meals, that's 34.4g/meal.

Adjust to find your ideal amount.

## Is Tapioca Starch Ok To Consume On Keto

# Is tapioca starch ok to consume on Keto?

No. Tapioca is a starch that comes from the cassava plant. It’s actually quite high in carbohydrates. In fact, the carbohydrate content of cassava flour is 25% more than that of white flour.

If we compare tapioca flour to almond flour, this is what we find:

- 1/4 cup tapioca flour – 27 net carbs

- 1/4 cup almond flour – 3 net carbs

There is an ingredient found in many so-called “keto-friendly” products called soluble tapioca fiber. Soluble tapioca fiber is the same thing as “prebiotic tapioca” and “organic non-GMO tapioca fiber.”

Soluble tapioca fiber is a big source of IMO, which is a common sweetener. Dr. Berg no longer recommends it. Recent studies show that IMO has the same glycemic effect as glucose and dextrose. It’s actually worse to use than sugar. If you want to eat keto-friendly foods and stay in ketosis, you may want to stay away from tapioca flour and tapioca fiber.

## What Foods Should I Eat For Nails And Hair

# What foods should I eat for nails and hair?

If you want really nice healthy hair, healthy skin, and healthy nails, then you would want to consume healthy fats like avocado and eggs with the yolks. Not use them topically.

Avocados are loaded with carotenoids. Carotenoids are a fat-soluble phytonutrient. Because there is a good amount of fats in avocados, you’re going to absorb these phytonutrients much better. If you combine avocado and eggs, you will have even better absorption. Consuming eggs and avocados on the keto diet, while also doing intermittent fasting, can result in really nice hair, nails, and skin. 

**Avocado benefits for hair, skin, and nails:**

• Active vitamin A 

• B5

• B6

• Copper

• Folate

• Vitamin K

• Magnesium 

• Biotin 

• Vitamin E 

• Vitamin C 

• Antioxidant properties 

• Anti-inflammatory properties 

• Monosaturated fats

• Oleic acid — 68%

**Egg benefits for hair, skin, and nails:**

• Highest quality protein 

• All vitamins (except vitamin C)

• Minerals

• Trace minerals 

• Essential fatty acids 

• Phospholipids 

• Vitamins A, D, E

• Carotenoids 

• Omega 3

## Does Intermittent Fasting Kill Candida

# Does intermittent fasting kill candida?

A few symptoms of Candida are achiness of joints, fatigue, itchiness of the body, and digestive issues just to name a few. You want to stay away from sugar, birth control pills can accelerate it as well as stress.

Doing intermittent fasting for at least 18 hours or more will put your body in an autophagy state in which the body would eliminate yeast, mold, fungus, and candida. Adding Thyme oil, grapefruit, and seed extract can help with the healing process.

## Should I Take Bcaas On Intermittent Fasting And Keto While Exercising

# Should I take BCAAs on Intermittent fasting and Keto while exercising?

This will spike insulin, but it's a minor point since the insulin spike is small. The real question is WHY are you taking it in the first place.

If you are taking it for recovery, then realize that those amino acids take several hours before they are turned into protein and you would be much better off taking B-vitamins (nutritional yeast) and minerals (electrolytes), since they are the cofactors or helps in the repair of muscles and the creation (synthesis) of muscle.

If you are taking BCAA to build muscle realize that intermittent fasting, in general, will already give you a protein-sparing effect and this protects you from the loss of protein. Growth hormones are spiked too, which helps with this.

Autophagy also occurs which is the recycling of proteins from the cell, thus reducing the need for taking extra protein.

## What Foods Should I Eat To Make Fasting Easier

# What foods should I eat to make fasting easier?

When you’re fasting, anything you consume other than water will break your fast to some degree. But, some food items you can consume will have a very minor effect on your ability to get back into fasting. The biggest things that will break your fast are refined carbs or sugar.

Making sure you have enough nutrients while fasting is critical, as this will make it easier. Some things you can consume to make fasting easier are MCT oil (can add it to coffee), electrolytes (be sure there are no added sugars), probiotics, B vitamins, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, sea salt, amino acid blends, and kombucha tea.

## Can Sport Drinks Cause Dehydration And Weight Gain

# Can sport drinks cause dehydration and weight gain?

When you think about a sports drink, the first thing that comes to mind is hydration and increased performance. However, the ingredients in most sports drinks could cause the exact opposite. In fact, many studies show that sports drinks do not help your performance at all. 

**Here’s why:**

1\. Sugar dehydrates you because it depletes minerals. Sports drinks are filled with tons of sugar. Some of them have the same amount of sugar as a soda. This can cause even more dehydration. Gatorade contains 36 grams of sugar.

2\. Sports drinks raise your insulin levels, which blocks fat burning and increases fat storage. 

3\. Insulin spikes and sugar crashes can make you tired. In turn, your performance may suffer significantly. 

4\. Sports drinks may lower your potassium, magnesium, and chromium. In summary, sports drinks are not good for hydrating you or losing weight. Instead, go with water or a keto-friendly sports drink with no sugar.

1\. Increase Dietary Fat: Use MCT oil to boost fat intake.

2\. Increase Carbohydrates: Aim for a maximum of 50 grams of carbs per day.

3\. Enhance Exercise: Incorporate regular workouts to prevent muscle loss and allow for recovery.

Make sure to consume plenty of vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, and amino acids to avoid nutrient deficiencies. If weight loss persists, increase your meal frequency from one to two meals a day.

**Avoid:**

\- Most grains and fruits (except raspberries and blackberries).

**Acceptable Carbs:**

\- Carrots.

**Recommendations:**

\- Strength Training: Focus on low-rep, high-weight exercises.

\- Add Healthy Fats: Use MCT oil or butter in meals.

\- Try Teeccino: A naturally decaffeinated herbal coffee.

## Can I Eat Cauliflower On Keto

# Can I eat cauliflower on Keto?

What’s cool about cauliflower is that its low carb, and it tastes like a potato! It seems like a starchy food but without the starch. One cup has 2.6 grams of carbs, but 1.4 grams of fiber makes it a net carb amount of 1.2 grams.

Besides being low carb, cauliflower has a lot of vitamins, especially B vitamins and vitamin C, vitamin E, and vitamin K1. It also has many minerals and trace minerals, especially manganese which is a great antioxidant. But that’s not all. Cauliflower has some serious amounts of phytonutrients (as do all cruciferous vegetables). Phytonutrients act as specialized antioxidants that help with turning certain genes on and off, as well as the maintenance of your DNA.

Keep in mind that the longer you cook cauliflower, the more you destroy its nutrients. 3 minutes of boiling, for example, equals ten minutes of steaming. So steam it for just 5 minutes; but, the way I recommend is to saute it. Ultimately, even if you cook it for a relatively long time, you still get the benefits of cauliflower being a low-carb food along with its fiber. Sometimes when I go to a restaurant I find they have the entire head of cauliflower roasted with cheese on it! And I pretty much eat the whole thing. Cauliflower truly is the ultimate keto food!

## Im Not Hungry On Keto But Still Feeling Weak   Why Is That

# I'm not hungry on keto but still feeling weak - why is that?

One of the best indicators to know if you’re in ketosis is the hunger goes away. But at the same time, you should not have low energy or fatigue on keto. If you’re feeling weak while on keto, it’s likely related to nutrient deficiencies. 

How to fix low energy or feeling weak on the ketogenic diet:

**Muscle weakness** \- Deficiency of vitamin E or sodium

Consume: Seeds, nuts, leafy greens, or a vitamin E complex supplement for a vitamin E deficiency. For low sodium, consume at least 1 tsp. of sea salt per day. 

**Brain Fog** - Insulin resistance 

Consume: MCT oil, and vitamin D

**Fatigue** \- A vitamin B1, vitamin B5, or potassium deficiency 

Consume: Nutritional yeast, potassium, and magnesium (electrolytes, and vegetables).

## Is There An Alternative For Body Mass Index

# Is there an alternative for Body Mass Index?

One of the biggest problems with BMI is that it doesn’t tell you how much fat you have versus muscle. It also can’t give you much of an idea of what's going on with your overall health. Other common measurements:

• BMR (basal metabolic rate): Measures how fast you’re burning calories

• TDEE (total daily energy expenditure): Measures the quantity of energy being burned

• Keto calculator: Measures BMR and TDEE and can tell you how many calories and how many macronutrients you should consume in a day based on your BMR and TDEE

Many times, people look at how much weight they lose per week as a measurement of how healthy their metabolism is. However, this isn’t a good idea. A big principle to consider is: get healthy to lose weight—don’t lose weight to get healthy. In the process of exercising and getting healthy, you’re going to gain muscle. Muscle is heavier than fat. This means that some weeks you may not lose any weight, but your clothes are still going to feel more and more loose. Instead of a BMI test, there are many other helpful tests you can do to help measure your overall health.

One of the best assessments of overall health is the metabolomic test. This test can look at your metabolic pathways in real-time. It can provide great data to help professionals understand what could happen down the road, so you can do something about it now.

## How Many Carbs Are In Alcohol

# How many carbs are in alcohol?

How many carbs are in alcohol depends on the type and whether it’s mixed with other beverages. Beer tends to contain around 15 grams per five-ounce serving, wine typically has between two to four grams per four-ounce serving, and hard liquor mixed with a soft drink can contain as much as 25 grams for an eight-ounce serving. Mixed drinks can contain even more sugar per serving, depending on the ingredients. Because of their high net carbs, alcoholic drinks are not safe on keto diets.

## Are Avocados Safe For Everyone

# Are avocados safe for everyone?

Avocados are generally safe and cause few adverse health effects. Some people appear sensitive to avocados and may experience diarrhea if they consume too many. This is likely caused by the insoluble fiber, and moderating avocado intake resolves this issue.

Although rare, some individuals with latex allergies can also experience allergic reactions when consuming avocados. Avocados contain similar proteins to the ones found in latex from rubber trees.

## What Can Help Me To Burn Fat

# What can help me to burn fat?

**Tired of feeling like your metabolism is working against you?** The truth is, your body might be more efficient than you think! To shed that stubborn fat, you need to ignite your body's energy-burning potential.

**The key lies in your mitochondria:** the powerhouses within your cells that convert food into stored energy. By triggering a process called mitochondrial uncoupling, you can shift those powerhouses to generate less stored energy and more heat – essentially "wasting" fuel and promoting fat burning.

**Resveratrol, a natural compound found in various fruits and plants, is your secret weapon.** It acts as a mitochondrial uncoupler, and studies show that incorporating a daily tablespoon of resveratrol powder can help reduce belly fat.

**But resveratrol isn't the only solution:** Ketones, cold therapy, exercise, fasting, green tea, saunas, and even Jacuzzis can also stimulate mitochondrial uncoupling.

**Maximize your results by avoiding factors that hinder this process:**

- **Limit excess calories:** Fuel your body efficiently, not excessively.

- **Stay active:** Combat the effects of aging and a sedentary lifestyle.

- **Minimize heavy metal exposure:** Protect your mitochondria from toxins.

- **Review your medications:** Discuss potential impacts with your doctor.

**By embracing these strategies, you can unlock your metabolism's full potential and finally conquer that stubborn fat.** Remember, it's not about having a slow metabolism; it's about harnessing your body's power to burn energy efficiently.

## How Can I Guarantee Sustainable Weight Loss

# How can I guarantee sustainable weight loss?

Guaranteeing Sustainable Weight Loss

**1\. Manage Carbohydrate Intake**

Opt for nutrient-rich, whole foods over refined carbs. Incorporate fruits, vegetables, and whole grains for fiber and essential nutrients. Consider lower-carb diets like keto or paleo under professional guidance.

**2\. Incorporate Healthy Fats and Proteins**

Include sources of healthy fats such as avocados, nuts, and olive oil, and lean proteins like chicken, fish, and legumes. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight to maintain muscle mass and support recovery.

**3\. Combine Effective Strategies**

Integrate the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting for enhanced fat burning and improved insulin sensitivity. For those post-gastric sleeve surgery, intermittent fasting can aid in maintaining weight loss and managing hunger.

Sustainable weight loss is a gradual process requiring balanced nutrition and consistent strategies. Celebrate progress and maintain a long-term focus for lasting success.

## How To Optimize Protein Intake During Intermittent Fasting

# How to optimize protein intake during intermittent fasting?

**Optimizing Fat Loss and Muscle Preservation with a Ketogenic Diet and Intermittent Fasting**

Combining a ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting is an effective strategy for enhancing fat loss while preserving muscle mass. To maximize benefits, strategically time your protein intake during your eating window.

**Adjusting Protein Intake**

Distribute your protein intake evenly across meals. Aim for 21 to 42 grams of high-quality protein per meal to support muscle protein synthesis and satiety.

**Fasting and Muscle Preservation**

Intermittent fasting helps preserve muscle mass during calorie restriction by increasing growth hormone release, which supports lean tissue maintenance and fat burning. Studies suggest that intermittent fasting may reduce the protein required for muscle maintenance, allowing for slightly lower protein intake while still benefiting from muscle preservation.

# How do I incorporate nightshades into my diet?

**Incorporating Nightshades into Your Diet**

**Balance Your Nutrient Intake:** Nightshade vegetables can be a valuable addition to your diet when consumed in moderation. To maximize their benefits, pair them with other nutrient-dense foods like leafy greens and fatty fish.

**Dietary Considerations:** For those on specialized diets, such as ketogenic or intermittent fasting, nightshades can be included in moderation. Ensure they align with your dietary goals and monitor for any sensitivities or adverse effects.

# Dairy and Plant-Based Proteins

[Dairy and plant-based proteins](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-ketogenic-diet-and-the-dairy) can be healthy choices, but it's important to know what to look for to make the best decisions for your health.

Most commercially available milk undergoes high-temperature processing that kills harmful bacteria, ensuring it's safe to drink.

This technique not only safeguards the milk by annihilating dangerous bacteria but also prolongs its usability, offering added convenience to shoppers.

## How Can I Tell If Something Is Healthy On Keto

# How can I tell if something is healthy on Keto?

Not all foods marketed as "keto" are truly healthy. Despite being under 50 grams of net carbs, some contain resistant starches like tapioca and maltodextrin, classified as fiber but impacting insulin differently. These starches are often derived from corn starch and can be misleading on labels.

To ensure you're making healthy choices, read ingredient labels carefully and look for hidden starches and sugars. Stay informed by following reliable sources for up-to-date information on keto-friendly foods.

## Which Is Worse A High Carb Diet Or Snacking For Weight Loss

# Which is worse: a high carb diet or snacking for weight loss?

Snacking is actually worse than a high-carb diet when it comes to weight loss. Both increase insulin, but frequent snacking keeps insulin levels elevated throughout the day, preventing fat loss. For example, when I stopped snacking, even on seemingly healthy options like apples with peanut butter, I lost a significant amount of weight. Research has shown that snacking is a major contributor to obesity, more so than even high-carb diets.

Historically, people ate three meals a day with minimal snacking, and obesity rates were much lower. The modern habit of frequent snacking keeps insulin levels high, giving the pancreas no time to recover. This constant stimulation of insulin can be detrimental to your health.

Intermittent fasting is a powerful alternative that simplifies your eating routine and reduces hunger over time, making it an effective strategy for both weight loss and improving overall health.

## Whats Healthier Chicken Or Pork

# What's healthier chicken or pork?

Typically, commercial chicken and pork from a grocery store are highly processed. I never recommend consuming that type of meat.

**Problems with processed meat:**

• It’s factory farmed 

• The animals consume GMO grains 

• The animals are given antibiotics 

• The animals are given drugs that are arsenic-based 

• The animals are given formaldehyde 

Personally, I prefer pork because it’s fattier meat. If you have chicken with skin, the skin does provide some fattiness. Just remember that if you’re on the ketogenic diet, you want more fat in your diet. Lean meats stimulate insulin levels more than fatty meats. Pork would be better on your insulin levels.

## How Much Mct Oil Should I Put In My Coffee

# How much MCT oil should I put in my coffee?

I would do a tablespoon of MCT.If you do too much, you'll have diarrhea or loose bowels.

If you exercise, you know, add another tablespoon, it'll give you more energy because it's gonna generate ketones. If you go too much you're gonna burn that as your fuel more than your own body fat. And if you're trying to increase your weight or maintain your weight, then that's totally fine. But if you're trying to lose weight, you wanna be careful about these extra added fats.

## Why Am I Losing Inches But Not Weight

# Why am I losing inches but not weight?

**There is nothing more frustrating than doing everything right with keto and intermittent fasting, and still not losing weight.** 

**Even if you're losing inches but not losing weight, the ketogenic diet is still working:**

• If you're losing inches

• If your hunger is going away

• If you're not craving anymore

• If you have more energy

A slow metabolism really is insulin resistance. Insulin is an anabolic hormone. If insulin is not working, you're not going to have the anabolic effect. As soon as you do keto and intermittent fasting, you're going to fix insulin resistance.  Once you fix insulin resistance, you're going to absorb more protein. Protein weighs more than fat per the same volume. This means, initially, you will lose inches but not weight. 

**This is because you're:**

• Absorbing protein

• Getting more muscle mass

• Fixing atrophy 

If you're not losing weight on keto, keep in mind that it is working. You're getting healthier. You have to get healthy to lose weight, not lose weight to get healthy.

## What Can I Do If I Cant Do Low Carb Diet

# What can I do if I can't do low carb diet?

1\. You can eat please foods

2\. You will not be as hungry

3\. You will not crave

4\. The sensation of getting healthy is better than the sensation of food

5\. More energy and more vitality

6\. You will not be able to come off medication unless you reduce your insulin through food.

## Cauliflower Non Potato Pancakes Recipe

# Cauliflower "Non-Potato" Pancakes Recipe

One of the biggest comfort foods for Karen growing up in Pennsylvania was potato pancakes. She really wanted to find a low-carb alternative to potato pancakes, and cauliflower works perfectly. 

This is a really easy recipe. You don't have to steam the cauliflower, you just mix up the ingredients, and it fries up really nicely. We love to make them in a cast iron pan and serve them warm with sour cream. This is another great recipe to help you get plenty of cruciferous. I think you're really going to love it. 

**Cauliflower 'Non-potato' Pancakes**

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup shredded cauliflower

- ½ cup shredded mozzarella

- 1 egg (If small, use 2.)

- ¼ cup almond flour

- ¼ cup finely chopped onion

- 1 tbl parsley

- 1 tsp salt,

- ½ tsp pepper  

**Directions:**

- Mix all ingredients.

- Heat skillet and add oil until hot. I love the cast iron skillet for this. 

- Drop a mound in the hot pan (about ¼ cup) and press down gently. Let one side become fully brown before turning.  Brown second side.

- Move to a plate with a paper towel to remove excess oil. 

- You may want a little more salt on top.

- Serve warm with a dollop of sour cream.

These are AMAZING!!!

## Keto Cinnamon Roll Bites Recipe

# Keto Cinnamon Roll Bites Recipe

If you're on a low-carbohydrate diet, this is the perfect alternative to cinnamon rolls. This is a small recipe, perfectly proportioned. It's a great recipe to have on hand if you're on a low-carbohydrate diet, and you want a healthy treat. 

**Low-carb Cinnamon Roll Bites**

**Ingredients:**

This is a small batch recipe that will yield about 8 roll bites.

- 1 scoop vanilla protein powder (I recommend pea protein/Stevie blend.)

- ½ tsp baking powder

- 1 tbl coconut flour

- ½ tsp cinnamon

- 1 tbl powdered sugar-free sweetener of choice

- 1 large egg

- ¼ cup unsweetened almond milk

- ¼ tsp vanilla extract

**Directions:**

Mix all dry ingredients together. Beat egg. Add vanilla and milk and mix well. Add wet ingredients to dry and mix well with a wooden spoon, until well-blended.

Spray the mini muffin pan or use paper muffin cups. Put one heaping teaspoon of batter into each well/cup. Bake at 350 for 13 minutes (or until a toothpick is clean when pulled from roll). Remove carefully from the pan and cool on a rack.

For a sweeter, more traditional cinnamon roll, you can mix a tsp of sugar alternative fine powder sweetener like "Just Like Sugar for Baking," with 2 tsp melted coconut oil or butter, and a pinch of cinnamon or as desired. Mix and drizzle over roll when fully cooled.

## Keto Zucchini Goat Cheese Rolls

# Keto Zucchini Goat Cheese Rolls

This homemade zucchini goat cheese roll recipe is a great low-carb snack. But, by snack, we mean that you should have them more as a small meal rather than in-between your meals. Zucchini can be pretty bland, but this healthy keto recipe really spices it up. This is a zucchini roll with herb goat cheese and capers. It’s really lovely and delicious. You can make these rolls as small or as large as you want. They also make a really beautiful side dish. 

**ZUCCHINI GOAT CHEESE ROLLS**

**Ingredients:**

- zucchini goat cheese (or your favorite soft cheese)

- Your favorite herbs (or make it easy and buy herb cheese!).

- You can go Italian, with oregano and garlic, or savory, with Thyme and parsley - whatever you like.

- capers

**Directions:**

- Mix herbs into cheese until fully blended.

- Slice zucchini thinly, about 1/8 inch.

- Press slices between two paper towels to pull out extra moisture.

- Grill until tender, or bake at 375 until tender but not mushy for about 15 minutes.

- Cool slightly. Press again between paper towels.

- Spread cheese onto ¾ of zucchini slice.

- Add 2-3 capers to the end with cheese on it. 

- Roll them up! You can put toothpick in them or just rest on a plate and serve.

- The larger/thicker the slices of zucchini, the larger the roll.   

- For small bites (appetizers) you’ll want to keep them thinner. But a larger roll is a gorgeous side, for the dinner plate. 

**Enjoy!**

## Keto Low Carb Blueberry Mini Bites

# Keto Low Carb Blueberry Mini Bites

If you're on a low-carb diet weight loss journey, this is a fantastic keto-friendly low-carb recipe for muffin bites that you can have as a healthy treat when you really need one.

Right now, there is a craze called mug cakes. It's a really cool concept that you have a small number of ingredients that you mix in mug and pop in the microwave to have as a single serving cake. This is a cool theory, but it relies on a microwave, which we don't feel good about using. 

These recipes turn out way better in the oven over the microwave anyway. We also realized that having a mug full of cake was just too much. So, we made these muffin bites that are perfectly proportioned, they don't have regular sugar or flour, and they're delicious! 

Have these delicious muffin bites with a meal.  Low Carb Blueberry Muffin Bites  

**Makes 8 bites. Ingredients:**

1 tbl coconut flour

2 tbl almond flour

2 tbl granulated sugar of choice

½ tsp baking powder (aluminum free, always!)

1 large organic egg

1tbl melted organic butter or Ghee

1tbl unsweetened almond milk

3 tbl frozen blueberries

**Directions:**

Grease a mini muffin pan or use cups.

Mix all dry ingredients. Separately, mix all wet ingredients.

Blend wet into dry and mix well with wooden spoon until most lumps are gone.

This recipe tends to produce a VERY runny batter. No worries. Pour into cups or wells until about half full, or distribute evenly until all batter has been used.

Bake at 350 for about 12 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.

Gently remove from pan and cool on rack. Enjoy!

## Best Keto Crackers

# Best Keto Crackers

I believe the best keto cracker is the “Finn Crisp Thin Rye Crispbread.” You might be able to find these at a health food store or online. You could add sour cream, cheese, guacamole, or hummus with these as well.

These keto crackers are whole-grain rye crackers. They have a very small amount of gluten, but if you’re gluten-sensitive, these might not be an option.

## Keto Biscuits Recipe

# Keto Biscuits Recipe

A lot of people love to have a nice biscuit or piece of bread with butter. While on the ketogenic diet, you can have grass-fed butter, but traditional breads and biscuits are not an option. This is the perfect low-carb alternative if you’re on the keto diet, but you still want to have something that’s like bread or a biscuit. Put grass-fed butter on it or oil with Italian spices. They’re easy and delicious. 

These biscuits are very bread-like, so you could slice it for sandwiches or toast it! Yum! This recipe is for ONE biscuit. But you can easily double it, triple it, etc. - as much as you want and fill as many muffin cups as you like. Make enough, and you can even make a loaf. 

**Keto Biscuits Recipe:**

1 tbl coconut flour

2 tbl ground flaxseed

1 egg

1 tsp Kerrygold butter ½ tsp baking powder

2 grinds (pinches) of salt

**Directions:**

Mix and put in greased ramekins/muffin cups/loaf pan. Bake at 350 for 15 minutes. When using a loaf pan, 25 minutes will be needed. Test with knife or toothpick, to see to it that it comes out clean and to ensure doneness.

## Keto Cranberry Pecan Muffins Recipe

# Keto Cranberry Pecan Muffins Recipe

These low-carb cranberry pecan muffins are amazing, and they are completely keto-friendly. There is no regular flour or sugar in this recipe. I like to use Kerrygold grass-fed butter on top. Even my kids love these delicious muffins, and I think you're going to love them too. 

The cranberries in this recipe are ok because cranberries are tart, they don't have a lot of sugar. You're also allowed between 20 and 50 grams of carbs per day with a ketogenic diet. You don't have to feel deprived on the ketogenic diet. Great recipes like this one are delicious and will even make the house smell great!

**Cranberry Pecan Muffins Recipe**

**Ingredients**

• ½ cup sour cream

• 4 large organic, pasture-raised eggs

• 1 tsp vanilla

• 3 cups almond flour

• ½ tsp cinnamon

• 2 tsp baking powder (aluminum-free)

• ½ cup sugar-free sweetener (I use Just Like Sugar)

• ¼ tsp salt

• 1 cup fresh or frozen/thawed cranberries (If frozen, they must be fully thawed and drained.)

• ½ cup pecans (nuts are optional)

**Directions**

1\. Preheat oven at 325°F. 

2\. Line the muffin tin with cups or use silicone liners.

3\. In a blender, mix sour cream, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, baking powder, sweetener, and salt. Blend until well-mixed. 

4\. Add almond flour mixture a bit at a time and blend. If it gets too thick, add water until it can blend into a batter. Mix well.

5\. Add cranberries and nuts and mix with a spatula. (If it's easier for you, you can pour the batter into a large bowl or mix the whole thing in a bowl. You'll still end up with yummy cranberry muffins.) 

6\. Using a ¼ cup or a spoon, pour the batter into the muffin cups, dividing the batter evenly into 12. 

7\. Bake for 25-30 minutes until the muffins are slightly brown and firm to touch. Let them cool at room temperature because warm muffins will stick to the paper.

## How Can I Permanently Stick To A Weight Loss Plan

# How can I permanently stick to a weight loss plan?

**The biggest reasons people can’t stick to a diet are #1 hunger and #2 cravings.** 

**There are two main hormones involved in hunger and cravings:**

1\. Ghrelin — This hormone makes you hungry, so we want to decrease it. 

2\. Leptin — This hormone makes you feel satisfied, so we want to increase it. 

**The best ways to stick with your eating plan and lose weight:**

• Get more sleep 

• Decrease sugar 

• Consume an adequate amount of protein

• Get plenty of fiber 

• Decrease stress 

• Avoid alcohol and smoking 

• Keep caffeine consumption to a minimum 

• Consume healthy fats 

• Eat slowly 

• Decrease carbohydrates 

• Take l-tryptophan (for cravings during menstrual cycles)

• Consume nutrient-dense foods 

• Do intermittent fasting

Gastric bypass and certain medications can also increase hunger. 

One of the big tips for sticking to diets and losing weight is to eat frequent small meals. But, every time you eat, you increase insulin.  In the presence of insulin, you can’t burn fat, and if you can’t burn fat, then you can’t lose weight. This can also cause insulin resistance, which can lead to a myriad of health concerns.  Eating less frequently, also known as intermittent fasting, is one of the best things you can do to lose weight and support your overall health. 

To stay satisfied between meals without eating snacks, you need to feed the cells your body fat (burn fat). But, to burn fat, you have to lower your insulin by lowering your carbohydrates and eating less frequently.  Once your body has adapted to burning fat, not only will you be able to lose weight, you will finally get rid of hunger and cravings for good.

## Whats The 1 Best Food For Brain

# What's the #1 best food for brain?

It’s a misconception that the brain can't regenerate—certain parts of the brain can regrow.

**The top foods to avoid to support a healthy brain are:**

1\. Omega-6 fatty acids (soy oil, corn oil, canola oil, and cottonseed oil)

2\. Sugar

3\. Refined carbs

The best food to support brain health is wild-caught salmon.

**Wild-caught salmon can help enhance the brain in many ways, including supporting:**

• Memory

• Focus

• Thinking

• Problem-solving

• Learning

It may also be beneficial for those with mood disorders or brain inflammation. Consuming more wild-caught salmon may even help reduce insulin resistance, which is at the core of many brain problems. The brain is the fattiest organ in the body. Omega-3 fatty acids are the healthy fats your brain needs. They’re the building blocks of your brain. Wild-caught salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids.

Wild-caught salmon is keto-friendly. It’s low-carb and has a good amount of protein and nutrients. But, to get these incredible benefits for the brain, be sure the salmon you choose is wild-caught and not farm-raised. Try having your salmon with a kale salad topped with olive oil and unfortified nutritional yeast to take your brain health to the next level.

**Ingredients for the salad dressing base:**

1/3 cup (2.5 ounces) extra virgin olive oil

1/4 cup (2 ounces) apple cider vinegar

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) lemon juice

## What Are Some Effective Dietary Sources For Increasing Glucose Levels

# What are some effective dietary sources for increasing glucose levels?

People often have an idea that your body — especially your brain — can only run on glucose. But that’s not true! You can run your body on ketones, which provide about forty to seventy percent of the energy you need. Of course, the question becomes, what kind of fuel makes up the difference? There will always be a small amount of glucose, but your body can run on fatty acids. Fat turns into ketones and fatty acids.

Your brain is a little different; it can use ketones for seventy percent of its fuel, with the rest coming from lactate or glucose. Where will you get the glucose if you don’t want to eat carbohydrates? Your body makes its own, in a process called gluconeogenesis. Your body uses fat and protein to make glucose. Certain amino acids in protein turn into glucose, as does a component of fat which breaks down into glycerol, then converts to glucose. Your body can easily get the glucose it needs from fat and protein. You don’t need carbohydrates to supply glucose.

## How Do I Make A Keto Waffle

# How do I make a keto waffle?

This is a recipe for a classic almond flour waffle. But you can do so much more with this waffles recipe than just make classic waffles. If you pull a few ingredients from this recipe, you can get a really nice “bready” texture. If you miss bread, the resulting waffle bread can be a great alternative.

**Amazing Low-Carb Waffles Ingredients:**

1 cup almond flour

1 pinch salt

1 tsp baking soda

4 eggs (organic, pasture-raised)

1⁄4 cup FiberYum\\cooking spray (for example, avocado spray)

**Instructions:**

1\. Heat waffle iron per the directions that came with it.

2\. Mix all ingredients above. Do not overmix.

3\. Spray both sides of iron with oil before batter is poured in. Pour batter in and cook per the directions that came with your waffle iron. All are different!

4\. These are best served right away. If not, put them on a cookie sheet and don’t stack. They tend to get soft when stacked.

5\. Add butter and sugar-free syrup or peanut butter, and enjoy!

The following super-easy waffle bread is a variation on the waffle recipe, and cooked just like the waffles above, or as pancakes. The texture and taste make this great to use as a bread replacement! Try it out!

**Waffle Bread
Ingredients:**

1 cup almond flour

1⁄4 tsp salt

1 tsp baking soda

3 Tbsp Fiber Yum (or Vitafiber, etc.) cooking spray for the pan or waffle iron

You can try adding different nuts, seeds, or herbs to this recipe. One with dried onion and poppy will taste like a bagel and would be great with cream cheese. Another one could be made with sunflower and pumpkin seeds, and another with shredded carrots and zucchini. Play with it!

Use the rounds (pancake-size) as “bread” for a cheeseburger – amazing. And it’s fun for the kids to get a sandwich on waffle bread!

Enjoy!

## Can I Consume Green Apples On Keto

# Can I consume green apples on keto?

No. If you look up the nutritional profile of an apple, this is what you’ll find:

- Saturated fats – .1 g

- Cholesterol – 0 g

- Carbohydrates – 25 g

- Fiber – 44 g

- Sugar – 19 g

Apples have enough sugar to stop fat burning for at least one to two days. At least until you’re at your ideal weight, consuming apples (or any fruit) is probably not a good idea.

What should you snack on? You actually shouldn’t snack at all. Any time you eat, especially sugar, you spike insulin. In the presence of insulin, you can’t burn fat. It’s good to keep insulin very low. If you can’t go without snacking, you need to increase the amount of fat you consume in your meal. Fat helps keep you satisfied and helps keep insulin low.

## What Steps Can I Take To Successfully Return To A Ketogenic Diet

# What steps can I take to successfully return to a ketogenic diet?

To regain consistency on a ketogenic diet, consider the following strategies:

1\. **Maintain a Food Log**: Documenting your meals can help you stay accountable and understand your eating patterns.

2\. **Clarify Your Motivations**: Reflect on your reasons for adopting keto, emphasizing health benefits and the enjoyment of food, including keto-friendly desserts.

3\. **Avoid Cycles of Dietary Change**: Repeatedly switching between diets can confuse your metabolism. Commit to a consistent approach.

4\. **Follow Healthy Keto® Guidelines**: Focus on a diet with moderate protein intake, limit carbohydrates to 10 grams per day if necessary, and ensure a minimum of 75 grams of dietary fat.

5\. **Incorporate Intermittent Fasting**: This practice can enhance metabolic flexibility and support your ketogenic goals.

6\. **Prioritize Sleep**: Adequate rest is essential for metabolic stability.

7\. **Engage in Regular Exercise**: Physical activity contributes to overall health and can aid in maintaining ketosis.

8\. **Manage Stress Levels**: Stress can negatively impact metabolism, so find effective strategies to manage it.

By implementing these practices, you can effectively transition back to a ketogenic lifestyle and enhance your chances of long-term success.

## Why Am I So Thirsty On Keto

# Why am I so thirsty on keto?

You probably are not producing enough saliva. On keto specifically, you are not taking any starches (hopefully), and they make the body produce saliva. But another factor is electrolytes. To prevent thirst on keto: increase the amount of vegetables or take a good electrolyte powder and make sure to increase the amount of sea salt because it will help you establish a better hydration.

---

## Why Am I Losing Muscle On Keto

# Why am I losing muscle on keto?

This could be due to low protein in your diet and a lack of exercise.

When you don’t want to lose muscle mass while doing intermittent fasting, add strength training as a part of your workout, loading up muscle to recruit as many muscle fibers as you can.

- Go heavy weight with a lower number of reps

- Go moderate amount of weight to failure

    Or you can do a combination of both the above. These two actions can create a hypertrophic effect on the muscles which can keep them bigger and prevent them from shrinking when you are doing keto and intermittent fasting.

---

## Can Keto Cause Diarrhea

# Can Keto cause diarrhea?

Diarrhea on a ketogenic diet can occur for several reasons. One common cause is that your body may not be accustomed to digesting the higher levels of saturated fat required on keto. To address this, consider reducing your intake of oils such as MCT oil, butter, and coconut oil to see if symptoms improve.

Additionally, excessive consumption of certain vegetables can overwhelm gut microbes. It's advisable to stick to more easily digestible options like lettuce, cucumber, tomato, and bell pepper, gradually reintroducing other vegetables as your gut adapts. Incorporating fermented vegetables can also support gut health.

With time and appropriate dietary adjustments, diarrhea should subside as your body adapts to the ketogenic diet.

---

## What Sugar Or Carbs Can I Eat On Intermittent Fasting

# What sugar or carbs can I eat on intermittent fasting?

Intermittent fasting doesn’t necessarily require you to not eat carbs or sugar. You can eat them if you want, although it will not be effective.

Doing intermittent fasting and the keto diet together brings the best benefits. In which case you should only eat 20 to 50 g net carbs a day, meaning total carbs minus fiber.

If you crave sweetness, check for some safe keto-friendly alternatives like stevia or monk fruit.

---

## Why Do I Still Have Acne On Keto

# Why do I still have acne on keto?

Normally, keto helps with acne by addressing underlying hormonal issues. Persistent acne may indicate high androgens, which increase skin oiliness. Androgens often rise due to high insulin levels, potentially from hidden sugars or artificial sweeteners. Implement intermittent fasting with your keto diet to help manage insulin levels.

Stress can also trigger cortisol release, spiking insulin and causing acne. Reduce stress by taking daily 45-minute walks, avoiding stress triggers, and consuming nutritional yeast.

To address acne, check food labels for hidden carbs or sugars, add healthy fats, consume purified bile salts, practice intermittent fasting, and eat 7 to 10 cups of vegetables daily. Additionally, consume probiotics or fermented vegetables. If stress is a problem, improve sleep, take naps, and continue with long outdoor walks.

## Why Do We Only Need A Moderate Amount Of Protein On Keto

# Why do we only need a moderate amount of protein on keto?

This is because 3 oz to 6 oz of protein per meal won’t spike your insulin levels. (This amount may vary depending on your fitness level, metabolism and ability to digest protein.)

You also want to consider your fasting schedule. If you are only eating one meal a day, you may want to add a little more protein to your meal.

Consume grass-fed, grass-finished beef, pasture-raised chicken (with the skin) and eggs as well as wild-caught salmon as good protein sources. Always go for the fattier proteins as that will contribute to lower insulin levels.

## Can I Do Ketogenic Diet And Intermittent Fasting If Im Underweight

# Can I do ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting if I'm underweight?

The answer is keto and IF is not just good for weight loss, but for anti-aging, inflammation, cognitive health, mood, and the list go on and on. If you don't need to lose weight, just add more fat to your meals. This will stop the weight loss, so your body will burn the dietary fats and not your own fat.

## Are High Ketones During Fasting Dangerous

# Are high ketones during fasting dangerous?

Ketoacidosis is a serious health concern that can have devastating health consequences. However, having ketones in the blood during a fast is rarely cause for alarm. In fact, it is often an indicator that your body is burning fat.

Ketoacidosis primarily happens to diabetics who don’t take the right amount of insulin. Ketoacidosis is very different from nutritional ketosis, which is beneficial and will result in ketone levels in the body being raised.

## Im On The Weight Loss Journey   Can I Eat Healthy Snacks

# I'm on the weight loss journey - can I eat healthy snacks?

People will tell you that in order to lose weight, you need to snack before you get too hungry, or snack to trigger your metabolism or snack to prevent overeating. 

It's snacking camouflaged as "Healthy snacking". All these extra meals even if they are small and healthy create a spike in insulin - this adds up. 

Insulin is the FAT-MAKING hormone, AND IT PREVENTS FAT BURNING. We snack on liquids too. The grocery store is filled with all sorts of new snacks protein bars, jerky, drinks, and granola bars, with added buzz words like "gluten free" or "organic" or "natural", but it's still food. 

Even fruit between meals can block weight loss. I myself cut fruit out between meals and went from 211 pounds to 185 pounds in 6 weeks.

## Im Not Losing Weight On Keto What Am I Doing Wrong

# I'm not losing weight on Keto, what am I doing wrong?

\### Key Tips for Succeeding on the Keto Diet

1\. **Focus on Fat, Not Carbs**: Your body burns fat only when glucose is absent. Avoid hidden carbs like maltodextrin and tapioca starch. Aim for less than 10 grams of carbs per day.

2\. **Mind Your Eating Habits**: Eating too frequently, consuming sugar alcohols, certain nuts, cheese, or specific vegetables can cause bloating and constipation. Snacking spikes insulin, leading to belly fat. Consider intermittent fasting to reduce insulin spikes.

3\. **Adjust for Age and Metabolism**: People over 40 may benefit from eating one meal a day (OMAD) due to a slower metabolism.

4\. **Understand Menopause and Metabolism**: During menopause, cortisol spikes can cause muscle atrophy, which may appear as fat. Keto helps rebuild muscle and heal insulin resistance over time.

5\. **Moderate Protein Intake**: Too much protein can raise insulin levels. Aim for 3-6 ounces per meal, up to 8 ounces if very active.

6\. **Prioritize Health Over Weight Loss**: Focus on overall health improvements, like increased energy, better cognitive function, and improved sleep, to support weight loss and well-being.

By following these guidelines, you'll not only enhance your chances of weight loss but also enjoy various health benefits on the keto diet.

## Are Keto Snacks Safe To Eat On A Ketogenic Diet

# Are Keto snacks safe to eat on a Ketogenic Diet?

**There are so many different kinds of keto snacks available now, like protein bars, keto bombs, and much more. But, these keto snacks can actually decrease your results significantly. You’re going to plateau.** 

The goal of keto is to decrease and normalize insulin. Every time you eat anything of significant calories, you will spike insulin. So, the more frequent the meals, the more insulin you’re going to have, and the less progress you’re going to make with weight loss and your overall health. 

Low-calorie foods like vegetables won’t spike insulin too much, especially if it’s filled with fiber, like leafy greens. So, this could be an exception. 

Let’s say you’re doing intermittent fasting, and your first meal is at 12 pm, and your next meal is at 7 pm. But, you have a snack in between because this time is technically your eating window. I don’t recommend doing this. I don’t recommend eating anything during the day except for during your first meal and second meal. So, after 7 pm, you would fast again until 12 pm the next day. To really see some significant changes, you may want to work up to an 18 hour fast. However, some people may need to go up to 20 hours or even 23 hours of fasting. 

A lot of keto snacks and keto bombs are okay to have, but you should only eat them with your meal.

## Is Coconut Milk Or Water Keto Friendly

# Is coconut milk or water keto-friendly?

**Canned coconut milk (1 cup):**

Fat—58g

Carb—13g

Fiber—5g

Net carb—8g

Potassium—631g

**Silk coconut milk (1 cup):**

Fat—4g

Carb—1g

Potassium—310g

Depending on what type of coconut milk you get, it’s going to be more or less keto-friendly, but even 8g of carbs aren’t too bad. You just want to make sure you have less than 20g-30g of carbs per day to really get into ketosis.

**Overall, is coconut milk keto-friendly? Yes.** And, it works great in coffee and in all kinds of keto-friendly recipes.

**Coconut water (1 cup):**

Fat—0.5g

Carb—11g

Potassium—600mg

Sodium—282mg

A lot of people consume coconut water for electrolytes because the potassium/sodium ratio is pretty good. I do think the carbs are a bit too high for keto. But, depending on how many other carbs you have in a day, you may still be able to get away with it. It’s definitely much better than juice or soda.

## Whats The Best Nut For Keto

# What's the best nut for Keto?

Today we’re going to cover the best types of nuts to have on a healthy keto diet. To find out what the best keto nuts are, I took the total carbs and subtracted the fiber to get the net carbs.

• Pecans: Total carbs (14g) - Fiber (10g) = Net carbs (4g) Fat = (71)

• Walnuts: Total carbs (11g) - Fiber (5g) = Net carbs (6g) Fat = (52)

• Almonds: Total carbs (20g) - Fiber (11g) = Net carbs (9g) Fat = (45)

• Pine nuts: Total carbs (18g) - Fiber (5g) = Net carbs 13g) Fat = (92)

• Almond butter: Total carbs (47g) - Fiber (26g) = Net carbs (21g) Fat = (139)
