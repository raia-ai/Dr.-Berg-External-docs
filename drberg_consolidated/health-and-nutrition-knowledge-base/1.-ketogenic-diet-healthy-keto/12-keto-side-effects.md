You're going to be aware of the allergy more because as you clean up your diet some of these other things are going to show up more before it might've you just been numb to it. The other thing too is with the wheat and stuff is that it actually has a morphine effect so it can numb you.

## Can I Eat Quinoa On Keto

# Can I eat quinoa on Keto?

Quinoa is a seed from a tall leafy plant that grows up to 3 to 9ft. It is very low on the glycemic index but it can still spike your blood sugars. It is gluten-free but it is processed in many factories that also process wheat - so it could be exposed to glute. And it has a similar compound to gluten that could also create a similar inflammatory reaction in the gut.
