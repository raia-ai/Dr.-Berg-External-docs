- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=0s)** — If you find yourself looking like this by your computer, because you're sitting there all day like I used to get from working on the computer for 13 hours a day, you're going to get a lot of tension in your neck, in your back, and you're going to keep trying to raise your posture up. But then as soon as you forget about it, you come right back down to this position right here. Today, we're going to show you how to completely reverse that, to put your head over your body and keep it there. You're about to learn an amazing
- **[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=30s)** — fascial stretch that will take your posture from slouched to completely upright. When I was in practice for 30 years, I didn't learn about fascia. Fascia is the thing that gives the shape around the body, and fascia extends way beyond the joints. You're about to learn a routine that I recommend you do every single night until you commit it to memory. I do these stretches before bed to be able to take your posture from down here to all the way up here. So go ahead and save this video and follow this routine
- **[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=59s)** — step by step as we take you through these simple exercises to transform your fascia. Let's begin. For this one, you're going to need some type of rod or pole. Maybe you could take a broom and unscrew the bottom of the broom. If you don't have something around the house, maybe you can get something like this, like a band, where you can hold this in back of your head. Now for this one, it's really important that you maintain a really good posture. So when you start out doing this, you might be very, very stiff.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=89s)** — But try to do the best you can. So we're going to be holding some type of pole or some elastic band as far back as you can as you laterally bend to one side. So we're going to start off going to the right side, go to neutral, and go to the left side. This is one of my favorite exercises. And I'll tell you, if you're sitting all day or you have a lot of stiffness, it's going to greatly open up your rib cage, your upper back, and you'd be surprised how much your neck is going to be very loose when you're done with this.
- **[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=119s)** — Again, this is working on the entire fascia that extends beyond just the joints in your shoulders and your neck, because all this fascia connects down also through your lower back. It's very rare that we actually stretch in this lateral motion.
- **[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=134s)** — All right, for this next one, we're going to be doing rotation. Now, this is going to really help the upper rib cage, your shoulders as well as your neck. Of course, you're going to be standing, we're going to take that same pole or that elastic band, and we're going to rotate starting to the right side. And so as you rotate all the way to the right side, you're going to kind of pause, try to go as far as you can pause and hold that. And then go around to the other side, pause and hold that position. We're going to go back and forth, repetitively.
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=165s)** — Here's another motion that we rarely get as we sit behind a desk all day. And that's rotation. Usually you're going to find one side is going to be more restricted. So you're going to work on that until you have symmetry between the left and right side. All right, good. You should already start feeling more relaxed. And you probably notice that your breathing is more calm as well. All right, in this next routine, this is one of my favorite ones, because when I first started doing this, I was very, very stiff. We're going to extend back as far as we can.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=194s)** — Going backwards, and then back up to neutral. Now what you're stretching in this motion is all of the connective tissue and the fascia on the front part of the rib cage underneath your clavicle, through the abdomen. So we're stretching all that as we go backwards, even though you might feel it in your back as well, because you're also stretching some of the fascia that is inside your body on the front part of your spine. Okay, now we approach the last exercise in the routine.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=229s)** — This one I call the matrix. All right, so this is how you do this. Make sure your legs are about shoulder width apart. Bring your arms out to the side and you're going to flex to your left side first with your arms out to the side.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=242s)** — Now, as you laterally flex all the way down to one side, you're now going to raise your left arm up and your right arm backwards. I don't know if you've ever saw the movie The Matrix, but this is like avoiding the bullet.
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=253s)** — And then we're going to twist over on the right side and laterally flex and do the same motion, bringing your right arm up and your left arm back. And then we're going to repeat to the opposite side.
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=265s)** — This might take a little while to get down, but just watch the person doing this and try to mimic them as close as possible.
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=272s)** — So as you're doing this motion, you're going to find that this is like the ultimate in lateral flexion, rotation and extension with your shoulders. You're taking this fascia and you are just stretching it out, creating a lot of space in your upper back and your neck.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=290s)** — When you're done with this, you're going to sleep like a baby. You're going to feel real good. It's a wonderful exercise if you get stiff and also just to exercise your fascia.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=298s)** — Do this routine every day until you actually get it down as a habit and you remember these motions, then you don't need to watch it. But this is a great routine. I do this every single night. It really helps sleeping and it's really good for posture and neck pain as well.
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnS87AnnR0&t=313s)** — Alright, so we're done and I will see you tomorrow.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=0s)** — This is why I stretch every single day. Here are the benefits that I found personally with myself.
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=6s)** — It helps my sleep. It helps reduce pain and decrease inflammation.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=10s)** — It takes me out of what's called the fight-or-flight mode.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=13s)** — And I also stretch to counter all of the injuries that I've had over the years.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=17s)** — Most people have this confusion that the problem is the muscle.
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=20s)** — The muscle is too tight, so I need to stretch. That's actually not true.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=23s)** — What really becomes tight is something that we're going to talk about called the fascia.
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=27s)** — If you think of a wetsuit that surrounds the entire body, that would be fascia.
- **[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=31s)** — And the thing about fascia, it's totally connected.
- **[00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=34s)** — There's a very interesting short clip I want to share with you on the dynamics of how living or how alive your fascia is.
- **[00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=43s)** — Check this out.
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=44s)** — Alain Langevin of the National Institutes of Health, however, made a bizarre discovery while learning acupuncture.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=50s)** — She noticed that as the needle was inserted into the skin, something seemed to be grabbing and pulling at it.
- **[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=56s)** — When Langevin took these results to the lab, an MRI revealed that the collagen fibers of the fascia were actually winding themselves around the needle, like spaghetti on a fork.
- **[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=66s)** — And what's more, the fibroblasts sent out chemical signals to the surrounding tissue, allowing it to expand and then relax.
- **[01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=73s)** — The fibroblasts that are inside the tissues, up to several centimeters away, not just only at the needle, they expand.
- **[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=81s)** — They respond. It relaxes the tissue.
- **[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=84s)** — So the research is showing that the best thing for fascia is for it to move, to stretch and not be stagnant.
- **[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=89s)** — But what happens if you don't really move at all?
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=91s)** — If you're super sedentary, you haven't tried to touch your toes in a very long time and you have body parts that haven't been through their full range of motion in a long, long while.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=103s)** — When you injure your fascia, you develop scar tissue.
- **[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=106s)** — So what happens, the fascial layers can no longer glide.
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=110s)** — They get stuck together like glue.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=111s)** — Healthy fascia is supposed to be dynamic, movable, flexible, and it even has electrical properties.
- **[01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=118s)** — And unhealthy fascia, especially if it's been injured, develops a disorganized pattern of connective tissue.
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=124s)** — And you might think, oh, I just have stiff muscles.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=126s)** — No, you have a stiff fascia.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=127s)** — And I'm going to teach you really amazing stretches that I do every single night to undo all the bad effects of this accumulated stress that we have in our bodies.
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=137s)** — Probably the worst case scenario fascial problem is when someone has contractures.
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=142s)** — You see people with bad posture that are literally stuck forward and they can't get out of this posture.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=148s)** — So it's very unfortunate where this connective tissue literally keeps you in a frozen state.
- **[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=153s)** — And now it's grown in that way and it's stuck.
- **[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=157s)** — It's very difficult, if not impossible, to undo that.
- **[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=159s)** — If you start to find your body in a certain position, you want to actively and aggressively undo that position so you can keep things erect and keep your motion in your body.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=169s)** — I mean, very similar to when I broke my leg and in just three weeks I had a cast on there.
- **[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=174s)** — Well, when I took that cast off, literally my whole leg and the ankle was just kind of frozen.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=179s)** — I had to undo it.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=180s)** — And yes, there was atrophy of the muscle, but the fascia actually grew in a certain position.
- **[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=186s)** — Why? Because there was no motion.
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=188s)** — I didn't move it.
- **[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=189s)** — And I had to break up those adhesions and get it back to where it should be.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=194s)** — If I just left it like that, it would just literally over time just fuse in that position.
- **[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=198s)** — And so there's a right way to stretch fascia and there's a wrong way.
- **[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=202s)** — But the more that you can elongate that tissue, the better.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=206s)** — Versus just a two-dimensional thing where maybe you're just touching your toes.
- **[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=210s)** — I mean, that might help stretch your lower back, but I'm going to go through a lot deeper stretches.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=214s)** — What you're going to be doing in this first stretch is you're going to be holding this band behind your back,
- **[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=220s)** — stretching all the stuff in the front upper chest and shoulder area.
- **[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=224s)** — This is where we hold a lot of tension and where gravity starts pulling it down.
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=228s)** — So we're going to reverse that.
- **[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=230s)** — Basically leverage using the band behind your back while you are looking in a certain direction
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=237s)** — and creating as much length as possible in that area.
- **[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=242s)** — So I might do this for like 30 seconds and then I relax.
- **[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=245s)** — This will take care of the tension in your back, in the neck and the shoulders.
- **[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=250s)** — Now we're going to stretch the side of your back and underneath your arm and the shoulder all at once,
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=256s)** — where we're doing a lateral bending exercise.
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=260s)** — And this really loosens up your shoulders by stretching in a position that you don't normally stretch in.
- **[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=266s)** — So we're going to do one side and then we'll do the opposite side as well.
- **[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=269s)** — Number three is a very important area because it stretches out a muscle called the psoas.
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=275s)** — Psoas is a muscle in your core that attaches the upper body to the lower legs.
- **[04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=281s)** — And this muscle is the flexor of the hips.
- **[04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=284s)** — This gets tight when we sit all day or we drive long distances.
- **[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=288s)** — So we're going to do this with one leg first.
- **[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=290s)** — And you're just going to mimic what I'm showing you right now.
- **[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=292s)** — So we're stretching one psoas muscle at a time.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=295s)** — Then the next stretch, we're going to stretch both psoas muscles at the same time,
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=300s)** — where you're kneeling and you're bending backwards
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=303s)** — and you're taking all that fascial tension through the core.
- **[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=306s)** — This is like taking your spine and kind of like wringing it out, okay,
- **[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=311s)** — as we stabilize the lower part of the body with one side.
- **[05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=315s)** — And then we'll reverse it and do the opposite side.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=317s)** — All right, this last one kind of combines a couple things.
- **[05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=319s)** — We're going to be using the band to get all the upper chest and your shoulders relaxed.
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=326s)** — So we're going to be kneeling and bending backwards with this band.
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=330s)** — Boy, this will take a lot of tension out of the entire body.
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=334s)** — So sometimes people will tell you that the fascia holds trauma.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=338s)** — But when we get into motions and severe stress and especially injury,
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=342s)** — or even the most severe type of stress, which is major losses,
- **[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=346s)** — I personally recommend the technique they use in Dianetics.
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=348s)** — And the word Dianetics means what the mind is doing to the body.
- **[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=352s)** — So let's say, for example, you're five years old and you're climbing a tree
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=355s)** — and the tree is in the front part of your yard and your friend's next to you.
- **[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=359s)** — And as you hit the ground, your friend is laughing at you.
- **[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=363s)** — And at the same time, it's raining.
- **[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=365s)** — And then your mother in the distance is saying, come in and eat.
- **[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=368s)** — It's time to eat. Of course, we have the impact, the dust around your sinuses
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=372s)** — and then the emotions that you might have of fear, the fear of falling.
- **[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=376s)** — And on top of everything, maybe you went slightly unconscious.
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=379s)** — When that happens, things in that moment can act as triggers
- **[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=383s)** — 20 years down the road or even longer.
- **[06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=385s)** — So let's say 20 years down the road, it's raining and you feel achiness
- **[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=390s)** — and you lower it back and you're not sure why.
- **[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=392s)** — Or someone's laughing at you and instead of having like a kind of a mild reaction,
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=397s)** — you have a really big reaction to that.
- **[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=399s)** — All of those triggers in that moment of unconsciousness and pain
- **[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=403s)** — can act like triggers later in life.
- **[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=406s)** — And this really explains those things that are hard to figure out,
- **[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=409s)** — especially with phobias and weird body problems that just come out of nowhere.
- **[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=413s)** — So yes, when you injure yourself, I think that the fascia and the muscles
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=416s)** — can go in this protect mode.
- **[06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=417s)** — But what really is underneath that is that those mental pictures
- **[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=421s)** — of that time where you had an earlier injury.
- **[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1kM4q8ffWk&t=424s)** — In summary, if we all end up really stiff when we get older,
