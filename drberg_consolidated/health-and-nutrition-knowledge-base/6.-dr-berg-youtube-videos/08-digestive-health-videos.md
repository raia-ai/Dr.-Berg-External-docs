- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=0s)** — I want to share seven signs of a leaky gut. We're dealing with this gut wall.
- **[00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=5s)** — And what happens is we have this really thin single layer of cells that is the barrier between
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=13s)** — your inside of your intestines versus the outside, where we have protection and absorption of about
- **[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=20s)** — 90% of all the nutrients. You have a mucus layer there. You have a lot of microbes. You have 80%
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=26s)** — of your immune system in that location. And when you have leaky gut, you have the start of inflammation.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=33s)** — But let's take a look at what the medical profession says about having inflammation in your
- **[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=40s)** — gut. Okay, dietary measures to improve this inflammation in your gut. You should increase
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=46s)** — soluble fiber intake. Now, right off the bat, that's the absolute worst thing to do. If you
- **[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=54s)** — have inflammation in your gut is to take more fiber. In fact, you want to just take that
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=60s)** — information and do the opposite. You want to go carnivore if you have inflammation in the gut,
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=64s)** — especially if it's very, very severe. Because as you have more fiber, you're going to create
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=70s)** — more inflammation. All right, I'm not done. I want to show you a couple of other things
- **[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=74s)** — here. If we look at the cause of this problem, the first thing it says, while the causes
- **[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=79s)** — of inflammation are still unknown, it is believed that the entire gut brain axis is affected.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=86s)** — They're talking about the connection between your gut and your brain. And so it doesn't
- **[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=92s)** — really give us any more information about causation. But it does talk about risk factors
- **[01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=98s)** — being older, prolonged fever, anxiety, depression, genetics can be a problem. They're
- **[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=110s)** — okay. I agree with that. Then they get into management, not curing it. But let's manage it.
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=117s)** — The number of treatments have been found to be effective. Increasing fiber. No, you don't want
- **[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=122s)** — to do that. Talk therapy, anti-spasmodic medication, and anti-depressants. Okay,
- **[02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=131s)** — so then they get into physical activity. You should exercise. Then they talk about medications.
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=136s)** — Then they're getting into vagus nerve stimulation. Okay, but you know what's missing? They're not
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=142s)** — talking about changing the diet. What you need to know is that most diseases are triggered
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=148s)** — by something that happens in your gut. And it has everything to do with the food that you're
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=155s)** — eating. It's not in Wikipedia. And so it's kind of missing information. And the problem is
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=160s)** — you don't see it because it's missing. And for the average person doing research,
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=165s)** — they won't really connect the dots most of the time. Now there's other things that go beyond
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=170s)** — food or that are in food that can create a problem like broad spectrum antibiotics.
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=177s)** — You start messing with your gut microbiome. And that's when you start to really go downhill
- **[03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=183s)** — because you need those microbes to help you digest. You don't need to piss them off and
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=190s)** — them change the relationship to be more pathogenic. And then you have also other things
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=196s)** — in food supply, like an herbicide called glyphosate in the GMO food. They actually
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=203s)** — patent it as an antibiotic. Now, if you look at glyphosate, they say, well, doesn't
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=208s)** — affect the human body. Well, yeah, it affects bacteria that are in your body. And so you
- **[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=215s)** — start exposing yourself to too much glyphosate. And now that creates an antibiotic effect.
- **[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=221s)** — And then you're told to consume whole grains. Wow. If you consume whole grains while you
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=228s)** — have a leaky gut, you are going to allow materials that go through that hole into your
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=235s)** — immune system. And it's going to create a huge immune reaction. You're going to start
- **[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=240s)** — allergies to all sorts of things that maybe you didn't have before. And not just with
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=246s)** — whole grains, but with other foods too, like the proteins. If you give a small child
- **[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=253s)** — milk, the proteins in that milk can cause leaky gut because the child does not have
- **[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=260s)** — the ability to digest those proteins early on at that age. And so now you actually create
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=267s)** — an irritation, a hole, bleeding. And that's one of the causes of anemia in small children
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=275s)** — that consume this milk too early. But of course, breast milk won't do it. And then if we take
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=282s)** — a look at the protein in grains, gluten, gluten is one of the only proteins that our
- **[04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=289s)** — bodies cannot digest. And then I think the last thing that really destroys this gut lining
- **[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=294s)** — is seed oils. So when you start to develop this leaky gut, we get this injury, we get inflammation.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=303s)** — Like if you right now had a cut on your finger and it was all red and it was swollen,
- **[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=308s)** — you could see it, you can protect it, you could put a bandaid on it. But if that's
- **[05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=313s)** — happening inside your colon, you can't see it. How do you know it's inflamed? I'm about
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=320s)** — to give you the symptoms to let you know. Number one, of course, you're going to have abdominal
- **[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=326s)** — pain or cramping in any part of the lower abdomen. I lived with that for decades.
- **[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=336s)** — And I just kind of pushed through. I thought it was normal. You should never have pain,
- **[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=342s)** — cramping, or any type of bloating in your digestive system. That means there's some type
- **[05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=348s)** — of inflammation going on. That's number one. Number two, constipation or diarrhea. Number three,
- **[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=355s)** — you're going to be fatigued because you're not digesting. And because food's not getting the
- **[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=360s)** — full digestion, you're going to lack energy. Then number four, you're going to feel brain
- **[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=366s)** — fog. So it's going to start to affect not just fatigue, but clarity. Number five,
- **[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=372s)** — it's going to affect your mood. You're going to have anxiety. And it's actually related to
- **[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=379s)** — your digestion. Number six, skin inflammation. Whatever's going on your skin is a really good
- **[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=386s)** — indication of your digestion. And being in practice for 30 years, I will tell you
- **[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=391s)** — these people that came in with skin problems, you just fix the gut and their skin problems go
- **[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=397s)** — If someone has really good skin, you know their digestion is good. And last one, number seven,
- **[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=404s)** — autoimmune diseases. 80% of your immune system is in the gut. And when you invade the immune
- **[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=410s)** — system and you bypass it, and you bypass normal immigration, and it no longer gets the
- **[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=416s)** — stamp of approval, it gets into the body and your body starts developing antibodies. It's
- **[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=422s)** — against your own tissues and it can be in any tissue. And now what happens is you start
- **[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=427s)** — getting inflammation in that area because we have this constant attack. Your body now considers
- **[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=433s)** — certain normal tissues foreign or a pathogen. And so if it identifies the thyroid as being
- **[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=442s)** — the invader, it'll start creating inflammation on your thyroid gland as a condition called
- **[07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=448s)** — And that originated in the gut. And it started with inflammation and leaky gut.
- **[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=455s)** — One of the best things you can do for any type of gut inflammation is eliminate a lot of things
- **[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=463s)** — that are creating inflammation. And this is where I would recommend the carnivore diet for
- **[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=467s)** — a couple months to start to heal the gut by eliminating all the things that are creating
- **[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=473s)** — In parallel with that, I would recommend taking something called glutamine and glycine,
- **[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=480s)** — two things that can actually heal it. And if you're on the carnivore diet,
- **[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=484s)** — you're consuming a lot of red meat and things like that, which are loaded with glutamine.
- **[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=488s)** — And so that can help you right there. But there's a little bit more information
- **[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8fUVut1AA&t=491s)** — you need to know about this topic. And for that, check out this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=0s)** — The best way to detoxify your liver. People automatically think,
- **[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=3s)** — Oh, it's too much alcohol. Or it's too much sugar or something like that.
- **[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=7s)** — Well, that doesn't even compare to what's really destroying the liver.
- **[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=10s)** — You're exposed to this every single day. And there's really only one way to fix it.
- **[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=13s)** — This entire topic is based on one piece of information.
- **[00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=17s)** — Pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, plastics, forever chemicals.
- **[00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=23s)** — All of this toxicity mimics estrogen. What? Mimics estrogen?
- **[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=27s)** — This is a cell. This hormone estrogen receptor is very, very different than other hormone receptors.
- **[00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=33s)** — All these other environmental toxins can fit into that estrogen receptor
- **[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=37s)** — and activate the estrogen effect in certain parts of your body.
- **[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=42s)** — What's really happening on a global scale is we're creating estrogen dominance.
- **[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=46s)** — Let's take a look at what happens when that estrogen receptor gets too triggered.
- **[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=50s)** — In the liver, you're not going to produce as much bile.
- **[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=53s)** — And bile is like the key thing to help eliminate the toxins in the chemicals.
- **[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=58s)** — If you don't have enough bile, the chemicals get recycled.
- **[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=61s)** — This can lead to an inflamed liver, fatty liver, cirrhosis.
- **[01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=64s)** — Let's talk about the breast tissue. That has estrogen receptors too.
- **[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=67s)** — We're dealing with the increased risk of breast cancer.
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=70s)** — Not from actual estrogen, but from chemicals that can fit into the estrogen receptor.
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=76s)** — There's estrogen receptors in the uterus. It can also affect fertility.
- **[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=80s)** — And definitely it affects the menstrual cycle.
- **[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=83s)** — Then you have receptors in your thyroid.
- **[01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=86s)** — And this is a classic situation where you're developing hypothyroidism
- **[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=91s)** — from the estrogen that goes into the thyroid.
- **[01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=93s)** — And by the way, too much estrogen equals too much fat, especially around the hips.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=97s)** — And even increase breast tissue in men.
- **[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=100s)** — Your skin has receptors for estrogen.
- **[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=103s)** — These toxins activate estrogen receptors which increase acne.
- **[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=107s)** — And there's receptors in the testes too. So that's going to decrease testosterone.
- **[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=111s)** — It's going to decrease sperm count.
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=114s)** — And also when they talk about postmenopausal females that are estrogen dominant,
- **[01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=117s)** — do you really think that's coming from estrogen?
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=120s)** — What happens is you're getting accumulation of this toxicity
- **[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=124s)** — which is activating the estrogen receptors.
- **[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=127s)** — Giving them the illusion that they have too much estrogen.
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=130s)** — When in reality, they have too many toxins.
- **[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=133s)** — So the name of these toxins that act like estrogen in the environment,
- **[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=137s)** — they're called Xenoestrogens.
- **[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=140s)** — If there's a spill of a certain chemical in a lake,
- **[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=143s)** — you get this feminization of fish,
- **[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=146s)** — males turning to females.
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=148s)** — And so these chemicals affect animals and humans.
- **[02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=152s)** — Young girls are going through their puberty a lot earlier.
- **[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=155s)** — Young boys have lower testosterone and lower sperm count.
- **[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=158s)** — So luckily, our liver is equipped with an entire detox machine
- **[02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=165s)** — to get rid of these chemicals, but only if it's not overloaded.
- **[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=169s)** — Well, I'm going to share with you right now
- **[02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=170s)** — what I think is the only solution to this problem.
- **[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=173s)** — In addition to, of course, avoiding these chemicals as much as you can,
- **[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=177s)** — but you cannot 100% avoid these chemicals.
- **[03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=180s)** — You want to support the liver's ability to detoxify.
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=184s)** — You're turning fat-siable chemicals, and that's what these are,
- **[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=188s)** — into water-siable chemicals.
- **[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=190s)** — It's in a group of vegetables called Perciverous Vegetables.
- **[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=194s)** — Perciverous vegetables like kale, broccoli, brussel sprouts,
- **[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=197s)** — arugula, cauliflower, all contain chemicals that can help detoxify
- **[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=203s)** — these poisons that are mimicking estrogen.
- **[03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=206s)** — And for those people that don't like a lot of vegetables,
- **[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=208s)** — you can get a concentrated version of the chemicals that are needed
- **[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=212s)** — in something called DIM.
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=214s)** — D-I-M. DIM is basically a concentrated cruciferous extract
- **[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=218s)** — that can help regulate the excess of the harmful estrogen
- **[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=222s)** — and convert that into something that's a lot less toxic.
- **[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=226s)** — And this is why a lot of people take DIM as a supplement,
- **[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=228s)** — but you don't need to even take that.
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=229s)** — You can eat the food that it comes from, which is cruciferous vegetables.
- **[03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=233s)** — Even one phytonutrient called sulforaphane,
- **[03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=236s)** — in broccoli sprouts, it's in radishes,
- **[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=239s)** — has the capacity to increase over 200 detox genes
- **[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=243s)** — and also feed the gut bacteria
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=246s)** — that can help you detoxify these chemicals too.
- **[04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=249s)** — Now, in the liver, there's a certain protein,
- **[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=252s)** — and it's called sex hormone-binding globulin.
- **[04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=255s)** — We want more of that to safeguard and protect you
- **[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=259s)** — against the excess of estrogen in the body,
- **[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=262s)** — especially to prevent cancer.
- **[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=264s)** — Well, it just so happens that cruciferous vegetables
- **[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=265s)** — have certain things in them to help increase
- **[04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=268s)** — that sex hormone-binding globulin.
- **[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=271s)** — And also, the phytonutrients, including DIM,
- **[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=273s)** — have the ability to reduce certain enzymes
- **[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=275s)** — to decrease the conversion of testosterone into estrogen.
- **[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=280s)** — But unfortunately, our bodies never evolved
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=282s)** — to deal with these environmental estrogen toxins.
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=287s)** — But our liver was designed to deal with plant estrogens,
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=291s)** — which can actually help us,
- **[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=293s)** — and they're in the cruciferous vegetables.
- **[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=295s)** — They're not going to actually increase the estrogen in your body.
- **[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=298s)** — What they're going to do is help dismantle the chemicals
- **[05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=300s)** — that are mimicking the estrogen.
- **[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=301s)** — So, you have a couple options.
- **[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=303s)** — Consuming more cruciferous vegetables in your diet.
- **[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=305s)** — You can take DIM as a supplement.
- **[05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=307s)** — There's a couple other things that are really good for the liver,
- **[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=310s)** — especially when dealing with this toxicity.
- **[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=312s)** — A supplement called NAC, which is really good for the liver,
- **[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=316s)** — and also the brain.
- **[05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=317s)** — Choline is another one that will also help you
- **[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=320s)** — get rid of fat off the liver.
- **[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=322s)** — So, the reason why this video is so important is,
- **[05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=324s)** — number one, to give you the awareness of something,
- **[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=327s)** — unfortunately, that it's almost impossible to avoid,
- **[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=330s)** — which is the problem.
- **[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=331s)** — But yet, at the same time, I gave you a solution,
- **[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=334s)** — just within your diet.
- **[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=335s)** — It doesn't have to be every day, you know, a few times a week.
- **[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=338s)** — So, at the very least, you can reduce the load
- **[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=341s)** — of estrogenic things that are hitting your liver on a daily basis.
- **[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=344s)** — And for additional information on how to get rid of
- **[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjX5l5Vla2M&t=347s)** — forever chemicals and plastics,
