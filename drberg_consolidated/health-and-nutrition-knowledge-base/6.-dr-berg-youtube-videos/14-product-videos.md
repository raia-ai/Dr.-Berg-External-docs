- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=0s)** — Today we are going to talk about Bill Gates' appeal and if it's safe. I did a pretty thorough
- **[00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=6s)** — research on Google to see if it was safe. And as I was reading the pages, it looked really safe.
- **[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=11s)** — In fact, it's been thoroughly fact checked. So we know it's probably going to be safe and we
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=15s)** — don't need to look any further. Until I took one additional look at the ingredients of this
- **[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=22s)** — appeal. And one of the things that was listed is that 99.34% of this product is listed as
- **[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=29s)** — other ingredients. Other ingredients? It doesn't tell you what's in it. So right there is a big red
- **[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=35s)** — flag. There's no transparency. We do know that there are mono and diglycerides in there, which
- **[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=41s)** — I'm going to talk about. But we don't know what else is in this product. Now, first of all,
- **[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=44s)** — what is a mono or a diglyceride? It's a emulsifier. What's an emulsifier? It's something
- **[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=51s)** — that helps to mix two things together. And I was able to look at the patents in this appeal
- **[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=57s)** — product and really kind of see more about the manufacturing process because they're using
- **[01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=63s)** — solvents in this process. And then they'll put in a metal like palladium and then put it under
- **[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=70s)** — high heats with hydrogen. So it's like a fat like substance that they're using, but they
- **[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=76s)** — could be making this partially hydrogenated product, which is trans fats. That's how they
- **[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=85s)** — called hydrogenation. And when you look a little bit more into this, you see that there's also
- **[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=90s)** — traces of cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic. I'm like, what? But they're in very small amounts
- **[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=99s)** — and they say that it's safe because it's below the certain standards that they use.
- **[01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=105s)** — But my question is like, if you're consuming these chronically over time,
- **[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=109s)** — have you ever done safety studies on that? They also add polyethylene glycol. I mean, isn't that
- **[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=114s)** — stuff they use in antifreeze? And these two solvents, for example. So are they toxic? Well,
- **[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=120s)** — they said that they take them out. But my other question is like, what chemical do you
- **[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=125s)** — use to take those solvents out? And are those chemicals clean? They don't tell you. I did a
- **[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=130s)** — video on this. This is the industry's loophole. They can do their own safety studies,
- **[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=136s)** — submit them to the FDA, get them approved. In fact, trans fats at one time were
- **[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=142s)** — generally recognized as safe until they found out they weren't safe. And also, if you have less
- **[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=148s)** — than a half of a gram of trans fats, the FDA says you can round it down to zero trans fats.
- **[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=154s)** — But what was really interesting is this point that if you classify something like this as an
- **[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=160s)** — emulsifier and not as a lipid, which is a fat, you're exempt from the FDA's ban of
- **[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=168s)** — trans fats. Amazing. Now, there's also another controversy over whether this appeal is really a
- **[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=175s)** — coating or a fungicide because both the EPA and the Organic Materials Review Institute
- **[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=184s)** — says that it's a fungicide used after harvest. But appeal advertises this as a protective
- **[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=191s)** — coating. So there's a lot of problems with this product. We don't know if they added
- **[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=196s)** — carrageenan in there, which creates a lot of problems for people. And some of the other
- **[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=201s)** — edible coatings that they use are things like beeswax, which I think is a lot better. But
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=207s)** — they also use shellac. I mean, don't they use shellac in woodworking, staining, or sometimes
- **[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=214s)** — they'll put that on your nails? Is that safe? And then also sometimes they use paraffin wax,
- **[03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=219s)** — which is made from petroleum, which actually is flammable. So I learned a lot about these
- **[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=225s)** — coatings that they're apparently putting on our fruits and vegetables, especially if you bring
- **[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=229s)** — these fruits or vegetables home and you want to clean them off, right? So if you have this
- **[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=235s)** — appeal coating around it, how are you going to take the pesticides out if it's conventional?
- **[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=241s)** — Now they do have an organic version, but sometimes with these organic products, you don't
- **[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=246s)** — know if those are any safer. Personally, I am not going to be buying my fruits or vegetables
- **[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=251s)** — with a peel, because first of all, you can't clean it off, but you can actually maybe cut the peel
- **[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=256s)** — off. But where is all the nutrition? Most of the nutrition is in the peel. So it's going
- **[04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=261s)** — to be really hard to take out any pesticides, insecticides, or any microbes. I mean, who knows
- **[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=267s)** — if there's E. coli or salmonella? There's been outbreaks on that. But if you put that
- **[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=272s)** — coating on there, that could actually seal that microbe in there. So as you can see,
- **[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=277s)** — I have a lot of issues with this appeal. You might want to just buy fruits or vegetables that
- **[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=282s)** — don't have this coating. And yes, they might go bad a little bit quicker. But at least you can
- **[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=287s)** — wash them off with something more natural. If you want to know how to do that, you should watch
- **[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X0LKxCz1a0&t=291s)** — this video right here.

- **[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7wLGQfoCcI&t=0s)** — This topic is a little bit controversial. It might potentially upset certain people because they had this certain thought that the mother inside the apple cider vinegar really was the same thing as the sediment at the bottom of the container.
- **[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7wLGQfoCcI&t=15s)** — So let's discuss this topic. When you start out with apples, and you go to alcohol, you need a certain type of yeast. This is the first step of fermentation.
- **[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7wLGQfoCcI&t=26s)** — There's also a second step of fermentation where you go from alcohol to vinegar. When we're talking about apple cider vinegar, we're talking about acetic acid as the type of vinegar. And that uses a very specific type of bacteria.
- **[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7wLGQfoCcI&t=39s)** — And when we talk about this thing called the mother, we're really talking about a combination of two things. Friendly bacteria and number two, very specific enzymes like cellulase, hemicellulase, and pectinase. And there's others as well.
- **[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7wLGQfoCcI&t=60s)** — The true mother is really bacteria and enzymes. Now I have a question for you. Can you see an enzyme? When's the last time you actually saw an enzyme? They're invisible. What about a bacteria? Can you actually see bacteria? Chances are no.
- **[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7wLGQfoCcI&t=78s)** — So the true mother, bacteria and enzymes, cannot be seen. When you see the sediment at the bottom of the container, what you're looking at is kind of something left over from this fermentation process. And so the only thing you can really tell about this sediment is it's completely unfiltered.
- **[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7wLGQfoCcI&t=97s)** — It does not mean that there's enzymes or probiotics in that sediment. When you heat apple cider vinegar, pasteurize it, you kill the bacteria and the enzymes. When you use high pressure, you can also kill bacteria and enzymes. So you could potentially have a product with that sediment on the bottom of the container and have no true mother, just particles of these apples or some of the fiber that was left.
- **[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7wLGQfoCcI&t=126s)** — Now in the United States, there's over 50 different organic apple cider vinegar brands, which are supplied by three main companies. Now one of the most popular brands, Bragg, was started by Patricia Bragg, who unfortunately passed away this year, 2023, at the age of 94. But she sold her company in 2020 when she retired to a private equity firm.
- **[02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7wLGQfoCcI&t=150s)** — Now what many people don't know about Bragg is that they were a marketing company. They never supplied or produced their own product. In fact, from the year 2006 to 2021, most of their apple cider vinegar was from another company called Fairchilds, which by the way, is the only brand that produces and sells their product. All these other brands are like private labeling from three companies. But Fairchilds no longer supplies Bragg.
- **[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7wLGQfoCcI&t=179s)** — Now I don't get any financial kickbacks from Fairchilds. When I see a product that's high quality, I'd like to promote it. And the challenge with a truly high quality organic raw apple cider vinegar is that it's much more difficult in creating wine actually, because you can't make it with hybrid yeast cultures. You can't use nitrogens, you can't use phosphates, you can't use sulfur dioxide, and you can't use pasteurization. Like wine is pasteurized.
- **[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7wLGQfoCcI&t=207s)** — From my research, Fairchilds is the best on the market. And the thing about Fairchilds is that they don't dilute it. It's undiluted, unfiltered, it's raw, it's organic. The acidity level is like 6.3, which is 25% stronger than Bragg. Because unfortunately, Bragg now adds water to the product and dilutes it. Anyway, I wanted to clear up this confusion on what this actual true mother really is. And it's not just sediment. It's something that's invisible.
- **[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7wLGQfoCcI&t=237s)** — And to really know that a product has this mother in it, you really have to know the source and the manufacturing process of the company. Now because of the censoring and the suppressing of the algorithms on YouTube, it's becoming more difficult to find my content. And there's a lot of content that I cannot put on YouTube, unfortunately.
